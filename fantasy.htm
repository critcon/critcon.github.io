    look at the title and you know what film this Italian/Turkish 
   co-production is paying &quot;homage&quot; to. Rick Spear (the late 
   David Warbeck), a globe-trotting adventurer and cat burglar, and his 
   main squeeze Carol (Susie Sudlow) travel to Turkey on a business trip 
   where Rick breaks into the mansion of Lord Dean (John Steiner), a 
   crippled billionaire, and steals an ancient tablet that is a key to 
   untold riches. He is caught, but it was all a test by Lord Dean. He 
   hires Rick to locate and steal the Sceptor of Gilgamesh,<A HREF="ark_of_the_sun_god_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ark of the sun god vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   located in the hidden Temple of the Sun God, somewhere in the Turkish 
   desert. The sceptor is said to contain magical powers that will bring 
   riches and good fortune to whomever possesses it. Rick has 
   competition for the sceptor from Prince Abdullah (Aytekin Akkaya) and 
   he has his inept men try to kidnap Carol, but Rick saves the day 
   (with a well-aimed water hose). As Abdullah's bumbling goons try to 
   stop him (they can't seem to do anything right), Rick begins a 
   perilous journey through the desert with alcoholic tour guide Beetle 
   (Luciano Pigozzi, a.k.a. &quot;Alan Collins&quot;) and new sidekick 
   Mohammed (Ricardo Palacios). Traveling by helicopter, they land at a 
   mountain range that looks like a giant swastika. With Abdullah's men 
   dogging their every move and Lord Dean revealing his ultimate secret, 
   Rick and his team must maneuver a series of ancient boobytraps, 
   including rats, snakes, a giant rolling stone wheel, lava and a sand 
   and pulley puzzle (that nearly kills Rick) before they can get near 
   the sceptor. Abdullah takes command before Rick can get his hands on 
   the sceptor and he triggers one last boobytrap that brings down the 
   whole temple.&nbsp; Director <A HREF="antonio_margheriti_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Antonio

   trouble than he anticipated, he turns to Lord Dean and says. &quot;I

   outlandish car chase in the desert (using Firebirds and Camaros) that 
   comes out of nowhere, gun fights, explosions, a sword fight and lots 
   of humor. Not particularly bloody (it would probably have earned a PG 
   if submitted to the MPAA) and no nudity at all, this film is an 
   enjoyable fantasy/adventure that can be viewed by both children and 
   adults. Just don't set your sights too high and you should have a

   Stupid, but bloody, Italian-made sword and sandal fantasy about a 
   tribe of female warriors who look at men as nothing but slaves or 
   vessels only good for their &quot;seed&quot; (One Amazon says, 
   &quot;The male of the species is the most inferior creature on 
   Earth!&quot;). When one of their own is caught making love to Zeno 
   (Lincoln Tate), they take him prisoner (after he cuts an Amazon's arm 
   off in a sword fight) and make him a slave and then hang his lover 
   upside down over a pit of sharpened stakes and set the rope on fire. 
   She eventually falls and gets impaled multiple times. Zeno escapes 
   (by putting a poisonous scorpion down the back of an Amazon, killing 
   her) and meets kindly Valeria (Paola Tedesco; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#RingDarkness77/79">RING

   wounds, he tells her that if she should ever need his help, he and 
   his people will be there for her. That time will come all too soon. 
   When Antiope (Gena Woods), the Queen of the Amazons, attacks Valeria's<A HREF="battle_of_the_amazons_1973b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/battle of the amazons dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   village with her warriors, killing Valeria's father and many of the 
   women and older men, while kidnapping many of the young men as slaves 
   (A few moments earlier, we witness the Amazons kill all their 
   previous slaves in a mass slaughter to make room for the new ones!), 
   Valeria travels to Zeno's village to ask for help. After making a 
   deal with Zeno and three of his best warriors (She says, &quot;Three 
   sacks of crushed oats, ten panther skins, ten bear skins, five hogs 
   and a measure of gold, but that's it!&quot;), they go back to 
   Valeria's village and begin training the villagers for combat. It's 
   going to be an uphill battle, since the villagers are nothing but 
   simple farmers. The Amazons, meanwhile, are busy having orgies with 
   their new slaves (and each other) and planning their next attack on 
   Valeria's village. Unbeknownst to Valeria and Zeno, Antiope has a spy 
   in their village. When Valeria, Zeno and his men pull a surprise raid 
   on the Amazon's slave camp, freeing all the slaves, Valeria's 
   wannabe-suitor Erno (Benito Stefanelli), who is jealous of Zeno, 
   turns traitor and goes to the Amazon's village to tell Antiope of 
   Zeno's plans, only to learn of the spy and lose his life (by double 
   spear impalement). When the Amazons attack Valeria's village in the 
   finale, we learn the identity of the spy and Zeno and his men 
   face-off against Antiope and her Amazons, with an able assist from 
   Valeria and her female warriors.&nbsp; This nonsensical fantasy owes

   violence, including rape, orgies (both straight and lesbian), 
   impalements (by spears, swords and spikes), dismemberments and 
   hand-to-hand combat (including some hilarious gladiatorial martial 
   arts). It's quite apparent in the final face-off between the Amazons 
   and Valeria's village that many of the masked Amazons are actually 
   men in wigs (the arms don't lie). If you like plenty of trampoline 
   action (who doesn't?), topless women (count me in!) and head-shaking 
   dialogue (&quot;You interrupted my dance of love!&quot; and &quot;This
    world was made for hate, not love!&quot;), you could do a lot worse 
   than this mindless Italian fantasy. It's like one of those 60's 
   Hercules peplum films, with added copious nudity and gore. Also 
   starring Lucretia Love, Mirta Miller, Solvay Stubing, Francesco 
   (Frank) Brana, Pilar Clement, Riccardo Pizzuti and Robert Vidmark.

   released theatrically by American International Pictures), it can be 
   purchased on an All Region DVD from Eurovista Digital Entertainment.

    BERMUDA DEPTHS</A></B> is the story of a woman named Jennie Haniver 
   (80's TV star Connie Sellecca in her film debut) and her friendship 
   with a giant turtle (we're talking Gamera proportions here, folks). 
   As a young girl, Jennie and a young boy named Magnus raised the 
   turtle since it was a hatchling, but Magnus and Jennie lost touch 
   when something huge killed Magnus' scientist father and destroyed 
   their Cliffside Bermuda mansion, <A HREF="bermuda_depths_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bermuda depths poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>forcing
    Magnus to move away and be raised by relatives in the States. But 
   now, the fully-grown Magnus (Leigh McCloskey; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Inferno1980">INFERNO</A></B> 
   - 1980) has returned to his childhood roots to learn the truth about 
   his father's death. Magnus teams up with childhood chum Eric (Carl 
   Weathers; <B><A HREF="bucktown_1974.htm">BUCKTOWN</A></B> - 1975), 
   who works on a deep-sea trawler with marine biologist Dr. Paulis 
   (Burl Ives; <B><A HREF="earthbound_1981.htm">EARTHBOUND</A></B> - 
   1981 and the narrator of <B>RUDOLPH</B>), who is looking for 
   &quot;unusual life&quot; in the deeps of the ocean (evidence which 
   they find rather quickly; for as soon as Magnus sets foot on the 
   trawler, something chews its way through a metal fishing net). Eric 
   wife, Doshan (Julie Woodson), doesn't like the idea of Magnus working 
   with Eric because he has psychological issues that date back to the 
   day Magnus lost his father (it is also revealed that Magnus lost his 
   mother at sea the same year), which resulted in Magnus not being able 
   to hold on to a job his entire adult life. When Magnus tells Dr. 
   Paulis that he has just talked to Jennie Haniver, Dr. Paulis tells 
   him that it is impossible because she is nothing but a local legend 
   and never existed. Dr. Paulis' maid, Delia (Ruth Attaway), elaborates 
   further about Jennie's legend (Flashback Alert!) and tells Magnus 
   that Jennie only appears to those who are about to drown. To make a 
   long story short, Magnus and Jennie fall in love and the question 
   becomes to the audience whether Jennie is actually real or just a 
   figment of Magnus' very fragile psyche. When Dr. Paulis backs out of 
   the expedition (probably due to the film's budgetary restrictions), 
   Eric and Magnus take the trawler and hunt the giant turtle with a new 
   type of speargun (that looks more like a bazooka) that Eric has 
   invented. When Eric accidentally spears Jennie instead, the giant 
   turtle goes on a path of destruction in retribution, which results in 
   the death of Dr. Paulis (in a hilariously inept helicopter crash) and 
   Eric (who gets dragged underwater by his own contraption). Only 
   Magnus survives and he leaves Bermuda much worse then when he 
   returned to it, with a respected marine biologist dead and Doshan now 
   a widow. My God, I hope he has no more friends!&nbsp; Of the Tom 
   Kotani - Rankin/Bass trilogy, <B><A HREF="bermuda_depths_1978c.htm">THE
    BERMUDA DEPTHS</A></B> is the least successful of the three, thanks 
   to a deadly dull and slow-moving screenplay by William Overgard (who 
   also wrote the other two films) and a wooden performance by Leigh 
   McCloskey, who has the emotional range of a piece of granite (hell, 
   the giant turtle shows more range than him!). Besides the beautiful 
   Bermuda location photography and underwater camerawork (which really 
   &quot;pops&quot; on this DVD-R), this film has very little to offer 
   discerning fantasy film fans, as it takes over an hour to finally 
   catch our first look at the giant turtle and, until then, it is just 
   endless dialogue scenes with very little action, interspersed with 
   flashbacks and some shots of obvious model boats in someone's 
   bathtub. Since this is a Rankin/Bass production, don't expect any 
   foul language or naked female flesh and the violence doesn't get any 
   bloodier than a brief shot of Jennie floating motionless underwater 
   with a spear sticking out of her side (a shot that was missing from 
   the TV prints). Burl Ives over-emotes shamelessly (When Magnus asks 
   him if his father was eaten, he screams, &quot;YES, he was 
   EATEN!&quot;) and poor Carl Weathers was probably thinking to 
   himself, &quot;Christ, this is the best I can do after <B><A HREF="rocky_1976.htm">ROCKY</A></B>?&quot;

   Zamora), for something to eat, he asks her what she wants. She 
   replies. &quot;A cookie for me and some raw meat for my doll.&quot; 
   Simon finds the request quite unusual, but he gives her both anyway. 
   That night, a flock of birds attack Diane while she is standing on 
   deck, so she uses the doll as a shield. When Peter and Sybil hear 
   their daughter scream, they go running to her, and Peter notices that 
   the doll has blood on its lips and littering the deck are the bodies 
   of dead birds, all of them having their throats ripped out and nearly 
   decapitated, as if someone (or something) had bitten them! The Black 
   Whale III begins to violently rock back and forth and almost 
   capsizes, but it stops as quickly as it started and Captain Briggs 
   foolishly thinks strong undercurrents were the cause. Captain Briggs 
   then sees a faint light shining in the distance and Alan realizes it 
   is a ship signaling an SOS in Morse Code. When Alan answers the SOS 
   with a spotlight, the distant light signals to him that the name of 
   their ship is the &quot;City Of Glasgow&quot;, but Alan says that 
   couldn't be, the City Of Glasgow was lost at sea...a hundred years 
   ago! The distant light then disappears and Captain Briggs tells Alan 
   that the ship's radar said there was never anything out there the 
   entire time he was signaling the ship. Now, any normal person would 
   have gotten the hell out of there, but the stubborn Edward insists 
   that the ship take him to the appointed destination, where he 
   believes Atlantis is located.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Edward, Alan, Michelle and Billy (Andres Garcia, 
   Jr.) don wetsuits and scuba gear and dive to the bottom of the ocean, 
   where Edward believes Atlantis is located. They find a bunch of 
   ancient stone pillars on the ocean floor (after killing two sharks 
   for daring to swim in the same water as them!), but an earthquake (?) 
   occurs and the stone pillars begin falling (this sequence is very 
   well done and it looks like the stunt people earned their paychecks, 
   as we see one stone pillar smack one of them on the head and their 
   reaction couldn't be faked!), trapping Michelle's legs underwater, as 
   her oxygen begins to deplete. A quick-thinking Alan surfaces and has 
   Gordon and crewmember Tony (Mario Arevalo) get him full tanks of 
   oxygen, saving Michelle from certain death. The Captain uses the 
   ship's rope to pull the pillar off of Michelle's legs and Alan brings 
   her on the ship. Peter, who is a doctor, tends to Michelle's legs, 
   but the wounds are severe and Captain Briggs heads his ship to the 
   island of Bimini, where there is a hospital. Diane, who has just 
   locked Simon in the freezer (Peter finds him before he freezes to 
   death), tells everyone over dinner that she talked to a man nobody on 
   the ship knows and he told her how everyone on the ship is going to 
   die, saying that Simon will be the first. Peter tells Sybil that 
   Michelle's wounds are so severe that she will have to have both legs 
   amputated if she is to survive. Captain Briggs overhears the 
   conversation and asks Peter why he doesn't do the amputations if time 
   is of the essence, a drunk Peter telling him he can't bring himself 
   to do it, Captain Briggs calling him a coward. Believe it or not, 
   there are more pressing problems, as the ship is not able to get in 
   contact with anyone, not even in Bimini. And a bad storm is 
   approaching the ship, the likes of which Captain Briggs has never 
   seen before.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Edward is sick and tired of Diane treating the doll as a real 
   person, so he takes it away from her, placing it in the same room as 
   an unconscious Michelle. Gordon tells the Captain that one of the 
   engines is not working and it looks like the propeller hit a rock, 
   but there should not be any jutting rocks in water this deep. As the 
   ship is being battered by the storm, Kim and Edward see Diane on deck 
   and they are knocked overboard by a wave trying to get to her. Alan 
   and Tony take a rubber raft to find them, but they are unsuccessful. 
   Simon is found dead in the galley, his death an apparent accident, 
   looking like he fell on a broken bottle that slashed his neck during 
   the storm. When the storm is over, the ship is in one piece, but they 
   are hopelessly lost and only have one working engine. Only Gordon has 
   sense enough to realize that the doll is the cause of their problems, 
   seeing Diane talking to the doll and knowing it is the cause of all 
   their problems, wanting to throw it overboard, but Captain Briggs 
   tells him to leave the poor girl alone, ordering him to put on scuba 
   gear and fix the broken propeller, only when he dives underwater, the 
   propeller starts rotating and beheads him! The Captain and Alan run 
   to the engine room to stop the engine and find Diane there. She tells 
   them the doll started the engine and told her that her grandmother 
   and grandfather are now with the &quot;living people&quot; underwater 
   and now so is Gordon. The ship's radio then goes screwy, playing SOS 
   and mayday messages from long ago and they then hear their own mayday 
   message from the night before. A drunk Peter tells an unconscious 
   Michelle, &quot;Michelle, you're beyond hope!&quot;, but that is the 
   least of their problems, as Diane knows who is going to die next.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Alan takes Michelle and Dave on the rubber raft and head towards 
   Bimini (Diane says, &quot;Goodbye Michelle!&quot;, like it was her 
   funeral). A sloshed Peter tells Billy that everything is hopeless, 
   not knowing that his drunken rantings are actually true, as moments 
   after Diane tells Aunt Sybil she is the next to die, she disappears. 
   We then see that the doll has turned into a diabolical 
   flesh-and-blood child with bloody lips. <A HREF="bermuda_triangle_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bermuda triangle france poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Michelle
    dies on the raft and something large and white appears under the 
   raft. The film ends with Captain Briggs finally getting in touch with 
   the Coast Guard in Bimini, but after hearing the Captain's mayday 
   message, the assistant radio man tells his mate he must not have 
   heard the message correctly, because the Black Whale III disappeared 
   twelve years ago when the Martin family charted it for an outing. The 
   closing credits then show us the real names of all the ships and 
   planes that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle over the past hundred 
   years and ends with, &quot;Who Will Be Next?&quot;, as we see the 
   creepy doll floating in the ocean, waiting for the next ship to pick 
   her up.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is actually a creepy film that tries to explain nothing, doing 
   it in a way that will give all believers in this nonsense the 
   willies. I always thought that the theories about the Bermuda 
   Triangle were a pile of crap, as any large body of water has the same 
   amount of disappearances it has. Pilot or mechanical error are 
   usually the causes of disappearances and the deep water hides its 
   secrets and not leave a trace, as we learned by the recent 
   disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 on March 8, 2014, 
   but some people will always have their own theories, no matter how 
   outlandish they sound and the sheep-like populace are more than 
   willing to accept them. Director/co-screenwriter Rene Cardona Jr. (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Night 1000 Cats">NIGHT

    MAGIC WITH BUDDHA</A><A NAME="BlackMagicWithBuddh"></A> (1983) -</B> 
   It's time once again for another crazy-assed Hong Kong fantasy horror 
   film. In Papau, New Guinea, black magician Master Abdullah leads Ben 
   (Chen Kuan Tai) through the jungle until they get to a cave. Inside 
   the cave is a coffin containing a mummy, which Master Abdullah 
   instructs Ben to stab in the heart with a sacrificial dagger. The 
   mummy suddenly springs to life, but Master Abdullah cuts off it's 
   head, performs a spell on it's skull (which involves Abdullah 
   shooting laser beams from his fingertips!), splits the skull open and 
   puts the mummy's pulsating brain in a box. He gives Ben the box and 
   tells him that he can make one wish whenever he wants, but after he 
   makes that wish, he must immediately sprinkle holy water (which he 
   also supplies Ben), on the brain so the brain can find peace in the 
   hereafter. If he doesn't, the wish could come back to bite Ben in the 
   ass (I think we can all see where this is heading). Ben heads back to 
   Hong Kong (Abdullah perishes in the cave when it catches on fire and 
   boulders crush him to death!), where he is greeted by his 
   fianc&eacute;e Annie (Candy Yu) at the airport and makes the 
   discovery that the brain can become invisible (a Customs agent asks 
   to see what's in the box and when he opens it, the brain has 
   disappeared). Ben has returned to marry Annie, but her elderly, 
   hospitalized father objects to the marriage, as does Annie's brother 
   Kit. Ben uses the brain to wish for a million dollars to impress Kit 
   and Annie's father, but when the money doesn't come quickly enough, 
   he asks his sister for a loan and she turns him down. Angry, he 
   storms out of the h<A HREF="black_magic_with_buddha_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black magic with buddha hong kong poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ouse
    after wishing his sister would &quot;go to Hell&quot; and goes to a 
   bar to drown his sorrows, not realizing that his latest wish is about 
   to come true. While Ben is getting drunk as a skunk, his sister is 
   attacked by supernatural forces, tossed off a balcony and, finally, 
   thrown through a window and dies. Ben inherits one million dollars 
   thanks to the death of his sister, but instead of following Master 
   Abdullah's advice and using the holy water on the brain, he grows 
   greedy and demands more wishes. As you can probably guess, things are 
   about to turn bad for Ben and those around him. Ben wishes to marry 
   Annie and suddenly her father changes his mind and gives his 
   blessing. The wedding ceremony is a huge affair, but when Kit insults 
   Ben at the reception, Ben storms off in a huff. That night, Ben takes 
   a shower in his palatial new home and the water turns to blood. Annie 
   spots the brain crawling up a window and screams, stepping on a dead 
   monkey while running away! Ben pleads for the brain to leave them 
   alone, but the brain will have none of that nonsense. The next 
   morning, their maid finds a corpse of a dog missing it's brain at the 
   front door. Folks, all this happens within the first thirty minutes 
   of the film and what come next is even crazier, as Ben gets deeper in 
   dutch with the brain. Ben wishes for the deaths of Kit and Annie's 
   father so he can take over the family business, but when a nosy Annie 
   accidentally breaks the bottle of holy water (which should have been 
   used on the brain long before this), the brain goes totally berserk 
   and no one is safe. Is there any way to put the genie back in the 
   bottle before it is too late? Perhaps a sorcerer could help...&nbsp; 
   Filled with many strange sights and off-the-wall deaths, <B>BLACK 
   MAGIC WITH BUDDHA</B>, directed by popular Chinese actor/filmmaker Lo 
   Lieh (<B><A HREF="5_fingers_of_death_1972.htm">5 FINGERS OF DEATH</A></B>

   - 1975; and hundreds of others; he appears as the sorcerer here) and 
   written by Chiu Chi Kin, is a treat for fans of Hong Kong fantasy 
   horror. This is a slight reworking of The Monkey's Paw, where the 
   moral of the story is to be careful what you wish for because wishes 
   never have a way of turning out how you hope they will. Half the fun 
   here is watching the pulsating brain (a very cheap bladder effect, 
   but strangely compelling nonetheless) doing its dirty work, whether 
   it's crawling into Kit's bubble bath and killing him or slithering 
   along the ground, walls and windows (while the sound of heaving 
   breathing is heard on the soundtrack [which is strange in itself 
   because the brain doesn't have lungs!]), as it attaches itself to 
   people's bodies, sucking out their brains while pleading &quot;Let me 
   go!&quot; (strange again, since it has no lips or tongue, not to 
   mention a voice box!). All the brain wants is to be returned to the 
   hereafter so it can be at peace, but the stupid humans keep trying to 
   use it for their own gain. The latter part of the film is a complete 
   hoot, as Ben tries to get rid of the brain any way he can; by burying 
   it, crushing it under a boulder and setting it on fire, but time and 
   time again the brain returns to terrorize him. On one such occasion, 
   the brain covers the windshield of Ben's car in blood, forcing Ben to 
   lose control of the car and run into the sorcerer, who loses his 
   pants, but is otherwise unharmed! This sets up the film's wild 
   finale, where the sorcerer performs an exorcism to rid Ben of the 
   brain (but not before he gives Ben a good ass-kicking just for the 
   hell of it!). Ben ends up vomiting the brain in little pieces, but 
   the brain makes itself whole again (thanks to some reverse camerawork 
   and stop-motion effects) and what comes next is a truly exceptional 
   example of cinema of the bizarre. I won't spoil it for everyone by 
   giving it away, but it involves a statue of Buddha coming to life, 
   the brain growing to gigantic proportions and the film turning into a 
   bastardized version of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Incredible Melting">THE
    INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN</A></B> (1976). I don't know what was in the 
   water in Hong Kong during the 70's &amp; 80's, but they turned out 
   scores of these weird and wild films that puts anything made in the 
   U.S. during the same period look timid in comparison. <B>BLACK MAGIC

   Another outrageous Indonesian fantasy from director Ratno Timoer, who 
   previously gave us the unbelievable <B><A HREF="#Devil'sSword">THE 
   DEVIL'S SWORD</A></B> (1984) and the unclassifiable <B><A HREF="action.htm#RevengeOfNinja1984">REVENGE
    OF NINJA</A></B> (1984). The film opens with an entire village being 
   slaughtered when they won't give up the location of their ancestor's 
   treasure. Enter blind warrior Barda (Advent Bangun; who looks to be 
   wearing an outfit made from the skin of the Creature from the Black 
   Lagoon!) and his pet monkey (who really serves no purpose in this 
   film), as they walk through the village littered with the bodies of 
   dead men, women and children and he makes a remark about man's 
   inhumanity to man. We then cut to the village ruled by the evil Raden 
   Parda, who is holding a huge ritual where the entire village prays to 
   their god (a huge stone statue with red glowing eyes) and sacrifice a 
   virgin to him. Unbeknownst to most of the villagers, when the virgin 
   walks into the crotch of the statue, she is actually walking into 
   Parna's private bedroom, where we see him make love to the virgin 
   while miniature pink, white and red styrofoam balls fall around and 
   nearly engulf them! When Parna sends his men to capture virgin 
   village girl Sirimbi (Enny Beatrice), Barda steps in and defeats 
   nearly a dozen of Parna's men (When they report back to their boss 
   that they were beaten-up by a blind man, Parna says, &quot;Godamned 
   idiots! Are you telling me you can't even catch a blind man? Maybe I

   all of you blinded, huh? You bunch of idiots!&quot;). Barda becomes 
   the protector of Sirimbi's family (Her father says, &quot;We all hate 
   Raden Parna. He's got to be the forerunner of Satan!&quot;) and as he 
   listens to Parna's men torture and kill some slaves that work in his 
   gold mine (We see them kill a young boy by slashing his chest open 
   with a sword and kill another man by impaling him with a spear), he 
   vows to bring Parna down. While Barda is with Sirimbi's father, 
   Parna's men capture Sirimbi and her hot-headed brother Yagi (Harry 
   Capri). Barda steps in and creates a diversion where he throws a huge 
   boulder in the air and shatters it by hurling his staff in it's 
   direction. He then picks up Sirimbi and Yagi and flies away with them 
   in his arms! Needless to say, Parna is pissed (He says to his head 
   henchman, &quot;Perhaps I should just pluck your eyes out of your 
   stupid head! Because they're of no use to you, are they?&quot;), so 
   he travels to Sirimbi's village in his golden eagle chariot and 
   offers to make Sirimbi his queen if she will marry him. She refuses 
   and Barda challenges Parna to a magical duel. Then the shit really 
   hits the fan. Since what I just described to you takes place during 
   the first 35 minutes of the film, you can expect much more lunacy in 
   the remaining 50 minutes!&nbsp; As with all Indonesian fantasies, 
   such as <B><A HREF="#Warrior1981">THE WARRIOR</A></B> series (<B><A HREF="#Warrior2">THE
    WARRIOR 2</A></B>, also known as <B><A HREF="warrior_against_the_blind_swordsman_1983.htm">THE
    WARRIOR AGAINST THE BLIND SWORDSMAN</A></B>, starred Advent Bangun 
   playing basically the same character he does here, even if he uses a 
   different name and carries a bigger staff in that film), it doesn't 
   make much sense but, Jesus Christ, it's entertaining as hell. Filled 
   with colorful characters (including a bad guy working at the mine 
   with an unusual patch of chest hair that I just couldn't take my eyes 
   off of!), outrageous set-pieces and some of the funniest dubbed 
   dialogue this side of an Arizal film, <B><A HREF="blind_warrior_1985c.htm">THE
    BLIND WARRIOR</A></B> is something every Indonesian fantasy fan 
   should search out. The final 30 minutes is some of the most 
   off-the-wall stuff you will ever see. Barda's battle with a flaming 
   rag, his descent into the &quot;Hole In Hell&quot; (Parna's head 
   henchman says to him, &quot;It's a shame you're blind. If you were 
   able to see, then you would die of horror!&quot;), where he fights a 
   bunch of decaying zombie women and Yagi and the rebel's assault on 
   Parna's gold mine (where blowguns, arrows, pitchforks, swords and 
   spears are used and the bad guy with the weird chest hair dies only 
   after he takes an arrow, blowgun dart, knife and, finally, a spear to 
   his chest!) are visual highlights. The final half hour is a non-stop 
   gorefest (including three amazing decapitations as well as a guy 
   getting cut in half at the waist!) and the film has some colorful set 
   designs (including a really bright blood-red lake) and 
   unintentionally hilarious dialogue (much of it relating to eye or 
   lack thereof). Director Ratno Timoer is batting 3-for-3 in my book 
   and someone should really release more of his films to 
   English-speaking audiences. The fullscreen DVD I viewed looks to have 
   been compiled from different sources (at one point, Japanese 
   subtitles appear on-screen), but it is very sharp with rich colors. A 
   must-own! A Terror Vision (British DVD; PAL Region 2) Release. <B>Not Rated</B>.

    BOXER'S OMEN</A><A NAME="Boxer'sOmen"></A> (1983) -</B> I think my 
   mind has just been blown. In this insane Shaw Brothers production, 
   Chan Hung (Philip Ko; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SeedingOfAGhost">SEEDING
    OF A GHOST</A></B> - 1983) witnesses his brother getting his neck 
   broken in a martial arts tournament by dirty fighting Thai boxer Ba 
   Bo (Bolo Yeung). Chan promises his now paraplegic brother that he 
   will get even for this injustice, so he travels to Thailand and tells 
   Ba Bo that he will be dead within a year. Earlier, Chan (who is a 
   Triad enforcer) was saved from a deadly trap in a warehouse by some 
   criminal adversaries when a mysterious monk with a pronounced aura 
   suddenly appears and kills all his rivals. Ever since that incident, 
   Chan is haunted by visions of that monk and a strange glowing symbol, 
   so when Chan spots that symbol on a temple when traveling by boat on 
   a river in Thailand, he enters the temple and finds out that he was 
   expected. A monk relates to Chan a story that happened a year 
   earlier, where the monk in Chan's visions battled a black magician 
   and lost. The monk was able to capture the black magician's spirit 
   (in the form of a bat) and drives a spike through its heart. This 
   only seems to piss-off the black magician, as we see him perform an 
   unbelievable ritual where he milks the vemon of cobras, mixes it with 
   the gooey brains of a human skull and feeds the mixture to three 
   spiders (who drink the fluid through straws!). The black magician 
   sneaks into the monk's sleeping quarters, defies gravity by climbing 
   the wall and crawling on the ceiling and drops the spid<A HREF="boxers_omen_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/boxer's omen vcd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ers
    onto the monk's eyes, where they inject him with the poison mixture, 
   killing him. It turns out that the monk was Chan's twin brother in a 
   previous life and Chan only has one year to live, unless he can come 
   up with a way to defeat the black magician and revert the poison eye 
   curse so his twin brother can become immortal. Are you with me so 
   far? Chan shaves his head and become a monk at the temple, learning 
   the mystic ways of Buddhism, sometimes the hard way (he takes a 
   meditative dip in a sacred pond and ends up covered with leeches!). 
   Eventually, Chan (who changes his name to Kaidi Baluo) becomes an 
   expert in Buddha magic and battles the black magician (in one of the 
   most outrageous sequences you will ever see), defeating him. Chan 
   then returns to his old life in Hong Kong, but his problems are far 
   from over. It seems the black magician has associates, who revive the 
   black magician (in the guise of a woman!) in a ritual that must be 
   seen to be believed. Too bad for Chan that a curse of poison 
   blindness is put on him in the middle of his bout with Ba Bo 
   (remember him?). Chan must return to Thailand, where he must do 
   battle against an evil unheard of until now, but first he must find a 
   thousand year-old mushroom which will give him the &quot;Essence of 
   Iron&quot;. Oh, no, this battle is going to be fierce, especially

   swear, I'm not making this shit up. It all ends in a temple in Nepal 
   that will have you not believing your eyes, ears or your basic mental 
   reasoning. Yeah, it's that good!&nbsp; A simple review could never do 
   this Hong Kong fantasy/horror film the justice it so richly deserves. 
   It should come as no surprise to learn that this was directed by Kuei 
   Chih Hung, who also gave us the demented classics <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BambooHouseDolls">BAMBOO

   (1981). This is not only a very weird film, it is also a 
   well-photographed one, with set designs and strange visuals that will 
   have you laughing out loud and watching with a sense of wonderment, 
   usually in the same scene (The walking bat skeleton and the slurping 
   spiders are so low-tech, they reach a new plateau of entertainment 
   and the final battle at the temple in Nepal, involving flying 
   skeleton hands, carnivorous caterpillars and a hungry giant 
   crocodile, is a thing of pure demented genius). There are some great 
   set-pieces here, particularly Chan's battles with the black magician, 
   such as when an army of bats rise out of the many crocodile skulls 
   that lay on the magician's floor. When Chan defeats the bats with a 
   spell of fire, the magician sends the snapping crocodile skulls in 
   Chan's direction and it only gets increasingly surreal as the battle 
   continues. There's entrail eating; a floating alien-like head with a 
   spinal column that snaps like a whip; body piercing; and the black 
   magician separating his head from his body and it flying through the 
   air trying to strangle Chan with the many red tentacles that shoot 
   from the neck. That's only the tip of the iceberg, as you will see a 
   magic ritual that involves gutting a large crocodile; some 
   full-frontal female nudity; a maggot-ridden corpse; a gag-inducing 
   scene of men regurgitating their food and passing it on to the next 
   person to eat; and bouts of martial arts action. <B><A HREF="boxers_omen_1983b.htm">THE

   I can guarantee you will never forget it. Christ, I haven't even 
   touched on the total body skin peeling; the strangest birthing scene 
   I have ever witnessed; and one-eyed creatures (that look like

   (When the midwife tries to cut the umbilical cord with a pair of

   - 1980), who tries to hide his superhuman powers (such as the ability 
   to split cords of wood with his bare hands) from the other 
   townspeople (Grandma is fully aware of his abilities). Granny tells 
   Roco the truth about his parents' deaths (It seems Robbie was in love 
   with Cora, but she chose his brother instead) and he vows to find 
   Robbie and kill him. Roco does have a serious Achilles' heel, though: 
   Whenever he comes in contact with water, he becomes weak and loses 
   all his powers (His grandmother tells him, &quot;Somehow you're like 
   a limestone. That is why when you get heated, you get harder and when 
   you get soaked in water, you begin to dissolve like the 'stone.&quot; 
   Well, there's one mystery solved!). It also seems that there is 
   something very sinister going on around the village. Not only are 
   there big hairy werewolf creatures on the loose, who are murdering 
   the local villagers at night, there is also an evil German scientist 
   that is pouring a poisonous chemical into the ocean, which is killing 
   all the fish. Of course, Roco gets embroiled in the entire mess when 
   he follows one of the werewolves into a house occupied by three 
   creepy spinsters. Roco accuses the spinsters of being werewolves, but 
   they just laugh and force him to have dinner with them. When Roco 
   sees that the meal being served is liver, he runs screaming out of 
   the house and is hit by a Jeep! The evil German scientist witnesses 
   the accident and notices that Roco is unharmed, so he orders his head 
   henchman, who just happens to be Robbie, to kidnap Roco so he can use 
   him in his illicit experiments. Meanwhile, the three spinsters, who 
   are really werewolves (there's an amazing stop-motion transformation 
   sequence that must be seen to be believed), and a vampire named 
   Captain Hugo (!) attack the village at night, terrorizing and killing 
   the townspeople (When the vampire, who looks like a flying monkey 
   from <B><A HREF="wizard_of_oz.htm">THE WIZARD OF OZ</A></B>, tries to 
   bite Roco on the leg, he breaks his teeth!). A series of 
   circumstances find Roco immobilized by water and being captured by 
   the spinsters. They strip him naked, bathe him, tie him to a spit and 
   begin roasting him over an open fire, not aware that heat only makes 
   him stronger. He breaks free and clobbers the werewolf spinsters, 
   only to be captured in flight by vampire Hugo. Roco breaks Hugo's 
   wings in mid-flight, only to be dropped in the ocean, where he is 
   saved by Valkan, a blind elder of a race of beings called the 
   Immortals. He teaches Roco how to control and harness his powers and 
   also tells Roco that he is the son of an Immortal. Valkan tells Roco 
   that he can visit his parents (his real father was the ghostly 
   Immortal who raped his mother in her sleep), but he must go on a long 
   journey to get there, which starts off with a visit to the Land Of

    People (Filipino midget alert!) and will also include a fight with a 
   giant cyclops, a pair of Siamese cavemen joined at the back (!), who 
   can separate at will, and a cave full of Shadow People who can shoot 
   laser beams out of their eyes. Eventually, Roco will meet his parents 
   again (alas, stepdad Isabello is not included in this package), but 
   he will also be captured by Robbie and the evil German scientist, who 
   we find out is responsible for the creation of the werewolves and the 
   vampire. I've only touched on the craziness on view here. Needless to 
   say, this is one film that is a must-see if you are a fan of Filipino 
   insanity.&nbsp; This outrageous fantasy, directed by J. Erastheo 
   Navoa (<B><A HREF="hepe_1980.htm">HEPE</A></B>, a.k.a. <B>THE CRAZY BUNCH</B> 
   - 1980; <B><A HREF="tatlo_silang_tatay_ko_1983.htm">TATLO SILANG 
   TATAY KO</A></B> - 1983) and written by Joeben Miraflor, is truly 
   mind-boggling; not only for the zany plot, characters and violence, 
   but also for the shameless way it puts a child in downright dangerous 
   situations. No amount of alcohol or drugs can ever wash away the 
   memory of watching the spinsters washing the nude body of actor Nino 
   Muhlach (the son of Executive Producer Alexander Muhlach and the 
   highest-paid child actor in Filipino film history, who had over 
   twenty films under his chubby little belt before he starred in this), 
   even if there's a well-placed flower in frame covering-up his naughty 
   bits or the sight of his nude body roasting over a fire (with his 
   naked ass prominently on display). It's just wrong for so many 
   reasons, but the low-rent makeup and special effects, which includes 
   cheap opticals, forced-perspective shots (especially during the 
   Cyclops attack) and dimestore werewolf and vampire costumes, will 
   have you roaring with laughter. Also amazingly hilarious are the 
   scenes where Roco rolls himself up into a ball and uses himself in a 
   game of werewolf bowling or the Arthurian Legend takeoff where Roco 
   goes to pull a sword out of a stone and ends up breaking it in two. 
   Nevermind that the actor playing the German scientist is obviously 
   played by a Filipino and just go with it, because it's a trip filled 
   with bloody violence (including a decapitation by a flying shield), 
   colorful characters and a storyline that crowded with ideas that the 
   meager budget can hardly afford to pull off. I put <B>BOY GOD</B> 
   (which is also known as <B><A HREF="stone_boy_1983.htm">STONE BOY</A></B>)
    on the same pedestal as <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Killing Satan">THE

   head out to Snake Worship Island in New Guinea; Wan Li to observe the

   said to be in possession of the legendary Snake Pearl) and Chin Sang 
   to observe the different styles of kung fu practiced there, 
   especially Snake Style kung fu. Their two guides lead them to the 
   Snake Tribe, but it is a long and arduous journey through the jungle 
   to get there. While Wan and Chin wait in the jungle, the two guides 
   head out to look for food and begin stealing bananas and and melons 
   from two clueless natives (played strictly for comical effect). That 
   night, Wan uses his kung fu skills to save a native girl being chased 
   by a group of natives, but the girl dies of snake poisoning after 
   telling Wan that she was to be used as a human sacrifice in a 
   ceremony performed by the Snake Tribe, who are now controlled by the

    The Great Wizard is the Master of Snake Style kung fu, as we see him 
   use his skills on his two best students (one of them portrayed by 
   Hong Kong regular Bolo Yeung [<B><A HREF="bloodsport_1988.htm">BLOODSPORT</A></B> 
   - 1988]). Wan and Chin meet fellow Chinaman Meh Cheng in the middle 
   of the jungle and he tells them that he is looking for the Snake 
   Pearl. When Wan and Chin tell him that they are not interested in the 
   object, Cheng doesn't believe them and tries to kill their two guides 
   (to slow down their progress), but Wan catches him in the act and 
   uses his superior kung fu skills to defeat Cheng, who retreats into 
   the jungle. Cheng is attacked by a large number of Devil Sect 
   members, but he manages to fight them off, only to run into the Grand 
   Wizard, who quickly defeats Cheng with his Snake Style kung fu and a 
   poison ring. Wan and Chin are next to fight the Devil Sect and they 
   split-up in the process and several months pass. Chin has returned 
   home and thinks than Wan is dead, but a year later Wan returns home a 
   changed man. It seems Wan had fallen in love with the Snake Tribe 
   Chief's beautiful daughter, Princess (Danna), but the Great Wizard 
   wants his idiot son to marry her so he can reap all the rewards and 
   riches the Snake Tribe possesses (including the Snake Pearl). Wan 
   tells his story to Chin (told in flashbacks) of how he fought the 
   Great Wizard and lost (that damned poison ring again), but he was 
   brought back from a certain death and nursed back to health by 
   Princess (who has a pet gorilla named Cheetah, who protects her with 
   his kung fu skills!) and they fall in love. A series of circumstances 
   force Wan to leave Snake Worship Island, but Princess slips him a 
   love potion that makes any other women who shows interest in him to 
   see nothing but snakes! Wan must return to the island to defeat the 
   Great Wizard and return to Princess, who has had Wan's baby, and it's 
   about to be sacrificed! Can Wan arrive in time?&nbsp; This ridiculous 
   martial arts fantasy, co-directed by C.Y. Yang and Kong Hung (better

   of a cheesy Hong Kong kung fu flick of the 70's: Laughable English 
   dubbing (&quot;Princess, you are a slut!&quot;); exaggerated sound 
   effects during the fight scenes; a music soundtrack full of stolen 
   cues; and plenty of camera zooms. This film also has a guy in the 
   chintziest gorilla suit you will ever see performing kung fu moves; 
   some fantasy elements (what exactly is the importance of the Snake 
   Pearl is never made clear); the late addition of an overweight white 
   adventurer (Alan Ellerton) and his black sidekick (who sets race 
   relations back fifty years with a single line of dialogue!); and a 
   pit of poisonous snakes. All of this adds-up to one enjoyably nutty 
   viewing experience that, while lacking in bloody violence, still 
   manages to entertain with its plentiful fight scenes and off-the-wall 
   storyline. It's one part martial arts flick, one part jungle 
   adventure and one part fantasy. What more could you want? Also 
   starring Chen Yen Chun, Lee Hoi San, Shan Mao and Lin Yang Yang.

    KILLER SNAKES</A></B> (1974) is the ultimate Hong Kong snake film, 
   wait until you get a look at this piece of work. In the first few 
   minutes alone, dozens of live snakes are graphically killed 
   on-screen, proving once again that Chinese filmmakers have no regard 
   for reptile life as long as it looks good on film. The story is 
   simple: On a new constriction site, the workers unearth a huge nest 
   of snakes. Rather than relocate the snakes to a new location, the 
   crooked construction company owner, Mr. Chang, orders his workers to 
   kill all the snakes (he personally operates the crane to chop up the 
   snakes into little pieces as they are helpless in the pit, while his 
   workers kill all the escapees with picks and shovels, all in loving 
   close-ups), disregarding his religious wife's dire warning that the 
   snakes will get their revenge. He should have listened to his wife. 
   When a highrise apartment complex is finished on the construction 
   site, a series of snake attacks begin to plague the building, causing 
   many deaths and nothing but headaches for Mr. Chang, who tries to 
   cover-up the snake problems any way he can. Only the building's 
   architect, Shu Cheng Fang, seems bothered about the sudden appearance 
   of the snakes, as the curse seems to be real because the snakes 
   (whose leader is a big-ass boa constrictor) not only attack people in 
   the apartment building, they also assault the dormitory housing the 
   construction workers several blocks away and kill many of the workers 
   in a ma<A HREF="calamity_of_snakes_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/calamity of snakes japanese poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ss
    attack. Shu Cheng Fang comes to the conclusion that if the leader of 
   the snakes is killed, the problem will be solved, so he hires snake 
   expert Master Lin (who puts on a show where he lets snakes bite his 
   tongue!) to capture and kill the giant boa constrictor. After losing 
   a couple of fingers due to the boa's wrath (it's quite the 
   spectacle), Master Lin kills the boa by hanging it on a noose. 
   Thinking that their snake problem is over, Mr. Chang throws a huge 
   party at the apartment building, where the new tenants and potential 
   investors for future projects are in attendance. Before you can say, 
   &quot;Man speaks with forked tongue&quot;, a huge amount of snakes 
   (and I do mean huge) lay siege to the building. Nearly everyone dies 
   before the police send men in with flamethrowers. The snakes get the 
   final revenge when the giant boa puts in another appearance and coils 
   it's flaming body around Mr. Chang, causing him to burst into flames. 
   That'll teach him!&nbsp; This is a film that is sure to give PETA and 
   other animal rights activists conniption fits, as there are many 
   disturbing scenes of snakes being killed in every way imaginable 
   (including the removal of a live snake's gall bladder, supposedly an 
   aphrodisiac, just like in <B>THE KILLER SNAKES</B>) and a lengthy 
   sequence where several mongooses (mongeese?) are set loose to attack 
   and kill a room full of cobras. None of it is very pretty and, while 
   I would never condone live animal slaughter on film as a medium for 
   entertainment, I must confess that I found some of the scenes 
   fascinating and hypnotic in a sadistic sort of way. Director William 
   Cheung Kei (<B><A HREF="heroes_of_the_wild_1977.htm">HEROES OF THE WILD</A></B> 
   - 1977), who takes the name &quot;William Chang Kee&quot; here and 
   co-wrote the screenplay with Chrile Lee Hang Leng, revels in the 
   scenes of the snakes' demises, but he also gives them the chance to 
   inflict pain on the cast (some of it looks very real) before they are 
   dispatched. Here, they don't just slither, they also fly through the 
   air, possess superhuman strength and, at one point, break all the 
   windows of a car to get to their prey. If you have aversions to 
   snakes, believe me when I say that this is not the film for you. 
   Snakes attack people in elevators, in their beds, while playing Mah 
   Jong, taking a bath and one lady in her wheelchair is attacked while 
   knitting. There is nothing here left to the imagination and I give 
   the actors a lot of respect for being willing to fall face-first and 
   roll around in what are obviously piles of real snakes. Director 
   Cheung Kei also tosses in some comedy (especially between Mr. Chang's 
   assistant and an obese female tenant) and uses slow-motion 
   photography to good effect, such as Master Lin's battle with the 
   giant boa and the finale, where Mr. Chang swings a sword while hordes 
   of snakes fly through the air in his direction. <B>CALAMITY OF SNAKES</B>

   on the disappearance or how he found his way back home.&quot;</FONT></B> 
   So what really happened? That's the main crux of the film, that is, 
   until the film veers off into territory so weird, you will think you 
   are watching another entirely different film. But don't worry, the 
   film then regains its traction and takes us on a journey into the unknown.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anjelica is worried about Andres' condition, thinking he is going 
   insane (he has nightmares about a shark chasing him), but his doctor 
   (Nino Segurini; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondTheDoor1974">BEYOND
    THE DOOR</A></B> - 1974) tells her that it is normal for someone in 
   Andres' condition and he should rapidly improve. The Police 
   Commissioner (Sergio Doria; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH
    SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973) is questioning Andres in his 
   hospital room, saying to Andres that he doesn't expect him to believe 
   that he was floating in the ocean for six months, but Andres says the 
   past six months are blank in his mind, he has no memory of what 
   happened to him, the crew or the White Shark. The Commissioner 
   reminds Andres that a group of American specialists hired him six 
   months ago to assist them in some oceanic graphic studies (whatever 
   that is), but Andres still insists he has no memory of it. The 
   Commissioner tells him to think harder (That's not how amnesia 
   works!), further reminding him that the White Shark had six days of 
   normal sailing, but then something went wrong, insisting that Andres 
   tell him what that &quot;something&quot; was. He continues with the 
   ship's radio signals stopped and the White Shark just up and 
   disappeared without a trace and for no known reason. The Commissioner 
   finds it hard to believe that Andres can't remember a single incident 
   leading up to this, not even a warning that something was going 
   wrong, but Andres insists that he can't remember anything. The 
   Commissioner says, &quot;Very well, I can be patient...for the 
   moment&quot; and then asks Ricardo to walk him out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A few days later, Ricardo tells Anjelica that Andres will be 
   released from the hospital soon and wants to know what she is going 
   to do. She tells Ricardo that she will be by Andres' side, taking 
   care of him. Ricardo says that she must sympathize with his brother, 
   asking her, &quot;Or is there some other reason? He wants you to 
   marry him. Do you still love him?&quot; Anjelica says, &quot;I wish I 
   knew. I suffered so much when he was given up for dead. For a long 
   time I couldn't face having to live without him. You were the only 
   person to help me.&quot; Okay, I thing we all can see where this is 
   heading. Ricardo professes his love for Anjelica and she says she 
   knew he fell in love with her and she began feeling the same way, but 
   Andres has come back and he is very ill mentally, so they can't think 
   about themselves when Andres needs the both of them. Anjelica doesn't 
   want Andres to suffer because of what happened between them. Ricardo 
   tells her to quit living in the past, but he won't try to stop her. 
   Whatever she wants, he wants, too. Hey, ever hear the story of Cain 
   and Abel? As the doctor is releasing Andres from the hospital, Andres 
   asks if he will ever regain his memory. The doctor tells him that it 
   will be better for his mental health if he never remembered what 
   happened, but he'll probably remember the whole story one of these 
   days. The doctor tells him to take a holiday with his girl and let 
   things come naturally and that's just what he does, but with Ricardo 
   tagging along as extra baggage. Every time Andres and Anjelica kiss 
   or get intimate, a look of anger and jealousy takes over Ricardo's face.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film then takes a drastic turn into Weirdsville when we see a 
   man in a trenchcoat and sunglasses (Oscar Alvarez), handing a metal 
   box and a wad of cash to two men in an airport. We then see the two 
   men piloting a small prop plane over the ocean (and in the Bermuda 
   Triangle), when they discover that they are mysteriously off course. 
   They try to get back on course, but they can't control the plane; 
   it's like something else has taken over control. They notice a 
   strange bright light below them, as if it is coming from the ocean 
   floor. We then learn that this is an unauthorized flight, yet the two 
   men contact the control tower to announce a mayday. The control tower 
   asks their position, but neither of them know where they are, as all 
   the plane's controls are going haywire. The plane then crashes into 
   the ocean, right where the bright light is emitting, as the ocean 
   water bubbles, as if it is boiling. We then see the trenchcoat man 
   phoning Mr. Jackson (Arthur Kennedy; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Let Sleeping Corpse">LET
    SLEEPING CORPSES LIE</A></B> - 1974), telling him that the plane 
   carrying the metal box went down in the ocean and they have to 
   somehow locate and salvage the plane, because &quot;the box&quot; 
   must be found or &quot;You'll know what they will do.&quot; Jackson 
   tells him that he will take care of it, he knows the right people to 
   salvage the plane and he will make sure they keep quiet and not 
   tip-off the competition. What the fuck is going on here? What does 
   'the box&quot; have to do with anything and why is it so important? 
   We get answers to one of the questions, but the other question is 
   leaves us hanging long after the film ends!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Jackson at a dock, talking to frogman Enrique (Pino 
   Colizzi; <B><A HREF="brothers_till_we_die_1978.htm">BROTHERS TILL WE DIE</A></B> 
   - 1978), offering him and his partner, Andres (!), $15,000 to salvage 
   the plane, but Enrique&nbsp; tells Jackson he will need two days to 
   make up his mind (He quickly says yes when Jackson offers him the use 
   of a helicopter to locate the plane by air). Enrique spots the plane 
   lying intact on the ocean floor, so he, Andres and Jackson take a 
   boat to the location. Enrique and Andres, in full scuba gear,&nbsp; 
   dive into the ocean, unaware what they are about to discover. They 
   find a cave full of sharks, but they are all sleeping and under the 
   control of the bright light. They are chased away by one fully awake 
   shark (the same shark that Andres is having nightmares about) and 
   when they surface, they tell Jackson that they were unable to locate 
   the plane because they were scared of waking up the sleeping sharks. 
   They tell Jackson that sharks never sleep like that because they must 
   keep moving; if they stop, they die (this is true). Jackson couldn't 
   be more uninterested, asking about the plane. Enrique says that they 
   will do another dive tomorrow morning, but Andres refuses, saying 
   what he saw down there scared him and it may have something to do 
   with his missing six months. As you can probably guess, things don't 
   go swimmingly (pardon the pun). We then watch a bunch of hippies on a 
   boat, one playing the guitar and singing (a really awful) ballad, 
   while a young hippie woman (Cinzia Monreale; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#SilverSaddle1978">SILVER
    SADDLE</A></B> - 1978) plays with tarot cards and the final card she 
   turns over is the (gasp!) Death card. A young hippie girl, who is 
   carrying a doll with a cracked, deformed face (!), walks outside the 
   cabin, where she sees the bright light emitting from the ocean floor. 
   She then jumps in the water and drowns, not even putting up a fight 
   and soon all the other hippies do the same thing, their 
   expressionless faces looking like they are in a trance and being 
   controlled by the bright light. We watch their bodies sink to the 
   bottom, and in a truly WTF?!? scene, we see the deformed doll slowly 
   sinking, too, blood gushing out of its mouth!&nbsp; The boat then 
   lifts anchor and travels away all on its own, a true ghost ship. The 
   hippies that do snap out of their trance are then devoured by sharks!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, Enrique and Andres (who apparently changed his 
   mind) dive into the ocean to look for the plane, swimming through the 
   cave of the sharks to get to it. In the plane, they find the 
   co-pilot, who is nothing but a decaying corpse with a cloudy intact 
   eyeball in its left eyesocket. Enrique finds the metal box and, as 
   they travel back through the cave, they discover that the sharks are 
   no longer there. Andres shows Jackson that he has the box, but he and 
   Enrique suddenly jump overboard, Enrique thinking the box is worth 
   more then the $15,000 Jackson is paying them. Andres drops the box 
   when he hits the water, but before he can retrieve it, he discovers a 
   huge graveyard of ships (obvious models) from all centuries on the 
   ocean floor and then sees Enrique being sucked into the cave&nbsp; by 
   a mysterious, powerful force. Andres surfaces, only for Jackson to 
   try and run him over with the boat. When he is unable to do so, 
   Jackson uses a pistol and shoots Andres in the back, seriously 
   injuring him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the hospital, but not hurt badly (he needs crutches to walk), 
   Andres tells Anjelica that he must go back to the luminous cave, as 
   he believes Enrique may be alive, but his injuries won't allow him to 
   dive. He also tells Anjelica that he believes the&nbsp; cave may have 
   something to do with the missing six months he has no memory of. 
   Jackson and some goons try to kidnap Andres so he can take them to 
   the box, but he escapes. He's even more determined to find Enrique 
   and get his memory back, even though Anjelica keeps telling him that 
   he is wrong (She's so negative, I wanted to kick her in her lady 
   parts!). Andres talks to an elderly fisherman, who tells him about 
   his experiences with the bright light (cue the flashback), but he 
   tells Andres that he has no memory of what happened next after seeing 
   the light. For some reason (probably because of Andres' injuries), 
   Miss Negativity wants to dive alone to the cave to see if she can 
   find Enrique, so Andres lets her (It would be a perfect time for him 
   to fill her oxygen tank with carbon monoxide!). Anjelica makes the 
   dive and takes some photos with her camera. When she develops the 
   photos, she can see Enrique standing on the ocean floor, apparently 
   alive, but then his image disappears from the photo. Finally seeing 
   the light (pardon the pun), Anjelica makes a second dive, while 
   Andres and Ricardo wait topside on the boat, when Jackson appears, 
   gun drawn. Ricardo kills him with his gun, unaware that Jackson has 
   sent some divers to kill Anjelica. When Andres realizes what is 
   happening, he suits-up, dives into the water and kills all the 
   frogmen with his speargun. Anjelica discovers a world of wonders on 
   the ocean floor, such as pyramids and even an entire<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cave of the sharks dutch vhs front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0">

   saving his true love by snapping all the sharks out of sleep mode? 
   Believe me when I tell you this: There is no way in Hell you will 
   guess how this film ends.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even though there are no answers to some important questions, such 
   as why the box is so important&nbsp; or what happened to Andres and 
   the crew of the White Shark six months earlier, director Tonino Ricci (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Panic 1976">PANIC</A></B> 
   - 1982; <B><A HREF="#ThorConqueror83">THOR THE CONQUEROR</A></B> - 
   1983; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Raiders Magic Ivory">RAIDERS OF THE 
   MAGIC IVORY</A></B> - 1988) makes this entertaining nonsense just for 
   the fact that these questions remain unanswered, leaving it up to us 
   to decide what those answers are. This film avoids logic like the 
   plague and while not much goes on for the entire running time, it 
   still makes this film an entertaining piece of fantasy, if only for 
   the strange scenes herein, such as the doll that bleeds from the 
   mouth and the sight of sharks sleeping (How did they manage to do 
   this? It's obvious that these are real sharks, but they never remain 
   still like they do in this film. It's not freezing the frame that is 
   done here, as it is easy to see other things moving in the frame.), 
   so I can do nothing but give Ricci props for giving us even more 
   unanswered questions to go along with the film's many head-scratching 
   scenes. The screenplay, by Ricci, Fernando Galiana and Mauricio 
   Melchiorre, is pure cheese all the way, but the story is helped 
   immensely by the late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#StelvioCipriani">Stelvio
    Cipriani</A>'s haunting music score, which goes along quite well 
   with the mysteries the oceans hide. There's not much meat on the bone 
   here, but what is here makes for a delicious little snack, not too 
   filling, but still tasty. Nothing more, nothing less. I enjoyed it 
   and as long as you don't put on your thinking caps, you should, too.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (here using the name &quot;Ted Kingsbrook&quot;). It was also written 
   by Ho (as &quot;Leo Beckman&quot;) and it's apparent to see that he 
   was tripping on some hallucinogenic when he came up with the plot for 
   this film. The majority of the film is footage from the Thailand 
   fantasy film <B><A HREF="krai_thong_2_1985.htm">KRAI THONG II</A></B> 
   (1985), but Ho adds a subplot<A HREF="crocodile_fury_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/crocodile fury poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   imagine the Australian dubbers laughing hysterically between takes at 
   the absurdity of it all, but that is what makes this film so 
   entertaining. It turns out that the film proper footage is just as 
   crazy as Ho's new footage, making this film one wild, crazy ride for viewers.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with new footage, as Vampire Witch Monica (Trudy 
   Calder) summons hopping vampires to kill American mercenary Bruce 
   (Kent Wills, as &quot;Nick Reece&quot;; Ho's <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Robo Vampire">ROBO
    VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1988) and his team who are in-country to kill the 
   Witch's Master, Cooper (actor unknown), the &quot;Master Of The Sea 
   World.&quot; Monica flails her hands wildy, invoking the vampires by 
   repeating &quot;Make it clear, clear I say!&quot;, followed by her 
   best impression of Ralph Kramden, chanting &quot;Ba-ba-ba-ba- Humina, 
   humina, humina, humina!&quot; We then see Bruce and his mercenary 
   team fighting the vampires, Bruce losing all of his team, but 
   defeating them all, much to the Vampire Witch's consternation and 
   surprise. We then switch to the film proper, as we see a giant 
   crocodile swimming in a river, devouring every native villager it 
   comes in contact with (The crocodile can also fly and jump straight 
   up in the air, swallowing villagers who are hiding in trees!). 
   Villager Jack Thompson (Sorapong Chatree; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#EyesOfTheCondor">EYES
    OF THE CONDOR</A></B> - 1987), who is married to Peggy (Supansa 
   Nuengpirom), recognizes the crocodile as his former love Maria 
   (Aranya Namwong), whom Cooper&nbsp; cursed, turning her into the 
   Crocodile Queen (It makes as much sense as naming a native villager 
   &quot;Jack Thompson&quot;!). Jack begs Maria to stop eating villagers 
   or he won't love her any more (I wonder what Peggy thinks of 
   this?!?), so Maria reverts to her human form, pissing off Master 
   Cooper, who creates a Crococile King from a villager named Steven 
   (Sombat Matanee; <B><A HREF="action.htm#TigerFighting1976">TIGER FIGHTING</A></B> 
   - 1976) to kidnap Peggy and bring her back to his undersea hideout. 
   To makes sure Steve is successful in his task, Master Cooper gives 
   him diamond crocodile teeth (one look at his grill and you will be 
   rolling on the floor!). Long story short, Steven is successful and 
   brings Peggy back to the hideout, where crocodile man Don (Sun Chien; <B><A HREF="#HumanLanterns">HUMAN
    LANTERNS</A></B> - 1982) sexually assaults Peggy in his human form 
   with Master Cooper's blessing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    With a wizard's help, Jack creates a magic weapon (a sword) that 
   will rid the village of crocodiles, after Steven, in crocodile form, 
   attacks the village, eating as many people as possible in the film's 
   bloodiest sequence (It is obvious that real amputees were used as the 
   crocodile's victims, as we see legs and arms bitten off and see the 
   victims with bloody stumps, filmed in such a way as leaving no doubt 
   that no special effects of any type were used in the attacks, except 
   adding blood and shreds of meat to the amputee's stumps!). With his 
   new weapon, Jack enters Master Cooper's hideout and when he sees 
   Peggy bloody and bruised, he accuses Don of rape. In what can best be 
   described as the film's most delirious moment, Don says to him, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I
    didn't rape her. I may have taken some liberties, but I didn't rape 
   her! Even crocodiles have their honor!&quot;</FONT></B> (Wow, just 
   wow.).&nbsp; Don and Jack then get into a martial art fight, where 
   Jack is seriously wounded with a spear. Don then attacks him with his 
   crocodile powers, turning Jack into a crocodile. During this rukus, 
   Maria takes Peggy back to the village alive, surprising Jack (Who is 
   no longer a crocodile. It's apparent that some footage was excised 
   from the film proper to accomodate Ho's new footage). The film proper 
   ends with Jack killing all the cursed crocodiles with the power of 
   prayer! (WTF?!?)</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In Ho's new footage, which interrupts the film every fifteen minutes 
   or so, we see Bruce battling Monica's<A HREF="crocodile_fury_1988.htm#SorceressOfDeep"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/crocodile fury aka sorceress of the deep poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   hopping vampires and zombies (yes, zombies are also in this film!) 
   and winning. Monica also picks up a new helper called Rudy (Ernst 
   Mausser; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#SeventhCurse1986">THE 
   SEVENTH CURSE</A></B> - 1986), a fedora-wearing wannabe wizard, who 
   we first see puking up maggots and worms when he discovers the bloody 
   remains of Bruce's victims. The finale comes when Monica sends more 
   vampires and zombies to kill Bruce when he discovers her hideout, but 
   Bruce kills them all with flaming playing cards! Monica attacks Bruce 
   with her Freddy Krueger-like metal fingernails, but Bruce slices her 
   stomach open and a flying head-like monster comes flying out of the 
   wound. After Bruce kills it, he slaps the handcuffs on Monica and 
   tells her she is under arrest (What?!?). Rudy then attacks, but Bruce 
   kills him with a throwing knife to his head. When Bruce turns around, 
   his handcuffs are empty. THE END (using the same red card Ho uses on 
   all his other pastiche films).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There are so many hilarious scenes in this film, it's near 
   impossible to list them all. The crocodile suit, which is obviously 
   worn by a human walking on all fours, is just so crazy, you'll be 
   amazed by its movements, especially the way it flies out of the water 
   over a boat full of villagers. What astounded me the most is that 
   even though the villagers know there's a deadly crocodile in the 
   river, most of them still go for a swim and then become devoured, as 
   we see the crocodile swimming with bodies in its mouth. You cannot 
   escape the crocodile, even on dry land, as it has the ability to jump 
   high in the air, picking off villagers hiding in trees or crashing 
   through the top of huts as villagers hide on the roof. There's 
   nothing this crocodile can't do! In one of the films more weird 
   sequences, the villagers hire a crocodile hunter who is a fraud; he 
   appears with a talking skeleton (!), who lauds the crocodile hunter 
   as he touts how good he is, daring the villagers to doubt him by 
   saying, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Is what the skeleton saying to us 
   true or is he lying to us?&quot;</FONT></B> Of course, when he sees 
   the crocodile, he beats a hasty retreat, only for the crocodile to 
   make a tasty meal out of him. In Godfrey Ho's canon of cut-and-paste 
   films (and there are dozens, if not hundreds, of them), this one is 
   probably his craziest. And that's saying a mouthful! Also known as <B><A HREF="crocodile_fury_1988.htm#SorceressOfDeep">SORCERESS

   A group of nuns collect the pieces, putting each piece in its own 
   wooden box laden with religious symbols and hiding those boxes in the 
   catacombs beneath their convent. Are the nuns hiding the pieces so 
   the amulet can never be whole again or is there another reason?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Twenty years pass and Londoner Elizabeth (Louise Salter) is going to 
   the island after getting a letter from her friend, a nun named 
   Theresa, saying to come to the island because she misses her friend, 
   but warns Elizabeth that the island is like living in the Middle 
   Ages, as there are no cars, telephones or even electricity, none of 
   the modern convienences she might expect in the latter part of the 
   20th Century. Elizabeth's father has recently passed away and she 
   discovers that he was giving the convent on the island a huge yearly 
   stipend, so Elizabeth has two reasaons to go to the island: to see 
   Theresa and try to find out why her father was sending the convent 
   huge amounts of money for the past twenty years. Elizabeth inherited 
   her father's fortune and hopes to discover the reason why her father 
   was secretly sending the convent money and if she will continue doing 
   it. While Elizabeth is traveling to the island, we watch the nuns 
   gather together in the catacombs for a round of self-flagellation. 
   Theresa (Anna Rose Phipps) accidentally finds one of the boxes 
   containing a piece of the amulet, but a robed figure stabs her over 
   and over with a dagger, killing her. The nuns continue chanting, as 
   Theresa's bloody body falls near them, her blood mixing with the 
   constantly flowing water and covering a painting of a crucified Jesus Christ.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Elizabeth gets to the mainland, she tries to find 
   transportation to the island, first from a fisherman (Valeriy 
   Bassel), who refuses to take her there today, but tells her he will 
   take her there next week, no charge. When Elizabeth tells him she 
   needs to go to the island immediately, he asks her, &quot;Are you 
   afraid of death?&quot; A boat captain (Pavel Sokolov) offers to take 
   her to the island right now, asking for a large sum of money which 
   Elizabeth pays. While traveling to the island in the pouring rain, 
   she sees a creepy deckhand eating recently caught fish raw, am insane 
   look on his face and he rips apart the fish with his teeth. The boat 
   captain says to Elizabeth, &quot;Don't mind him. He keeps the other 
   freaks away.&quot; Once on the island, young nun Sarah (Venera 
   Simmons) greets Elizabeth, takes her to the convent and shows her the 
   room she will be staying in. It is small and bare, with no 
   electricity and no plumbing, but the sound of running water can be 
   heard throughout the convent, as it doesn't ever seem to stop 
   raining. Sarah tells Elizabeth that one day she hopes to visit London 
   and Elizabeth says, &quot;England? Why? You'd hate it, Sarah.&quot; 
   We then learn that Elizabeth's mother was born on this island, 
   telling Sarah, &quot;She died giving birth to me.&quot; She also 
   tells Sarah that her father spent most of his life trying to forget 
   about this island. So why was he giving the convent a very healthy 
   yearly payment? Elizabeth is determined to get to the bottom of the 
   matter, but it just may be the death of her, or worse.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The convent's old, blind (and ugly!) Mother Superior (Mariya 
   Kapnist) agrees to talk to Elizabeth, but it's Mother Superior's 
   Assistant (Lubov Snegur) who does all the talking because Mother 
   Superior can't really talk; she just croaks and grunts, but her 
   Assistant seems to understand what she is saying, acting like her 
   translator. Elizabeth wants to know why her father was so secretive 
   about the yearly donations and why he suddenly converted to religion 
   since he spent most of his life an athiest. The Mother Superior 
   croaks something and the Assistant says, &quot;Sometimes secrecy is a 
   blessing. We are a very secretive order, Elizabeth. We don't allow 
   the corruption of the outside world to divert us from our divine 
   purpose.&quot; Elizabeth asks if money counts as a corrupting factor 
   and Mother Superior grunts something unintelligible and the Assistant 
   says, &quot;There's such a thing as a necessary evil, my child. 
   Unfortunately, there are things not solved by prayer alone.&quot; 
   Elizabeth appreciates that statement, but she wants to know why she 
   should carry on with the payments. Neither Mother Superior or the 
   Assistant say anything; Mother Superior plays with her rosary beads 
   and the Assistant holds the wooden cross around her neck. After a 
   short while, the Mother Superior croaks something and the Assistant 
   says, &quot;They serve a purpose, Elizabeth. Your father understood 
   that and I trust you will, too, in time. In the meantime, I will do 
   all I can to help you.&quot; (as long as that &quot;help&quot; 
   doesn't involve telling her what the money is for!). She gives 
   Elizabeth free access to the convent's extensive library, their 
   ceremonies and everything that the convent has to offer. She also 
   appoints Sarah to be Elizabeth's assistant, telling Elizabeth that 
   Sarah will make a &quot;willing&quot; assistant.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The rules of the convent state that Elizabeth is not allowed any 
   personal belongings while she is there and she has to wear what is 
   basically a burlap sack while she is in the convent. Sarah hands 
   Elizabeth a letter from Theresa, saying Theresa left the convent a 
   couple of days ago to go to London. Elizabeth knows this is a lie 
   based on Theresa's previous letter. Elizabeth finds a book in the 
   convent's library that has a deawing of a tentacled creature and the 
   text underneath it reads: <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;The beast that 
   thou sawest was and is not, and they that dwell on the Earth shall 
   wonder when they behold the beast that was and is not, and yet is. 
   And they shall make an image of the beast, for the whole of the image 
   shall make the beast ascend out of the bottomless pit. And power will 
   be given unto the beast. and all, both small and great, rich and 
   poor, free and bond, that sawest the face of the beast shall receive 
   a mark, the mark of blindness that is and yet is not. For those who 
   are blind shall see the true face of the beast and forever suffer it 
   in their soul. The beast shall say unto the world, 'I am alpha and

    and death.'&quot;</FONT></B> Elizabeth then hears faint voices and 
   sees nuns carrying a bloody dead body. she follows them and finds the 
   area where Thereas was killed; a pit occupied by a blind man called 
   &quot;the Painter&quot;, who paints artwork on the pit's walls (and 
   canvas), one of them depicting Theresa's murder. She tells Sarah what 
   she saw and says she is sure the nuns murdered Theresa. Sarah seems 
   genuinely surprised, telling Elizabeth they should try to discover 
   the truth. Let me sum up the film in the following two paragraphs...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While in the convent, Elizabth has dreams about two young girls 
   playing in the convent and holdong the amulet, offering it to some 
   unknown person. We are led to believe it is a young Elizabeth and 
   Theresa, but we will soon discover that we were very, very wrong. 
   Dead wrong. When Elizabeth actually discovers Theresa is dead (she 
   gives the island's lazy postmaster [also the village butcher] a bribe 
   and finds a letter from Theresa to her, telling Elizabeth not to come 
   to the island because something is not right here), the nuns make 
   several attempts on Theresa's life (strangulation by chain, stabbing 
   and setting her on fire), but she manages to escape them all. She 
   becomes scared and attempts to leave the convent, but the ship that 
   would take her back to the mainland left a couple of minutes ago and 
   won't be back until next week. She meets an old blind woman, who 
   knows Elizabeth under a different name, but before she can learn 
   more, the nuns invade the old woman's house and toss a flaming cross 
   inside, burning the old woman to death. Elizabeth then learns that 
   her mother isn't dead at all and that Mom's not human and neither is 
   the sister she never knew she had...Sarah! (Wait until&nbsp; you see 
   Sarah when she removes her habit!). Her mother lives in the catacombs 
   beneath the convent, where the nuns pray to her. Those that see her 
   image go instantly blind, so why do the nuns pray to her?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It turns out the nuns weren't trying to hide the pieces of the 
   amulet, they were actually trying to find every single piece for the 
   past twenty years so they could put it back together. They now have 
   all the pieces and a ritual is about to take place. They weren't 
   praying to God or<A HREF="dark_waters_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dark waters 1993 aka dead waters vhs front1a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Jesus at all, they were praying to a tentacled creature from Hell. 
   Why do they pray to this creature? So they could summon it and create 
   a Hell on Earth. (All the clues are in the book quotation above). So, 
   does Elizabeth survive this? I'm afraid her fate isn't a happy one; 
   it's actually a fate worse than death, but I'll leave that for you to 
   discover (I will tell you this: She goes blind).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's no surprise that this film has many Lovecraftian touches, as 
   this Russia/United kingsom/Italy co-production was directed by 
   Italian Mariano Baino, his only feature film (he directed numerous 
   shorts that also have Lovecraftian touches), as he is a huge fan of 
   H.P. Lovecraft. This film is very loosely based on Lovecraft's 
   &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot;, but the finale is straight out 
   of &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (fans of Lovecraft's stories will 
   know what I mean since, if I say any more, it will give away the 
   film's finale). This is a fantastic film to look at, thanks to 
   cinematographer Alex Howe (<B><A HREF="woman_in_black_2012.htm">THE 
   WOMAN IN BLACK</A></B> - 2012), who filmed this in many real 
   locations in Ukraine, including the peninsula of Crimea and the 
   Odessa Catacombs, giving each location a feel that death is around 
   every corner. Water also plays an important role in this film, as it 
   permeates nearly every frame of film. If we don't see water, we hear 
   it, giving the film a very eerie vibe. It's almost as if water is a 
   character, a very uncomfortable character for the viewer. While not a 
   classic (I'm not a huge nunsploitation fan, as readers of this site 
   know, and Baino and Andrew D. Bark's sceeenplay is a little too 
   slowly paced, taking its time in the revelations department), it's 
   still a beautiful, atmospheric feast for the eyes and gets a 
   recommendation from me. Fans of Lovecraft are bound to dig it, as are 
   those looking for something different to watch on a rainy night. This 
   film is ideal under those circumstances.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Holy fuck! This is one truly terrible film. So terrible, in fact, 
   that it could quite possibly be one of the most unintentionally 
   entertaining movies ever made. On a post-nuke Earth, the world is 
   ruled by evil warlord Baktar (Kenneth Peerless, here using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Kenneth Peer&quot;), who stages gladiator fights in a 
   miniature Thunderdome-style arena. Running out of fresh food and 
   water, not to mention everyone is slowly dying of radiation poisoning 
   (Baktar's attempt at getting women pregnant results in mutant 
   babies), Baktar sends out his top warrior, Zerak (Lou Ferrigno, who 
   isn't dubbed), to search for a woman who is not contaminated by 
   radiation. That woman happens to be Racela (Shari Shattuck; <B><A HREF="naked_cage_1985.htm">THE
    NAKED CAGE</A></B> - 1985), who is a member of an advanced race of 
   humans called The Drones, who have lived underground since the 
   nuclear bombs fell and therefore are radiation-free. Racela grows 
   tired of living in caves and comes to the surface without permission 
   to blow-off some steam. She is promptly captured by a tribe of mutant 
   ninjas (!), but is soon saved by Zerak. As soon as their eyes meet 
   (well, in Zerak's case, eye, since he wears a black patch over his 
   radiation-scarred left eye), it's love at first sight. Meanwhile, 
   Racela's father, Cortaz (Anthony East; <B><A HREF="action.htm#FastGun">FAST
    GUN</A></B> - 1987), obtains permission from the Drones president, 
   Antarius (Mike Cohen), to go to the surface to look for his daughter, 
   but he is warned that if he decides to return to the Drones society, 
   he and everyone he brings back will be executed <A HREF="desert_warrior_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/desert warrior vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(they
    don't want to be contaminated with radiation). As Racela tends to 
   Zerak's battle wounds and nurses him back to health, Cortaz and his 
   group of laser pistol-equipped soldiers begin the search for Racela, 
   first running up against a tribe of mutant pygmies and then battling 
   a tribe of radiation-scarred spear-chuckers. Racela and Zerak trek on 
   foot through the blazing hot desert and just when it seems all hope 
   is lost, they are rescued by Baktar, who plans to mate with Racela 
   and bear normal children (Never mind that Baktar is contaminated. 
   It's best not to dwell on those plot points.). This doesn't sit too 
   well with Zerak, who reunites Racela with her father and send them on 
   their way. Racela refuses to leave Zerak behind, so she steals one of 
   her father's bubble-domed dune buggies and heads back to Baktar's 
   village to free an imprisoned Zerak. She brings Zerak back to Drones 
   headquarters, not aware of the death sentence imposed on all 
   returnees, but they are both saved by Drones scientist Dr. Crea (Mike 
   Monty), who has developed a serum that reverses radiation poisoning 
   (He first uses it on Zerak and we watch as his mutant left eye 
   returns to normal). Trouble ensues when Baktar and his men show up at 
   the Drones' front door and a battle breaks out. Zerak then does 
   something so fucking unrealistic to end the fight that I had to 
   rewind the tape just to make sure I wasn't halucinating. I 
   wasn't.&nbsp; I have the feeling that we're either dealing with a 
   demented genius or a clueless idiot in one-time director Jim Goldman. 
   This Philippines-lensed film, produced by Hong Kong's Silver Star 
   Film Company, is so poorly made and badly acted (Ferrigno has never 
   been worse than he is here), I'm beginning to believe that Jim 
   Goldman (who has no other credits in the motion picture industry) is 
   actually a pseudonym for a Filipino director (Willie Milan [<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#ClashOfTheWarlords">CLASH
    OF THE WARLORDS</A></B> - 1985] would be my best guess). The film is 
   full of many badly-staged action scenes, where the stuntmen can 
   plainly be seen anticipating the explosions around them (yet they 
   still are a good microsecond or two late in jumping in the air!) and 
   laser gun battles where the optically added laser beams hit many 
   people but they don't react. This flick is hilarious for it's many 
   distractions, from the flubbed lines (no second takes here), badly 
   recorded sound, fight scenes that look as if they were choreographed 
   by someone with cerebal palsey and Lou Ferrigno's incredibly lame 
   line readings (yeah, I know he's deaf but, c'mon people, he's simply 
   awful). This is a total embarassment for everyone involved and is 
   enjoyable for that fact alone. Watching this film is like passing a 
   bad accident in your car. You know when you slow down to look at it, 
   you may not like what you see, but you just can't help yourself. <B><A HREF="desert_warrior_1988c.htm">DESERT

   (in a subterranean cave). The Queen resurrects warrior Banyu Jaga 
   (Advent Bangun) to stop a wedding being performed by the tribe. He 
   flies through the air, standing atop a boulder (like he was riding a 
   surfboard!) and disrupts the wedding (when he jumps off the boulder, 
   it crushes a tribal member against a tree). He tells the tribal 
   leader that the Queen wants his newly-married son-in-law as a 
   sacrifice (She fucks all her sacrifices and turns them into love 
   slaves or cannibals that she keeps locked in a cage). When the tribal 
   leader refuses, Banyu Jaga goes about killing nearly every male 
   member of the tribe (decapitating a few and sending one guy twenty 
   feet up in the air with a strike of his two curved swords). He then 
   fights the tribal leader (he cuts off his hand and then disembowels 
   him) and his daughter, the Bride, (and her umbrella of doom), before 
   warrior Mandala (Barry Prima) arrives in town to save her. Mandala 
   and Banyu Jaga (who once had the same master) fight it out, but Banyu 
   resurrects some Crocodile Men out of the earth and they keep Mandala 
   busy while Banyu delivers the groom to the Queen. Mandala gets a 
   telepathic message from his master that he is in trouble and rushes 
   to his home where Mandala discovers his master near death, his legs 
   infected with puss-filled lesions. Mandala goes to the forest to 
   retrieve a magic mushroom (in a scene that screams out &quot;What The 
   Fuck?!?&quot;), grabs one, makes a potion and gives it to his master. 
   He then cuts off both his master's legs with a sword to save his 
   life! His legless master then gives Mandala a parchment, which is 
   actually a map to the &quot;Mountain of Swords&quot;, the location of 
   the Devil's Sword we saw being made in the beginning of the film. 
   Mandala the joins forces with the Bride to rescue her beloved from 
   the clutches of the Crocodile Queen, but first they head to the 
   Mountain of Swords to retrieve the Devil's Sword. He is not alone in 
   his quest, as the Queen sends Banyu Jaga to also get the sword and 
   three other evil warriors (each with different abilities and weapons) 
   are also looking to get their mitts on it. Expect lots of gory 
   goodness to follow.&nbsp; If you're expecting logic, boy, do you have 
   the wrong film! But if you want to be totally entertained, you picked 
   the right flick. There are too many outrageous scenes and pieces of 
   dialogue to describe in this review, but my favorite happens when 
   Mandala and the Bride take a River Styx-like raft ride on their way <A HREF="devils_sword_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/devil's sword german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    the Mountain of Swords. They are met on the bank of the bubbling, 
   smoke-filled lake by a robed figure on a raft. When they are in the 
   middle of the lake, the robed figure reveals itself to be a skeleton 
   (!) and then they are attacked by three crocodiles that stand up on 
   their hind legs (you really gotta see it to believe it!). The 
   crocodiles attack them with huge serrated-edged swords (they look 
   like chainsaw blades), until Mandala, the Bride and even the skeleton 
   dispatch them by impalement or decapitation (a preferred way of death 
   in this film). I guarantee that you will rewind this scene a few 
   times, just to satisfy yourself that you didn't imagine it. The whole 
   film has a delirious feel to it (the set design of the Crocodile 
   Queen's underground lair is a marvel of imagination), including the 
   trio of nasty warriors looking for the sword. They include a 
   toothless old woman with a whip (She says to one warrior, &quot;Wanna 
   play around a little?); a bald-headed guy with a flying hat that 
   decapitates people (He calls the old woman a &quot;dirty daughter of 
   a whore!&quot;), which is a direct steal from <B><A HREF="master_of_the_flying_guillotine_1975.htm">MAST</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="master_of_the_flying_guillotine_1975.htm">ER

   tells the old woman, &quot;You smell worse than death!&quot;). Their 
   fight against each other and Banyu Jaga at the mouth of the cave that 
   holds the Devil's Sword is a classic of weird cinema and I love that 
   the old woman gets most of the insults directed at her (Including,

   blame the killings on the little girl and her dirt-poor family, as

    kids tries to pull the scarf off of Manda's head (she's never 
   without it), he is bitten by snakes and dies. The townspeople burn 
   down Manda's parents house in retribution, killing her mother and 
   father. Years pass and Manda (Rosemarie Gil; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMamba">BLACK
    MAMBA</A></B> - 1974), now a grown woman, lives in an underground 
   cave in the mountains by herself. Manda has not forgotten about her 
   parents' murders and every once in a while she and her snakes travel 
   close to town to get some payback on those responsible for their 
   deaths. She blackmails a clan of nomadic bandits to help her get 
   revenge (she threatens them with her horde of snakes to keep them in 
   line) and she has them try to kidnap Tina, the daughter of a wealthy 
   local. Luckily, visiting Chinaman Shu Wen (Alex Tang Lec), arrives 
   just in time to save Tina and kicks the asses of the bandits with his 
   superior kung fu skills. This only pisses off Manda, who sends her 
   snakes into town to commit more murders, which forces the townspeople 
   to rely on reluctant stranger Shu Wen and his unbeatable martial arts 
   techniques to help them defeat Manda, her snakes and the bandits. 
   When Manda and the bandits finally do manage to kidnap Tina, Shu Wen 
   must single-handedly defeat the hordes of bandits (who seem to get 
   larger in number as the film progresses) in hand-to-hand combat, 
   karate-chop a bunch of snakes (some of the flying variety!) and then 
   face-off with Manda, who finally removes her scarf to reveal a bunch 
   of slithery snakes where her hair should be. The finale reveals that 
   Manda doesn't just control snakes, she can also shoot fireballs from 
   her fingertips and become invisible at will. Too bad the snakes on 
   her head didn't look behind her, because as Manda is walking 
   backwards while doing battle with Shu Wen, she falls off a cliff and 
   dies.&nbsp; While the English dubbing is atrocious, <B>DEVIL WOMAN</B>

    a bunch of local girls while she sits on her throne watching it all, 
   until she suddenly changes her mind and sics her snakes on one bandit 
   who is raping just a little too rough! While the film is obviously 
   lensed in the Philippines, the only person in the cast who is worth a 
   damn is Chinese and, even though he refuses to fight, he manages to 
   kick butt every ten minutes or so. While this film can't match the

   This is the best laugh that I've had in a long time although I doubt

   vigilante-style. With his arsenal of cross-shaped weapons and martial 
   arts skills, he kills all the heathens that cross his path, but not 
   before giving them one last chance to repent. Father Daniel also has 
   &quot;the sight&quot;, the ability to know something is going to 
   happen before it does. The town is also under the grip of terror 
   known as the &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; (terribly overplayed by a 
   chunky Don Stroud), a psychopath who kills women by draining and 
   drinking their blood then cutting off their heads. He then boils the 
   heads and uses the skulls for his enjoyment (he uses one as a cereal 
   bowl!). He makes a couple of visits to Father Daniel's confessional, 
   where he taunts the poor Father. Since the confessional is sacred, 
   Father Daniel must take the law into his own hands. Spouting such 
   hilarious lines as, &quot;Open the gates of Hell, for I am the right 
   hand of God!&quot;, he hunts down the Vampire Killer and plants a 
   crucifix-shaped dagger into his heart. The strange finale suggests 
   that Father Daniel may indeed be God himself! This habit-forming (no 
   pun intended) piece of sacreligious schlock is poorly made but holds 
   your attention due to its offbeat subject matter. The sound is bad, 
   the actors step on each other's lines and the plot situations have to 
   be seen to be believed. Judy Landers plays the miniskirted 
   housekeeper (!) of the parish. Erik Estrada (spelled &quot;Eric&quot;

   Michael Vincent (again showing what alcohol and cocaine abuse can do 
   to a career) is another priest who gets knifed in the neck by Stroud. 
   Jim Brown and Robert Z'dar portray drug runners who get swift justice

   &quot;the sight&quot; and helps Father Daniel find the Vampire 
   Killer. There's even a Japanese Madonna-wannabe named Hiroko who 
   sings us her latest hit. I'll bet none of these people will ever use 
   this film as a reference! Yet, it is facinating in so many ways with

    We then see newlyweds John (Carlos Pinar) and his bride Mary (Carole

   they cruise to Nassau. As John and Mary are talking to Mr. Miles on 
   the ship's radio, the water around them begins to boil and the yellow 
   light engulfs the ship, causing the radio to lose contact with them. 
   Mr. Miles, who loves his daughter with all his heart, sends a Coast 
   Guard helicopter and a ship to look for the newlyweds, but the 
   chopper has mysterious engine trouble and so does the ship (blamed on 
   &quot;magnetic interference&quot;), forcing the Coast Guard to cancel 
   the search and return to base. Mr. Miles is not satisfied and tries 
   to hire Professor Peters (Manuel Zarzo; <B><A HREF="my_dear_killer_1972.htm">MY
    DEAR KILLER</A></B> - 1972), based on his writings and theories 
   about &quot;alternate dimensions&quot; caused by &quot;whirlpools of 
   energy&quot; that are capable of attracting objects and absorbing 
   them, sending the objects to another dimension. Professor Peters 
   tells Mr. Miles to accept the fact that his daughter and son-in-law 
   are gone, because the waters surrounding the Bermudas can never be 
   explained, but Mr. Miles still has hopes of finding them alive and 
   unharmed. Mr. Miles offers to finance all of Peters' experiments if 
   he will help him and wants no guarantees, just hopes that they are 
   still alive. Peters accepts, but first he has to assemble a crew. 
   Peters' first hire is Scott (Producer Andres Garcia; the star of similarly-themed
    <B><A HREF="#BermudaTriangle1978">THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE</A></B> - 
   1978), an old friend of his, who captains his own boat. Scott hires 
   Mike (Gianni Garko; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">THE

    Once there, Scott and Peters dive to the ocean floor, where they are 
   almost devoured by a shark, but they find a cave emitting a bright 
   yellow light (uh, oh!). As Mickey starts barking uncontrollably, 
   Scott and Peters decide to go back to the boat, putting off looking 
   in the cave for another time. Once on board, Peters gives Mr. Miles 
   some hope, telling him, &quot;There exist forces from outer space 
   situated below the seas. John Spencer sustains, however, that other 
   beings from outer space visit us periodically on this planet, 
   carrying out authentic kidnappings. Unifying these two theories, I've 
   come to the conclusion that these disappearances are due to the 
   workings of extra-human intelligences and that they work in the 
   depths of the seas.&quot; (I just have two questions: Who in the hell 
   is John Spencer? And what the hell is an &quot;authentic&quot; 
   kidnapping?). As Peters is talking to Mr. Miles, the sea in front of 
   them begins to bubble with a yellow hue, but then it stops as quickly 
   as it began. Ronnie tells Mr. Miles that he thinks this alien 
   intelligence were the first humans on Earth and now they want to come 
   back to claim the planet as their own.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Mike dives into the ocean to try out a new camera, 
   but an orb of yellow light engulfs him, sucking all the oxygen out of 
   his scuba tank. Scott dives in and brings Mike to safety, but he has 
   been without oxygen for over three minutes. Scott is able to revive 
   him, but Mickey begins to bark and growl at Mike like he doesn't know 
   him. It is obvious to the viewer that Mike is no longer Mike and it 
   is also not lost on Scott, who tells Pop to keep an eye on him while 
   he, Ronnie and Peters make a second dive to the cave. On their way to 
   the cave, Peters' gear gets caught on some rocks, so Scott frees him 
   and they all head back to the boat, but Ronnie never surfaces. Mike 
   tells them not to bother to look for Ronnie because it is useless to 
   attempt it. Scott dives in anyway, but his search for his friend is 
   unsuccessful. Peters tells Scott that they are closer than anyone to 
   solving this mystery, especially when he discovers one of the rocks 
   he collected during their dives is made out of pure plutonium, a 
   metal that solves the problem of force versus weight, in other words, 
   this part of the ocean floor could be a storage base for outer space 
   provisions (I know, WTF?!?). The Coast Guard radios Scott, asking for 
   his position and when Scott gives it to them, the Coast Guard informs 
   him that a freighter is heading right for him, but they lost contact 
   with them when they radioed in that they were surrounded by yellow 
   lights. Scott's boat then enters a thick fog bank and radar shows 
   they are close to the freighter, so Scott and Peters decide to board 
   it, even though Mr. Miles informs them that's not why they are here 
   (but there are rules at sea that Scott must follow and that includes 
   boarding a ship that doesn't respond to radio contact).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Scott and Peters board the freighter, but no one is on board, it's a 
   ghost ship, even though someone's pipe is still smoking and the 
   ship's engines are still warm. They head back to Scott's boat and 
   radio the Coast Guard with the freighter's position, so they can tow 
   it back to shore. Suddenly, the freighter disappears on Scott's radar 
   and when they go on deck, it is nowhere to be seen. Scott then wants

   trying to mystify the audience, but if you have no knowledge about 
   the Bermuda Triangle, all it will leave you with is confusion. Also 
   adding to the confusion is the scientific mumbo-jumbo that comes out 
   of Peters' mouth, which we are supposed to take as fact, but very few 
   people will understand it because it really makes no sense at all. 
   Even with all this against it, the film works as a fantasy if you can 
   put your mind in neutral and just go along for the ride. Be aware 
   that there is no nudity or bloody violence and you may find yourself 
   enjoying the experience. It is a decent little mystery that has a 
   proper finale, but you'll forget about the film as soon as it ends

   samurai master Yoshi (Hiroshi Fujioka) is shot with an arrow and 
   crashes through the ice of a frozen lake after unsuccessfully trying 
   to rescue his wife from a rival clan (she dies after an enemy fighter 
   impales her with a throwing knife). Over four hundred years later, 
   Yoshi's body is found encased in ice and a scientific team, led by 
   Dr. Alan Richards (John Calvin), attempt to revive him. Viewing the 
   procedure is oriental antiquities expert Chris Welles (Janet Julian),

   expert. When Yoshi comes to, Chris and Dr. Richards try to speak to 
   him (without much luck) and then Chris gives him back his sword and 
   clothes (a risky move that pays off). Chris begins to build a

   world for the first time. He is amazed at the sight of cars (he's

   around town. Chris begins searching the street for Yoshi, fearing for 
   his life, as Yoshi battles Johnny Tooth and the rest of his gang, who 
   use motorcycles and guns with little effect. Chris finally catches up 
   with Yoshi and tries to shield him from Dr. Richards (who wants to 
   dissect him) and the police, but Richards kidnaps Yoshi and tries to 
   kill him by injecting an air bubble in his heart. It doesn't work and 
   Yoshi and Chris steal a horse with the police and Dr. Richards not 
   far behind. The police capture Chris while Yoshi leads a police 
   helicopter on a chase. After killing Dr. Richards, saving Chris and

   slow-moving, but never boring, fantasy fish-out-of-water tale. 
   Yoshi's interaction with the modern world is never played for comic 
   relief on his behalf, but rather as how an intelligent person would 
   react to things that are unknown (one comical scene has two diners 
   mistaken Yoshi for Toshiro Mifune when he walks into a Japanese 
   restaurant!). There are bloody bits of violence whenever Yoshi uses 
   his sword, as hands and other appendages are sliced up or open (both 
   Johnny Tooth and Dr. Richards die memorable deaths). While this film 
   was primarily made to cash in on the success of <B><A HREF="iceman_1984.htm">ICEMAN</A></B> 
   (1984), it has enough merit and heart to stand on it's own. It's a 
   nice way to spend a laid-back 81 minutes that's punctuated by some 
   unexpected moments of graphic violence and some racist dialogue 
   (Johnny and his gang call Yoshi &quot;nip&quot;, &quot;slant

   &quot;bonzai&quot; is a racist term). Originally made as <B>SWORDKILL</B>

   turns out that Mina drops two baby boys, twins, just as Nuriak and

   people's destiny, telling her to run away as fast as she can. The 
   Hungat kill everyone they come in contact with, cutting off heads and 
   slaughtering men, women and children with axes and swords. Mevian 
   puts up a gallant fight, but he is run-through several times by 
   Hungat barbarian swords, leaving Mina on her own at the mercy of 
   Nuriak, who decapitates her with his sword. When he learns Mina has 
   just delivered a baby boy (he has no idea there are two of them), he 
   orders his men to look for and kill it. We then see Nayda running 
   like the wind to avoid the Hungat, the twin boys in her arms. When 
   she reaches a beach, she collapses, when a band of Amazons, members 
   of the Kuniak tribe find a dead Nayda on the beach, the twin baby

   for beheading his mother, not knowing that Nameless has stolen a 
   horse and has escaped the village. We then see Nuriak telling his 
   tribe of barbarians that he must kill Zukahn before the Prophecy 
   comes true (How long is this Prophecy anyway???). Nameless is looking 
   for Nuriak, thinking that if he kills him, the Kuniaks will let him 
   live a free life. He runs into Nuriak in the desert and tells him he 
   is Zukahn, but Nuriak doesn't believe him and they get into a sword 
   fight, leading to Nuriak beheading Nameless with his sword. While the

   for the deaths of his mother and brother. Zukahn faces down Nuriak, 
   only to get an arrow in his back, shot by another member of the

   kidnapped to &quot;copulate&quot; with their men (The Amazon women 
   are barren and unable to bear children, so they kidnap women to screw 
   with their mates and get pregnant, therefore letting their tribe 
   continue to exist). Marga gets extremely jealous when she sees Zukahn 
   falling in love with Lenni, so she decides to do something to Lenni 
   so Zukahn doesn't copulate with her. Zukahn is knocked out by four 
   men he has never seen before and Lenni is kidnapped. When Zukahn 
   wakes up, he puts a gory beatdown on the four men, killing them, and 
   rescues Lenni. He tells her that they belong together, but he must 
   leave because he is on a mission to avenge his mother and brother's 
   deaths. Thanks to Marga's treachery, the Queen banishes Zukahn for 
   crimes against the Kuniak (the four men he killed were Kuniak tribe 
   members), telling him that Lenni will be given to one of their men to 
   procreate with. Zukahn refuses to leave, challenging the best Amazon

   do what he pleases, also telling him that Zukahn will try to rescue 
   her, setting up Zukahn for certain death. Marga tells Zukahn that

   letting his emotions overrule his brain. Zukahn is captured and tied 
   to a rack and Nuriak makes Lenni hug Zukahn goodbye, as wooden spikes 
   slowly pierce the flesh on her back. Nuriak leaves, telling Zukahn 
   that he will watch helplessly as the spikes slowly go through Lenni's 
   body, but Zukahn and Lenni escape (Don't ask me how!). The Queen 
   discovers Marga's treachery and kills all of Nuriak's men with her

   Back in the infancy of the Italian Sword-&amp;-Sandal (or 
   &quot;Peplum&quot;, if you prefer) genre, producer Achille Piazzi 
   hired Mario Bava, fresh off his triumphant horror film <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSunday1960">BLACK
    SUNDAY</A></B> (1960; the film that jump-started the Italian Horror 
   genre), to direct/photograph/co-write this film, a mixture of 
   muscleheaded heroics with horror overtones, making this the first 
   film to achieve that glory (others include <B><A HREF="goliath_and_the_vampires_1961.htm">GOLIATH

   cinematography, which is bathed in primary color gel lighting,<A HREF="hercules_in_the_haunted_world_1961.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("198","303") --><IMG SRC="images/hercules in the haunted world poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   making every sequence the equivalent to a Renaissance painting. Is 
   the plot ridiculous? Sure, it is, but you'll be forgetting that 
   minutes after this film begins and concentrate on the wonderful and 
   colorful set designs and backgrounds, showing us what a master Bava 
   was with a camera. This is a feast for the eyes, not the mind, and in

    The film opens with a masked oracle of the Gods named Medea (Gaia 
   Germani; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CastleLivDead1964">CASTLE OF

    a kingdom city of ancient Greece in an age of myth and legend. It is 
   a time when Olympian gods and demigods rule over the elements of 
   nature and control the destinies of men.&quot;</FONT></B> She goes on 
   to say that Hercules (Reg Park; <B><A HREF="maciste_in_king_solomons_mines_1964.htm">MACISTE
    IN KING SOLOMON'S MINES</A></B> - 1964) has returned to Ecalia to be 
   with his future wife, Princess Deianira (Leonora Ruffo; <B><A HREF="star_pilot_1966.htm">STAR
    PILOT</A></B> - 1966), after learning that her father, the King, has 
   just died. But Hercules doesn't know that the Princess is being 
   controlled by the evil Lico (Christopher Lee; Bava's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WhipAndTheBody1963">THE
    WHIP AND THE BODY</A></B> - 1963), destroying her memory and nearly 
   putting her on her deathbed. Medea calls Lico a &quot; diabolical 
   vampire&quot;, as all he wants is to do is kill Hercules so he can 
   rule Italia alone (He pretends to be Princess Deianira's uncle, so if 
   she dies, he would be the next in line to take over). After Medea 
   tells us this (a sequence that is missing from some prints, which 
   deletes Medea from the entire film, even though she is very important 
   to the plot!), we see Hercules arriving on the outskirts of Ecalia 
   and calling out the name &quot;Theseus&quot; (Giorgio 
   &quot;George&quot; Ardisson; Bava's <B><A HREF="erik_the_conqueror_1961.htm">ERIK
    THE CONQUEROR</A></B> - 1961), but he ignores Hercules' calls and 
   continues kissing beautiful women Jocasta (Ely Draco) in a hayloft 
   (Theseus is a notorious womanizer of married women and Hercules' best 
   friend). A group of assassins, sent by Lico, try to kill Hercules and 
   Theseus, but they both make the assassins sorry that they even tried 
   and run away (after Hercules throws a horse cart into the air and 
   demolishes the hayloft). Lico, mad because his assassins failed to 
   kill Hercules, makes the leader of the assassins pay with his life 
   when several metal spears impale his body after he reaches for 
   valuable gold trinkets in Lico's treasure chest (a memorable 
   booby-trap). As Hercules travels to the town square of Ecalia 
   (Theseus says he will join him in a couple of days, as Hercules needs 
   some alone time with the Princess and he is too busy with Jocasta at 
   the moment), an Ecalia resident named Keros (Mino Doro; <B><A HREF="hercules_and_the_captive_women_1961.htm">HERCULES
    AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN</A></B> - 1961) informs Hercules that Princess 
   Deianira hasn't been seen in weeks and Lico, who has taken over as 
   King of Ecalia, knows what is wrong with her. Hercules then meets 
   Lico, who informs him that the Princess is in dire shape (&quot;She 
   has been cursed by the Gods.&quot;) and unless a cure is found, she 
   will die in a matter of weeks. Lico's false concerns makes Hercules 
   demand to see his future bride, but when Lico tells him where to find 
   her, he is dismayed to learn that Princess Deianira doesn't even 
   recognize him and is begging for death to take her (Previously, we 
   saw that Lico is keeping the Princess in a stone tomb in his 
   underground lair, using his evil powers to awaken her, as we watch 
   her eerily rise vertically from her stone coffin). When Keros ends up 
   dead after telling Hercules he has some important information to tell 
   him about Lico, Hercules goes to Medea for help and she informs him 
   that the only known cure for Deianira's condition is to retrieve the 
   Stone Of Forgetfulness from the Realm of Hades, the domain of the God 
   Pluto. But, in order to gain access to and leaving Hades safely, he 
   will need to get the Golden Apple from the Garden of the Hesperides. 
   To prove his devotion to Princess Deianira, Hercules returns his gift 
   of immortality to the Gods, including his father, Zeus. After some 
   thunder and lightning bolts by Zeus, it's off to the adventure of 
   Hercules' life.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    After enlisting the aide of Theseus and his friend Telemachus 
   (Franco Giacobini; <B><A HREF="uncle_was_a_vampire_1959.htm">UNCLE 
   WAS A VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1959; who is the comic relief here), who is 
   Jocasta's intended husband (!), Hercules must find a ship to take him 
   to the Land of the Hesperides and Telemachus says he knows where to 
   get one; he has a friend named Sunis (Aldo Pedinotti; <B><A HREF="atlas_in_the_land_of_the_cyclops_1961.htm">ATLAS

   THE CYCLOPS</A></B> - 1961) that will gladly loan them his ship. We 
   then see Telemachus tied between two horses, as Sunis is anything but 
   a friend and is about to have Telemachus drawn-and-quartered for 
   being a little too friendly with his wife. Hercules saves him by 
   grabbing the ropes of both horses while Theseus has a sword fight 
   with Sunis. Theseus wins, cuts the ropes attached to Telemachus, 
   saving him the loss of his arms and legs, while Sunis is seen chasing 
   after his two escaping horses. They then take the ship and begin 
   their first part of their long journey, full of fright and even 
   possibly death.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While sailing to the Garden of the Hesperides, Hercules tells 
   Theseus and Telemachus that the Garden of the Hesperides resides on 
   an island he has no idea how to get to, as it is located in the 
   &quot;dark eternal region of the night&quot;. Hercules is depending 
   on the Gods to show him the way, when all three suddenly get tired 
   and fall asleep immediately. When they wake up, they discover that 
   they are in the Garden of the Hesperides and are surrounded by 
   beautiful women. Their Queen, Aretheus (Marissa Belli; <A HREF="women_of_devils_island_1962.htm"><B>WOMEN
    OF DEVIL'S ISLAND</B></A> - 1962), informs Hercules that she can 
   show him where the Golden Apple resides, at the top of the Sacred 
   Tree, but warns him that if he doesn't get the Golden Apple, it means 
   death to anyone who isn't successful. Hercules goes by himself, 
   accompanied by Queen Aretheus and her female flock, while Theseus and 
   Telemachus wait behind lying on two stone beds (a really large one 
   for Theseus and a way-too-small one for Telemachus) to catch up on 
   some much-needed sleep (Hey, haven't they had enough?). We hear the 
   Queen tell the women that Theseus and Telemachus are as good as dead, 
   or at least they will be in a short while. Hercules climbs the Sacred 
   Tree and just when it seems he is going to grab the Golden Apple, 
   fire starts raining down on him, he loses his balance and nearly 
   falls to his death, but he catches himself on a tree branch and 
   climbs back down. Hercules hasn't given up hope, however. He makes a 
   sling out of a horse's bridal, attaches a huge boulder to it and 
   throws it at the tree branch holding the Golden Apple, hitting it 
   just right, as the branch falls to the ground. He grabs the Golden 
   Apple and Queen Aretheus tells Hercules that he has <A HREF="hercules_in_the_haunted_world_1961.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("229","305") --><IMG SRC="images/hercules in the haunted world dvd front6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>released
    herself and her flock from the eternal darkness they were cursed to 
   live for eternity in and now they are able to travel to the light 
   side. She tells Hercules that a monster made of stone, Procrustles, 
   is about to kill his friends. Hercules races to save them, as we 
   watch Procrustles try to stretch Theseus so he fits on his large bed 
   and then tries to shrink Telemachus to fit on the small bed! Hercules 
   arrives in the nick of time, picks up Procrustles and throws him 
   against a stone wall, killing him and revealing the way to the Gates 
   of Hades. Leaving Telemachus behind to guard the Golden Apple, 
   Hercules and Theseus enter the Realm Of Hades.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once in Hades, Hercules learns to trust his mind and not his eyes 
   because some of the obstacles in their way (but not all of them) are 
   simply illusions (A naked girl in chains, her private parts covered 
   by her hair and the chains, tempts Theseus, until Hercules pulls him 
   away. Man, that Theseus is one horndog!). They travel through some 
   living vines that bleed and scream, containing the souls of men sent 
   to Hades and eventually come to the location of the Stone of 
   Forgetfulness, but there's a real river of molten lava blocking their 
   way. Once again, this time using a vine, Hercules fashions a sling 
   with a huge boulder and throws it perfectly (&quot;May the Gods guide 
   my hands!&quot;) to the small island holding the Stone. Hercules uses 
   it to slowly make his way to the island hand over hand and Theseus 
   joins him, but Theseus is no Hercules and halfway there falls into 
   the river of Lava and dies. Or so we think. While a heartbroken 
   Hercules makes to to the island and gets his hands on the Stone of 
   Forgetfulness, we see that Theseus is not dead at all, saved by a 
   woman named Persephone (Ida Galli, better known to us as &quot;Evelyn 
   Stewart&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#MurderMansion1972">THE 
   MURDER MANSION</A></B> - 1972), and it's love at first sight for the 
   both of them. Neither Hercules or Theseus knows this, but Persephone 
   is actually the favorite daughter of the God Pluto and taking her out 
   of the Realm of Hades will cause a world of hurt. As Hercules, 
   Theseus, Telemachus and Persephone head back to Ecalia in the ship, a 
   freak deadly storm hits the ship, Persephone telling Theseus to throw 
   the Golden Apple overboard if they want to live. Theseus does just 
   that, much to Hercules chagrin, but when the bad weather instantly 
   disappears and the Sun shines. it is quickly forgotten. The Sun 
   shining is not always a good thing, as Hercules will learn when he 
   arrives in Ecalia.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Hercules steps foot in Ecalia, he learns that an evil darkness 
   has taken over the land and most of the residents blame Hercules for 
   it (and they are basically right). Hercules cures Princess Deianira 
   of her deadly malady using the Stone of Forgetfulness, but in order 
   to get everything back to normal, he will have to do something to 
   stop the darkness from taking over. He goes to the oracle Medea and 
   she tells him that Theseus' new love is actually Pluto's favorite 
   daughter and if Ecalia is to become good again, he will have to 
   convince Theseus to let Persephone go back to Hades, but Theseus 
   tells his new love that he will kill anyone who tries to take her 
   away from him, even Hercules. Meanwhile, Lico (remember him?) has to 
   kill Princess Deianira and drink her blood during an upcoming Lunar 
   eclipse in order for him to live eternally as the King of Ecalia. 
   Hercules tries to get Theseus to let go of Persephone so the city can 
   return to normal, but Theseus tries unsuccessfully to kill Hercules. 
   Persephone then throws a forgetfulness spell on Theseus so she can go 
   back to Hades and her father. She sacrifices herself so Theseus can 
   live. During the lunar eclipse, Lico kidnaps Princess Deianira and is 
   about to kill her in his underground lair, when Hercules intervenes. 
   But first Hercules has to deal with all the flying ghouls (!) and 
   zombies Lico has released from their graves and tombs (it's a very 
   early example of zombies rising slowly from their graves, which would 
   become commonplace in Italy during the late-'70s &amp; '80s). After 
   killing them all (throwing stone pillar after stone pillar at them, 
   crushing them under the weight), the lunar eclipse ends and when the 
   light hits a wounded Lico, he catches on fire and dies. The film ends 
   with Telemachus showing up on a beach where Hercules, Princess 
   Deianira and Theseus are enjoying the sun. Telemachus tells them that 
   Jocasta&nbsp; has finally agreed to marrry him, but when she sets 
   eyes on Theseus, she immediately forgets about her intended and 
   throws herself at Hercules' best friend. The film ends with Hercules 
   saying, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;As long as Theseus steals other 
   men's girls, I have nothing to worry about.&quot;</FONT></B> <FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>THE

    Watching this film just proves that director Mario Bava could make 
   any genre of film he put his mind to something very stunning and 
   entertaining. While I am certainly no fan of the Italian 
   Sword-&amp;-Sandal genre (Too many of them were shown on TV in the 
   '60s &amp; '70s for my liking, as I found the majority of them very 
   boring, especially through a child's eyes), I make the exception when 
   it comes to this film because Bava lent his talent as a 
   cinematographer (which is how he started in the film business) shine 
   through the material. The screenplay, by Bava, Alessandro Continenza (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Let Sleeping Corpse">LET
    SLEEPING CORPSES LIE</A></B> - 1974), Franco Prosperi (director of <B><A HREF="action.htm#MeetHim&amp;Die1976">MEET
    HIM AND DIE</A></B> - 1976 and <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#LastHouseBeach">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE BEACH</A></B> - 1978) and Duccio Tessari (<B><A HREF="colossus_and_the_amazon_queen_1960.htm">COLOSSUS
    AND THE AMAZON QUEEN</A></B> - 1960 and director of <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainButter71">THE
    BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY</A></B> - 1971), is full of nonsensical 
   situations, but the way Bava films them, using miniature sets, forced 
   perspective and other photographic in-camera tricks, makes them very 
   colorful and entertaining. Where other directors may have failed 
   miserably, Bava succeeds in spades thanks to his eye in filming a 
   scene like no other director before him (Dario Argento copied many of 
   his photographic tricks and even his use of gel lighting, to varying 
   degrees of success). Even when he wasn't working in color, Bava still 
   had a masterful hand with a camera, which can be seen in such films 
   as <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DevilsCommandment57">THE DEVIL'S COMMANDMENT</A></B> 
   - 1957, <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Caltiki1959">CALTIKI, THE 
   IMMORTAL MONSTER</A></B> (1959) and the aforementioned <B><A HREF="black_sunday_1960.htm">BLACK
    SUNDAY</A></B> (1960). But when he switched over to color, he became 
   The Master, as films such as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSabbath1963">BLACK
    SABBATH</A></B> (1963), <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD

    OF THE VAMPIRES</A></B> (1965) and <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillBabyKill1966">KILL,
    BABY...KILL</A></B> (1966) showed us how much color, when used 
   correctly, could improve a horror film immensely, every color having 
   its own meaning. It should be no surprise that the Realm of Hades is 
   bathed in the color<A HREF="hercules_in_the_haunted_world_1961.htm"><IMG SRC="images/hercules in the haunted world italy dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   red, Medea's lair is lathered in blue hues and Lico's underground 
   lair shown in purple and green tones, giving each of them their own 
   distinct look and feel. All-in all, this is a film even diehard 
   Sword-and-Sandal haters are bound to love just because of these 
   touches. I have yet to find a Bava film that I didn't like. I still 
   have a few more to go (<B><A HREF="evil_eye_1963.htm">THE GIRL WHO 
   KNEW TOO MUCH</A></B> [a.k.a. <B><A HREF="evil_eye_1963.htm">EVIL EYE</A></B>

   THE HONEYMOON</A></B> - 1970 and <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON
    BLOOD</A></B> - 1972), but I doubt that my mind will be changed. So 
   ignore the acting (especially by Franco Giacobini as Telemachus, who 
   overacts shamelessly) and enjoy the eye candy. Sometimes that is all 
   that we need. It should be noted that Reg Park only appeared in five 
   of these films (and nothing else), but he went on to become the 
   trainer to Arnold Schwarzenegger after losing the Mr. Universe title 
   to him (by half a point!) in 1970 at the age of 42! He became a 
   &quot;second father&quot; to Schwarzenegger until his death in 2007 
   at the age of 79 due to melanoma (skin cancer), proving a tanned body 
   is not always a healthy body.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Release Version, except for some name changes and a couple minutes 
   more of unneeded exposition. While I usually prefer the foreign 
   version in its original language, this film goes against that norm, 
   since the U.S. Version is superior in both dialogue and picture

    LANTERNS</A><A NAME="HumanLanterns"></A> (1982) -</B> Another 
   amazingly bizarre martial arts fantasy courtesy of the prolific Shaw 
   Brothers and director Sun Chung. Master Lung (Liu Yung, a.k.a. Tony 
   Liu) and Master Tan (Chen Kuan Tai) are bitter rivals who try to 
   embarrass each other in public as much as possible. At a gathering of 
   their entire village, Master Tan insults Lung by not only announcing 
   that he will have the winning entry in the upcoming Lantern Festival, 
   he also trots out Lung's ex-mistress Yen Chu (Linda Chu) and declares 
   her to be his newest concubine, which is not only a slap in the face 
   to Lung, but also to Lung's wife, Chin (Tanny; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic2">BLACK
    MAGIC 2</A></B> - 1976), who is also in attendance. Determined to 
   win the Lantern Festival, Lung hires master lantern maker Chung Fang 
   (Lo Lieh; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic1975">BLACK MAGIC</A></B> 
   - 1975), an old rival of Lung's who, seven years earlier, dueled Lung 
   for Chin's hand and lost (he still bears the facial scars from Lung's 
   sword), to make him the finest lantern money can buy. Fang 
   reluctantly agrees, but only on one condition: Lung cannot return to 
   Fang's workshop (a marvelously macabre place) until he is finished 
   with the lantern. Lung agrees and celebrates their collaboration by 
   taking Fang to a brothel, where Lung runs into Yen Chu and <A HREF="human_lanterns_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/human lanterns dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>threatens
    her life for becoming Tan's concubine. Later that night, someone 
   wearing a costume (best described as looking like an ape with a hairy 
   skull mask and big-assed claws) kidnaps Yen Chu, brings her back to 
   his place and proceeds to skin her alive (a graphic effect where he 
   first cuts the top of her scalp open and pours mercury into the wound 
   so her can remove her skin in one piece [I've looked this up and it 
   was really done in ancient China!]). When the brothel's madam reports 
   Yen Chu missing and tells Sergeant Poon (Sun Chien) that she heard 
   Lung threaten Yen's life the day before, Lung becomes the town's 
   pariah, shunned by everyone. When the costumed killer, who turns out 
   to be Fang (no surprise there), kidnaps Master Tan's sister Mei (Lin 
   Hsiu Chun) and skins her alive (offscreen this time), it sets off a 
   series of deadly events involving a hired assassin (Lo Meng), the 
   kidnapping of Chin by Fang and an escalating game of one-upmanship 
   between Lung and Tan. The dueling duo realize too late that they are 
   the ones being set-up to take the big fall, as Fang rapes, then 
   kills, Chin (her skinning-alive is done in graphic close-up), Lung 
   discovers Fang's beautiful completed skin lantern (which contains 
   Chin's all-too-familiar mole!) and Fang and Tan team-up, along with 
   Sergeant Poon and his men, to fight Fang in the well-choreographed 
   finale, where Tan loses his life, Fang is burned alive and Lung is 
   left horribly scarred (much worse than he left Fang seven years 
   earlier). Lung finds redemption in his suffering, as he tells 
   Sergeant Poon to give away all his riches to the poor while he 
   travels the countryside to rediscover his humanity.&nbsp; This 
   sumptuously photographed film (the cinematography and set design are 
   sights to behold) is one part martial arts actioner and one part 
   graphic horror. Director Sun Chung (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#SexyKiller">SEXY
    KILLER</A></B> - 1976; <B><A HREF="big_bad_sis_1976.htm">BIG BAD SIS</A></B> 
   - 1976), who co-wrote the screenplay with I Kuang (<B><A HREF="mighty_peking_man_1977.htm">THE
    MIGHTY PEKING MAN</A></B> - 1977), offers many excellent fight 
   sequences (with lots of well-done wire work), along with gory scenes 
   of flaying, beheadings and other bloody mayhem. What's truly amazing 
   about this film is its total lack of likable characters (the finale 
   not withstanding), yet director Chung still makes it totally 
   mesmerizing from beginning to end. The art and set direction, along 
   with the colorful lighting schemes, also make this film stand out 
   from most films of its type. Fang's basement workshop is a thing of 
   surreal beauty, with its oversized spinning wooden gears, multitudes 
   of pieces of hanging human flesh and predominantly neon red-lit color 
   scheme, making it look like a piece of Hell has risen from below and 
   set up shop in the outskirts of the village. Some other standout 
   scenes include: Fang's fight with Mei in a barren forest; the village 
   square littered with the hanging severed heads of Fang's victims; 
   Lung and Tan's fight in a restaurant; and Lung's battle with Fang in 
   the finale, where Fang's basement lair literally collapses around 
   them (the effects work done in this scene is truly astonishing and 
   looks dangerous as hell). Although there are only two skinning scenes 
   shown onscreen, they are effective and brutal. There is some female 
   nudity on view, but director Chung makes sure that none of it is the 
   least bit sexy, as it is shown only during the flayings, which makes 
   it all the more unnerving and disturbing. Fans of Hong Kong weirdness 
   will find much to enjoy here. A classic of its kind. The only way to 
   really enjoy <B><A HREF="human_lanterns_1982b.htm">HUMAN LANTERNS</A></B>

   parents, where her father says to her, &quot;Oh no, dum-dum! Always 
   thinks she knows best. It's really your own fault!&quot; Brian runs 
   deep into the jungle, where he meets a female snake spirit (you 
   really have to see her!) and her dwarf husband. Brian wants to know 
   the location of the legendary Snake Queen (Suzzanna; <B><A HREF="#QueenOfBlackMagic">QUEEN
    OF BLACK MAGIC</A></B> - 1979), so the snake spirit wraps him in her 
   tail and tosses him there! Brian wakes up in a cave where trees are 
   made of gold (unfortunately, they are guarded by snakes and 
   scorpions) and the Snake Queen puts in an appearance. Brian offers to 
   be her sex slave is she will make him rich, so the Snake Queen makes 
   Brian an offer: He has a week to kill three women, drink their blood 
   and then dine upon their breasts! If he accomplishes these tasks, she 
   will make him wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. Suddenly, Brian is 
   dressed like Count Dracula, complete with fangs, and kills his first 
   female, a girl making out with her boyfriend in the woods. Brian 
   bites her on the neck, drinks her blood and then bites off both her 
   nipples! He then goes on to attack Suzy (also played by Suzzanna), 
   but she is saved by Carlita's brother, Joe (George Rudy), and soon 
   becomes Suzy's lover and protector. Brian tries to have it both ways 
   and makes a side deal with the female snake spirit to kill the Snake 
   Queen (it seems that the Snake Queen is responsible for the snake 
   spirit's current condition). Using a pin supplied by the snake 
   spirit, Brian stabs the Snake Queen while making love, permanently 
   turning her into a snake and losing her powers. Suddenly, Brian has 
   more money and power then he knows what to do with, so he becomes the 
   boss of a criminal organization and tries to buy Carlita's hand in 
   marriage from her father. He turns Brian down and shortly thereafter 
   (with the snake spirit's help), Carlita's father is throwing up 
   centipedes at the dinner table and dies when a huge snake bloodily 
   bursts out of his chest. Carlita is then supernaturally taunted by a 
   pair of scaly hands while sitting on a couch in a bid to convince her 
   to marry Brian. All hell breaks loose when Joe removes the pin from 
   the snake's body and the Snake Queen takes human form once again. 
   Thinking that she is Suzy, he makes love to her, which opens a whole 
   new can of snakes, involving revenge, a fake s&eacute;ance, mistaken 
   identities, kidnappings and a fight involving a chainsaw. Love wins 
   out in the end and all the good girls and guys live happily ever 
   after. So does the Snake Queen.&nbsp; I've said it once and I'll say

   which involves fights to the death between the Snake Queen and the 
   snake spirit (her snake body makeup can't be described using mere 
   words) and Joe vs. Brian and his men (a chainsaw is involved), are 
   best left for the viewer to experience. I haven't even mentioned that 
   earlier in the film, the Snake Queen magically makes a disobedient 
   man's clothes disappear and then impales him through the stomach with 
   a sharp spike that suddenly pops-up out of the ground. Then, the 
   Snake Queen's handmaidens cannibalize his body until only his bloody 
   skeleton is left! Do I have to describe anything else to convince you 
   to search this out? I didn't think so. A lot of sources list the 
   production date of this film anywhere between 1983 and 1986, but I'm 
   going to say it was made in 1987, since the tombstone of a recently 
   deceased character shows that year as the date of his death. Also 
   starring Dorman Borisman, S. Bono, Rita Supard and Yorita Murni. This 
   was available on VHS and DVD-R in a widescreen Japanese-subtitled

   and the object missing. After a short chase, Jackson catches up to 
   Yamato, but before he can take possession of Yamato and the object 
   (which is a statue of a cobra made out of solid gold), a tribe of 
   headhunters shoot poison darts into both Yamato and Jackson. Yamato 
   ends up dead, but the leader of the headhunters, a beautiful white 
   woman with blonde hair named April (Almanta Suska), takes pity on 
   Jackson, pulls the poison dart out of his body and floats his 
   unconscious body on a tree branch down river to civilization. It's 
   now one year later and WWII is over. Jackson is now a hopeless drunk 
   who bets on cockfights in Manila. Capt. Franks shows up and offers 
   Jackson a huge amount of money to go back into the jungle and 
   retrieve the Golden Cobra statue, which legend says gives it's owner 
   great supernatural powers. Jackson reluctantly agrees (after 
   demanding $40,000 and, much to his surprise, it's agreed on) and, 
   from that moment on, Jackson's life will never be the same. Not only 
   are several attempts made on his life, but he is also introduced to 
   American archaeologist Greenwater (Luciano Pigozzi, a.k.a. &quot;Alan 
   Collins&quot;; <B><A HREF="codename_wildgeese_1984.htm">CODE NAME: WILDGEESE</A></B>

   parent's plane crashed in the jungle. Julie (who was sent to school 
   in the States as a child) and her Uncle have come to the Philippines 
   to find April (or so they say). After Capt. Franks is killed in a car 
   bomb, Jackson, Julie and Greenwater head to the jungles of Palawan to 
   search for April and the Golden Cobra. People will fall in love, 
   motives will be revealed and lives will be lost, as the search gets 
   more treacherous the deeper they travel into the jungle. Greed proves 
   to be the undoing of two of the main characters and the surprise 
   appearance of another character proves to be a lifeline to the 
   survivors as a volcano gets ready to blow it's stack.&nbsp; While 
   nothing but a low-budget variation of <B>RAIDERS</B> (an ancient

   containing his monogrammed cigarette lighter and American Express 
   card (Don't leave home without it!). When a Brazilian official 
   arrives at the Miami home of Tom's sister, Mary (Christine Leigh; <B><A HREF="action.htm#JustADamnedSoldier">JUST
    A DAMNED SOLDIER</A></B> - 1988), with Tom's effects and a cock-and-bull
    story on how he died, Mary immediately grows suspicious. Later on 
   that day, when Mary finds her home ransacked and her German Shepard, 
   Apollo, beaten brutally to death with a baseball bat, she grows even 
   more suspicious. The capper comes when she receives a letter from Tom 
   that is postdated two days after he supposedly died and inside the 
   envelope are two photos of Tom standing next to an object that he 
   says is so remarkable, he can't describe it to her in a mere letter. 
   Mary heads to Brazil, where she learns Tom is being held prisoner in 
   a jungle camp on trumped-up drug running charges and that he knows

    OF THE SCORPION</A></B> - 1986), she talks him into helping her find 
   her brother and locate the Golden Scorpion. Tom is being held in a 
   military prison by the same people who blew up his boat in the 
   beginning of the film, on orders from evil Scottish businessman Guy 
   McDonald (Denis Bourke), who wants Tom to give him the map to the 
   Golden Scorpion location, but Tom says it was destroyed when the 
   military blew up his boat. Jim and Mary join forces with Ahmed (Max

   prison after a lengthy gunfire and explosion-filled battle (where, 
   incredibly, Mary proves adept with automatic weapons and hand 
   grenades) and they head towards the location of the Golden Scorpion, 
   with McDonald and the corrupt military not far behind. Tom leads them 
   to the Golden Scorpion, where Ahmed shows his true colors (his greed

   without an asshole!&quot; Yipes!), Keung is willing to take any job 
   offered to him, if only to stop the nagging, angry Lin from making 
   him feel like an unfit father-in-waiting. While pounding the pavement 
   looking for work, Keung answers a help wanted ad at Goldfield 
   Enterprise Limited, only to find the building crawling with police 
   and news reporters. It turns out that a crazy man has just killed the 
   manager Keung was supposed to interview with and as the paramedics 
   are carting away the manager's butchered body away, his bloody hand 
   touches Keung's trousers, leaving a rather large blood stain on them. 
   The crazy guy (who is led out of the building with a paper bag over 
   his head) was just fired from Goldfield and he returned with a 
   machete to chop-up his ex-boss. Could all this have happened because 
   fate didn't want Keung to have this job? Keung eventually finds a job 
   as a night watchman at a huge multistoried <A HREF="imp_1981b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/imp 1981 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>office
    building (he finds the job after the newspaper he is reading 
   mysteriously blows open to the page with the help-wanted ad), working 
   with other veteran watchmen like Fatty (Kent Cheng; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Run &amp; Kill">RUN
    AND KILL</A></B> - 1993), Old Uncle Han (Chan Shen) and Mr. H.K. 
   (Wing Ching). It takes a while for Keung to adjust to working the 
   night shift, and Lin, who is due to drop her baby in about a month, 
   doesn't care for her husband's new hours (there is just no pleasing 
   this bitchy woman). Mr. H.K. tries to cheer-up Keung by saying such 
   priceless nuggets as, &quot;Our wives just live like widows.&quot; 
   and &quot;After a few months, you can't tell when is daytime and when 
   is night&ldots;seeing people as if you're seeing ghosts.&quot;, but 
   Old Uncle Han tells him to quit scaring Keung, with Mr. H.K. 
   retorting, &quot;Really, it's true!&quot; Mr. H.K. may be onto 
   something because, as the film progresses, his statements begin to 
   look like truth. One night while Keung is making his rounds, he gets 
   a radio call to come down to the command center because his wife is 
   on the phone. Thinking that Lin is about to have her baby, he hops on 
   a freight elevator and begins a trip to the Twilight Zone. The 
   elevator seemingly takes him to some sub-basement levels that don't 
   exist, begins filling up with water and then opens its doors to 
   reveal a green mist where a spooky laughing noise can be heard and a 
   creepy portrait hangs on a wall. Of course, when Keung finally 
   escapes and tells his co-workers what he saw, they think he is crazy 
   because the elevator is dry as a bone. They should have believed him. 
   The lights in the office fluctuate from going dark to ultra-bright 
   and during their meal break, Mr. H.K. gets a bone stuck in his throat 
   (they are all eating a dog that Mr. H.K. killed for messing with 
   their trash!) and has to be rushed to the hospital. When the doctors 
   remove the lodged bone (graphic operation footage), Mr. H.K. suddenly 
   wakes up as if he is possessed, steps off the operating and spews mud 
   all over a doctor before collapsing and dying. Old Uncle Han, who 
   knows more than he is letting on, blames Keung for the strange events 
   that are happening and asks the building's manager to bring in some 
   monks &quot;to clean the place&quot;. The manager flatly refuses, but 
   leaves Keung's fate as a watchman in Old Uncle Han's hands. Han will 
   never get to make that decision as, later in the day, a possessed 
   newspaper (!) suffocates him in his apartment just before Keung comes 
   to visit him. Is it possible that Keung is somehow responsible for 
   everything that has or is about to happen? And why does Fatty's dog 
   want to kill Lin's unborn baby? When Keung discovers that the 
   building he is patrolling was once used as a hideout for child 
   kidnappers and many children were murdered there, he must make the 
   connection on how his birth date, the building and his pregnant wife 
   all tie together. With the help of Fatty and a Chinese ghostbuster, 
   let's hope he makes the connection before it is too late. Keung will 
   have to take a trip once again on the haunted elevator and try to 
   destroy the ghost of a devil child (the &quot;imp&quot; of the title) 
   before Lin delivers her baby and it becomes possessed by its 
   spirit.&nbsp; This Hong Kong horror film, directed by Yu Wan Kwong 
   (better known as &quot;Dennis Yu&quot; of <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Beasts1980">THE
    BEASTS</A></B> - 1980 and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EvilCat">EVIL CAT</A></B> 
   - 1986 infamy), moves at a deliberate, slow pace, but rewards patient 
   viewers, especially in the second half. While not overly gory, <B><A HREF="imp_1981c.htm">THE
    IMP</A></B> does have its fair share of inventive kills (the 
   possessed newspaper is a hoot) and plenty of creepy atmosphere. This 
   is one of the first films where I can recall &quot;fung shui&quot; is 
   used as a major plot device (if you don't know what fung shui is, 
   Google it). The screenplay, by Cheung Kam-Moon, Kam Ping-Hing and Lee 
   Dun, also uses numerology, protective scrolls and other 
   Chinese-centric devices (such as ghosts not being able to cast 
   shadows at noon and people having too much ying and not enough yang), 
   but is refreshingly humor-free (unless you count the tee shirts Fatty 
   wears; the first one says &quot;Am I A Girl?&quot; and later in the 
   film he wears another one that says &quot;No! I Am A Man&quot;, just 
   before he drives his car into the green mist and is burned alive). 
   Some inventive camerawork and a good music score also enhance this 
   film, making it worthwhile viewing for Hong Kong horror fans (and 
   since this is a Hong Kong horror film, don't expect a happy ending).

   film opens with archaeologist Albert (Charles Kaufman) leading a 
   small group of scientists (including his wife and small daughter, 
   Jessica) into the jungle looking for ancient artifacts. Their guide, 
   Smith (Michel Banctel), has just stolen a fortune in diamonds from an 
   angry native tribe, so Albert chases him into the jungle to retrieve 
   the diamonds and return them to the tribe. The natives kill everyone 
   at Albert's base camp except for little Jessica, who they take back 
   to their village for human sacrifice. Meanwhile, Albert has caught up 
   with Smith and a gunfight erupts, where Smith is killed and falls off 
   a cliff with the diamonds and a seriously injured Albert stumbles 
   into the jungle crying out for his wife and daughter. When the witch

    (Peter O'Brian) to guide them to the diamonds, unaware that evil 
   Dutch businessman Nick (Didier Hamel) wants the diary. Nick's men 
   kidnap Lola, which leads to a car chase where Peter and John crash 
   their car and Peter chases them on foot to a train station (where a 
   small gun battle erupts), but the bad guys get away with Lola. Nick 
   forces Lola to lead him and his men to the treasure (he drags her 
   behind a canoe in crocodile-infested waters until she agrees), but 
   Peter and John are just a couple of steps behind them (Peter and John 
   watch in the bushes as two cannibals cripple one of their own and let 
   a leopard feed on him). Lola escapes from Nick when he and his men 
   are captured by a headhunting cannibal tribe and brought to their 
   village. Peter and John find Lola and they continue on their 
   destination to the diamonds, while the cannibals begin decapitating 
   and devouring Nick's mates (Nick avoids the same fate by showing the 
   cannibals how to use pistols and shotguns!). After taking an 
   unexpected ride over a waterfall, another tribe of natives captures 
   Peter, John and Lola, the same tribe now presided over by a 
   fully-grown Jessica, who is now called Mozizi. After Peter cures one 
   of the tribe's sick children, Mozizi (who is now a blonde and buxom 
   woman) takes a shine to Peter, which upsets tribal member Mogos 
   (Advent Bangun; <B><A HREF="#HungrySnakeWoman">THE HUNGRY SNAKE WOMAN</A></B>

   battle to the death between Peter and Mogos, which ends with neither 
   dying and Peter marrying Mozizi in a native ceremony. The honeymoon 
   is short-lived when Nick and the cannibals invade the village with 
   Mogos' help. This leads to a final battle between Peter and Mogos 
   (there will be a death this time), while John and Nick fight it out 
   next to a cursed pool containing a fortune in diamonds and jewels.

    the &quot;headhunters&quot; are nothing but peaceful locals working 
   in cahoots with Captain Yankee to fleece the rich and influential 
   into believing that they are stealing rare and invaluable ancient 
   artifacts. Yes, Captain Yankee is your classic con man and his next 
   mark is pretty socialite Maria Janez (Marina Costa), whom he rescues 
   from an attempted kidnapping, but Maria is well aware of his 
   reputation and slaps him across the face, thinking that the 
   kidnapping was his work. It wasn't, of course, as Maria is wanted by 
   Tiger (Protacio Dee), the leader of the Borneo Pirates, who is 
   working in conjunction with bad guy Da Silva (Rene Abadeza), because 
   Maria and her partner, Professor Lansky (Mike Monty), have a diary 
   that will lead them to the legendary Ruby Of Gloom. Captain Yankee 
   and Gin Fizz get themselves involved when crooked Inspector Warren 
   (Lee Van Cleef) blackmails them to lead Maria and the Professor 
   through the jungle to find the ruby. They are not alone in the 
   jungle, as Tiger and Da Silva have sent pirates to follow and kill 
   them once they have found the ruby. And what is Inspector Warren's 
   interest in this case and why does he break someone out of prison for 
   as yet unknown reasons? Could it have something to do with the ruby? 
   These questions will be answered as Captain Yankee leads his motley 
   group into the belly of a live volcano (a required staple in these 
   films) that is full of hidden passageways, contains a lake of fire 
   and is protected by an ancient masked race called the Guardians. Once 
   the ruby is found, the Professor turns out to be a traitor on Tiger's 
   payroll and he steals the ruby, only to be rewarded by being beheaded 
   by Tiger. Captain Yankee, Gin Fizz and Maria try to steal the ruby 
   back and it leads them to Tiger's secret ammo depot, which ends in an 
   explosive finale abetted by Inspector Warren (who is dressed to look

    The film opens as a series of comic strip panels, where a mysterious 
   man hires private investigator J.J. to save the life of a woman named 
   Gim, the man telling J.J. that she will be murdered within 24 hours 
   by a serial killer who took the life of another woman in 1965 (This 
   film seems to take place in the future at some unspecified year). 
   J.J. accepts the assignment even though the mysterious man doesn't 
   explain how he knows all this. The film then switches to live action, 
   where the camera is facing J.J. (Marcos Mart&iacute;) as he is 
   running down a dirt road. We then see an unnamed Professor (Antonio

   turns off the tape recorder, telling the Professor that she is 
   leaving him, but he pays her no mind, even when she walks out the

   certain spot in the city with as little personal property as 
   possible, so they can be picked up and transported out of the city 
   (some unknown catastrophe has happened, which is referred to as 
   &#147;collective fear&#148;). Gim spurns all their advances and 
   continues walking quickly, but she bumps into a blind man who 
   whispers in her ear, &quot;You are going to die today&quot;, which 
   really spooks her. She arrives at the house of her best friend, 
   Alvaro (Alberto Dalbes; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hunchback Morgue">THE
    HUNCHBACK OF THE MORGUE</A></B> - 1972), and tells him that someone 
   punctured the tires on her car, so she had to walk here, also telling 
   him what the blind man said to her. Alvaro tries to calm her down, 
   but his lover, Miriam (Mariane Benet), hates Gim because she takes up 
   too much of Alvaro's time for her liking She also believes that 
   Alvaro loves Gim more that he does her (She's right on both counts). 
   Miriam's husband Jerry, a sculptor of some very odd and unique 
   pieces, has disappeared without a trace, something he has done 
   before. There's a room in Alvaro's house devoted to Jerry's 
   sculptures and Miriam plays with with a piece shaped like a fish that 
   has a spring-loaded sharp metal spike that comes out of its mouth 
   (like a switchblade). She angrily stares at Gim while playing with it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Gim is a famous advertising model (which Teresa Gimpera was before 
   she became an actress) whose billboards are all over the city. We 
   watch a group of male teens walk up to one of those billboards, climb 
   a ladder and use an electric jigsaw (with a very long electrical 
   extension cord!) to cut Gim's image off it. They then carry the large 
   image to the auditorium where the Professor is about to give his 
   lecture; the teens nailing Gim's image to a wall facing the audience. 
   Yes, Gim's image is used as the face of a born victim, but just who 
   is her born killer? After the Professor is done with his lecture, he 
   goes to his dressing room and covers his face and hands in white 
   bandages (Looking like Claude Rains in <B><A HREF="invisible_man_1933.htm">THE
    INVISIBLE MAN</A></B> [1933]!). He then meets J.J. in the middle of 
   an empty soccer stadium and gives him some important information on 
   where to find Gim, revealing himself to be the man who hired J.J. in 
   the film's opening comic strip panels.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Gim gets back to her apartment, she believes someone&nbsp; has 
   been there and becomes very frightened. She phone Alvaro and pleads 
   for him to come over immediately, which he does, pissing off Miriam 
   even more (While Gim is waiting for Alvaro to arrive, she turns on 
   the TV, but only gets static, a running theme throughout the film, 
   proving that something quite catastrophic has happened in Barcelona, 
   if not to the whole of Spain [or even further]). When Alvaro arrives, 
   he professes his love for Gim and asks her if she feels the same way. 
   She looks at Alvaro and says, &quot;I don't love you, but I need 
   you.&quot; While that would depress most people, Alvaro seems okay 
   with that statement, as &quot;love&quot; and &quot;need&quot; mean 
   the same thing to him. When Alvaro returns home, Miriam is missing 
   and, more importantly, so is the spiked fish sculpture. So, do you 
   think you have it all figured out? Will J.J. save Gim in time or will 
   he fail? And just who is Gim's intended killer?&nbsp; All the clues 
   are in this review if you read it very carefully, but I will tell you 
   this: Two people will die by the spiked fish.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Remember in the '80s when a forensic scientist stated that people 
   with an extra &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y' chromosome (I can't remember 
   which one it was <A HREF="left-handed_fate_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/left-handed fate spain ad mat2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>and
    I'm too lazy a bastard to look it up) will most likely end up being 
   a serial killer? Even though that was quickly proven false, this film 
   plays with that fear over twenty years earlier and does it in such a 
   way that it becomes almost believable, even if we all know better (at 
   least I hope we do, but in today's society you can never tell!). 
   That's all thanks to Vicente Aranda's insightful direction and the 
   cutting screenplay, co-written by Aranda and Gonzalo Suarez (<B><A HREF="bloodbath_1979.htm">BLOODBATH</A></B> 
   - 1979), based on Suarez's original story. While this film has a 
   dream-like, almost nightmarish, quality to it (some portions of the 
   film are non-linear, but fairly easy to understand), especially the 
   unknown &#147;collective fear&#148; catastrophe, those looking for 
   concrete answers are bound to be disappointed, but those who are 
   willing to just go along for the ride will find much enjoyment, even 
   in the little things, such as Gim at one of her photo shoots, where 
   the female photographer tells Gim to make up the words to 
   Shakespeare's &quot;To live, perchance to dream&quot; soliloquy when 
   Gim tells her she can't remember what comes next. What Gim says next 
   tells us more about her character than ten pages of dialogue could 
   ever convey. It's little scenes like this that make the film so 
   special, especially since it is Vicente Aranda's first film as sole 
   director. Nearly all of his films have this quality to them, which is 
   why Aranda was considered one of Spain's most highly-regarded 
   directors (He passed away in 2015 at the age of 88). Hey, I'm not a 
   big arthouse film fan (I find most of them pretentious), but when 
   it's got a quality quite unlike any other film out there, I have to 
   admire it. And I admire this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    OF THE LOST ARK</A></B> (1981), but that's not really fair to 
   Chinese audiences because the character of Wisely predates Indiana 
   Jones by many, many years. The film opens with a Nepal monk placing a 
   baby next to the legendary Dragon Pearl somewhere in a secret temple 
   location. A ray of sunlight from a hole in the ceiling hits the 
   Dragon Pearl and it levitates and grows, looking like something alien 
   in origin. We then switch to somewhere in the Egyptian desert, where 
   a phony David Ko tries to sell a fake Dragon Pearl to the mysterious 
   Harry Hope (Bruce Baron; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#CruelHorizon1989">CRUEL
    HORIZON</A></B> - 1989), but Harry isn't falling for it. The fake 
   David Ko pulls out a pistol and empties a clip into Harry with no 
   effect and the imposter Ko spontaneously bursts into flames and dies.

    studies life in Egypt (he is standing next to a pyramid and 
   photographing a lizard). He believes that ancient advanced 
   civilizations were visited by extraterrestrials, who shared their 
   knowledge (like how to build perfect pyramids) with humans in 
   exchange for something that is not yet known. Enter Harry Hope and 
   his female assistant (Heidi Makenin). He asks Wisely if he knows 
   where his good friend David Ko (director Teddy Robin Kwan) may be, 
   but since Harry doesn't give Wisely a good reason why he wants the 
   information, he drives away in his Jeep and heads to his hotel, 
   leaving Harry holding his dick (not literally!). Once at the hotel, 
   Wisely receives a letter from David telling him to come to Nepal. 
   David's father spent half his life looking for the Dragon Pearl and 
   when he died, David took over the search. Wisely pilots his own plane 
   to Nepal and meets good friend David, who tells him he has found the 
   location of the Dragon Pearl, but it is in a mountain village in the 
   possession of an evil cult of religious monks. Since the Dragon Pearl 
   may be the evidence Wisely is looking for that validates 
   extraterrestrials visited humans in ancient times, he will do 
   anything to get his hands on it. Unfortunately, the mysterious Harry 
   Hope (who can best be described as a Howard Hughes-like recluse with 
   evil supernatural powers) also wants the Pearl, only his reasons are 
   not scientific. It seems David is quite the con man and fakes his own 
   kidnapping to give Wisely that extra &quot;push&quot; to find the 
   Pearl before Harry does. Wisely disguises himself as one of the evil 
   monks, but his ruse is quickly discovered, leading to a lengthy 
   martial arts fight, as Wisely takes-on all the monks single-handedly, 
   while David suddenly appears and steals the Dragon Pearl from the 
   &quot;Little Master&quot; (the slightly older baby boy from the 
   beginning of the film). The evil monks chase Wisely and David through 
   the mountains, but they are able to escape in Wisely's plane. The 
   Dragon Pearl makes the plane's instrumentation go wacky and Wisely 
   bails out into a lake and watches the plane explode with David and 
   the Pearl on-board. A dejected Wisely returns to David's house, where 
   the Little Master and the evil monks are waiting for him. The Little 
   Master (who has ESP and can hear Wisely's thoughts), tells Wisely 
   that David is alive and has left the country with the Dragon Pearl. 
   Since the Little Master knows by reading his thoughts that Wisely is 
   a &quot;righteous&quot; man, he asks Wisely for his help in 
   retrieving the Pearl and returning it to the temple (the Pearl gives 
   those that possess it supernatural powers) and Wisely agrees (seems 
   the monks aren't so evil after all). Wisely goes to his yacht in Hong 
   Kong, where Harry's female assistant tells him that the Dragon Pearl 
   use to belong to Harry's ancestors and he is willing to pay an 
   exorbitant amount of money to get it back. Since Wisely has all the 
   money he needs and he's a good guy, he declines the offer and with 
   the help of Sue Pak (Joi Wang), a martial arts master and the sister 
   of Pak Kei-Wei (Ti Lung; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic1975">BLACK
    MAGIC</A></B> - 1975), an associate of David's, tries to get the 
   Dragon Pearl back and return it to Little Master. It's going to be a 
   dangerous trip frought with many obstacles and booby-traps.&nbsp; 
   Diminutive director Teddy Robin Kwan (<B><A HREF="shanghai_shanghai_1990.htm">SHANGHAI
    SHANGHAI</A></B> - 1990) and producer Samuel Hui make a pretty good 
   comical on-screen duo and it's easy to see why this was a big hit in 
   Hong Kong and Mainland China, with sumptuous on-location 
   cinematography in Egypt and Nepal, plenty of martial arts fights, car 
   crashes and stunts (not to mention the evil American baddie). Yet, 
   while watching it, there seemed to be something missing from the film 
   that just didn't satisfy my action and fantasy sensibilities. While 
   there is plenty of derring-do and some great action set-pieces, not 
   once did I fear that Wisely, David or Sue were in any danger of 
   losing their lives. I realize that this is a 
   fantasy/action/sci-f/comedy, but for all those times they are shot 
   at, chased or forced to fight using both their hands and feet, not 
   once did I ever feel any of them would be killed. Call me 
   old-fashioned, but I like my danger to have an element of death 
   involved (not to mention some blood and guts, but this seems to have 
   been made as a &quot;family friendly&quot; flick), but <B><A HREF="legend_of_wisely_1986b.htm">THE
    LEGEND OF WISELY</A></B> has none of that. It's good for what it is, 
   but it could have been so much better if they made it just a smidgen 
   more adult-oriented. I will give it this, though: The finale is 
   certainly unique and explains why the Chinese believe in dragons.

   sold his soul to the Devil for immortality, but in order to stop him

   local Burgomeister (John Karlsen; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SlaughterHotel1971">SLAUGHTER
    HOTEL</A></B> - 1971) tells her to put her hands on the Bible and 
   say she is not a witch, pledging herself to God, she does, only the 
   Bible catches on fire! She is immediately branded a witch and is to 
   be burned at the stake in a few days, but Maciste promises Charley 
   and Martha that it will never happen. The village's friendly doctor 
   (Charles Fawcett; <B><A HREF="death_ray_of_dr_mabuse_1964.htm">THE 
   DEATH RAY OF DR. MABUSE</A></B> - 1964) tells Maciste about the 
   legend of the Witch's Tree, so he decides to uproot it, but when he 
   does, it opens a doorway to Hell, which Maciste enters (the tree then 
   goes upright as if it were never toppled over). Maciste must then 
   traverse Hell so he can destroy witch Martha Gaunt, who watches him 
   battle various obstacles and barriers with Judge Parris by her side 
   (She was right about him joining her in Hell). As Maciste wins every 
   obstacle put before him, he then meets the lovely Fania 
   (H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Chanel; <B><A HREF="gangsters_law_1969.htm">GANGSTER'S
    LAW</A></B> - 1969), who heals his burned hands and promises to help 
   him in his quest to defeat Martha, but she's really there to do the 
   exact opposite, giving him an apple that makes him totally forget why 
   he is in Hell. Will Maciste regain his memory and defeat Martha? What 
   do you think?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While the plot may seem nothing but a clich&eacute;, it's the 
   presentation that will wow you. Forget how Maciste turns up in 17th 
   Century Scotland (!), since most peplums take place in the years 
   before Christ was born, and concentrate on the stunning visuals, 
   which are very Mario Bava-like in presentation (Reminding me of 
   Bava's <B><A HREF="#HerculesHauntWrld61">HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD</A></B> 
   - 1961). The depictions of Hell are very strong for a film made in 
   1962, as we see hundreds of people suffering eternal fates such as 
   cannibalism, trying to push a heavy boulder&nbsp; up a hill, being 
   whipped and other atrocities [I even caught a quick bit of female 
   nudity!). The fire effects are also very eerily atmospheric, 
   including a scene where fire seems to follow Maciste with every step 
   he takes. Director Riccardo Freda (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DevilsCommandment57">THE
    DEVIL'S COMMANDMENT</A></B> - 1957; <B><A HREF="giants_of_thessaly_1960.htm">THE

    CEREMONY</A></B> - 1972; and many others), under his nom-de-plume of 
   &quot;Robert Hampton&quot;, uses the screenplay (by Oreste Biancoli 
   [Freda's <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ghost1963">THE GHOST</A></B> 
   - 1963] and Piero Pierotti [<B><A HREF="erik_the_conqueror_1961.htm">ERIK
    THE CONQUEROR</A></B> - 1961]) to good effect, as Hell is a place 
   where anything could happen and it usually does. There's a very 
   unintentionally funny scene where Maciste must battle the giant 
   Goliath (Pietro Ceccarelli; <B><A HREF="throne_of_fire_1983.htm">THE 
   THRONE OF FIRE</A></B> - 1983) and whenever Maciste and the giant are 
   shown together in the same frame, it is obvious that Maciste is 
   portrayed by a young boy in a rubber muscle suit in order to make 
   Goliath seem much bigger than he actually is! But that's just a minor 
   complaint compared to the rest of the film, which is very adult in 
   themes of love, hate, mass hysteria and trying to cheat the Devil 
   (who never appears in the film!). It is also fairly accurate to Greek 
   mythology, as Maciste meets Prometheus (Remo De Angelis; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#GetMean1975">GET
    MEAN</A></B> - 1975) in Hell. He is chained to a boulder as vultures 
   feed on his entrails. Maciste defeats one of the giant vultures 
   (Apparently, there are a lot of animals in Hell, as Maciste also 
   fights a lion and a herd of stampeding steer!) and unchains 
   Prometheus, who tells him what Fania has done to him and to remember 
   why he is here. When Maciste regains his memory (by watching footage 
   from his previous films in a puddle of <A HREF="witchs_curse_1962.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/witch's curse poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="387" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>water,
    Prometheus showing him how he helped the masses, where Morris 
   suddenly transforms into Gordon Scott in one segment!) and goes to 
   thank him, he finds Prometheus chained to the boulder as vultures 
   once again feed on his innards, giving us an example of what an 
   eternity of suffering really is.&nbsp; It turns out Fania is actually 
   Martha Gaunt and she falls in love with Maciste, ending her curse 
   (the tree catches on fire just as the innocent Martha and Charley 
   (Who doesn't want to live without his wife. Now that's dedication!) 
   are being burned at the stake, but a heavy rain begins to fall, 
   putting out the flames and proving that Martha is not a witch (and 
   also bringing all the captive young women to their senses). This 
   genre-bending fantasy is perfect for people who don't care about the 
   '60s Peplum genre (I don't care for them, which is why none are 
   reviewed on this site), because the Gothic horror elements shine 
   through. I have to say that this may be one of Riccardo's Freda's 
   large body of works that I enjoyed the most, as nearly all his '60s 
   Gothic horror films were very good to excellent to begin with. Give 
   it a try, you may like it, papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; boulders and all 
   (and there are a lot of 'em)!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1988), an unusual black comedy that won critical appraisal. Mary

   a marriage proposal from James (Stephen Blake)<A HREF="mad_at_the_moon_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mad at the moon.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="140" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   after being spurned by James' half-brother Miller (Hart Bochner), 
   whom Mary really loves. Mary refuses to make love to James. As a 
   matter of fact, she won't even let him touch her. One morning she 
   discovers James boarding up the windows. He tells her to stay in the 
   house, lock the door behind him and not to let him in no matter what 
   he says or does. It seems James suffers from &quot;moon 
   sickness&quot;, a disease that causes him to go crazy like a wolf 
   when the moon is full. When Mary experiences James' mental 
   transformation (the physical transformation is minimal), she becomes 
   terrified and moves back to town. Her mother (Fionnula Flanagan) 
   strikes up a bargain with Miller: He is to stay with Mary at James' 
   house that one day a month the moon is full to serve as her 
   protector. This leads to much sexual tension between the three 
   parties. The finale shows that the love of a good woman can cure what 
   ails you. This is a slow-moving (it crawls sometimes), though 
   atmospheric, period film. Donovan photographs the film using the 
   natural light available, giving the film a realistic tone. The sexual 
   angle is also realistic for the time period. Back then, it was a 
   woman's place to stay with her husband no matter what the problem (If

   unthinkable to get a divorce. A bullet in the head would have been a

   (Jason Pai Piao; <B><A HREF="brutal_sorcery_1986.htm">BRUTAL SORCERY</A></B> 
   - 1984) flies to Borneo by helicopter, grabs a few native guides and 
   heads into the jungle to search for his uncle, who was carrying a 
   fortune in jewels on the plane. They run into a tribe of lepers and 
   the guides run away in fear, forcing Lin Wen Ying to kill a few of 
   the attacking lepers with his shotgun. It turns out that their 
   leprosy was caused by a magic curse put on them by high priest 
   Abdullah and only death by an outsider will release the curse (One of 
   the dying lepers reverts back to his normal human form, tells Lin Wen 
   Ying the whole story and then begs for one final shotgun blast to 
   finish him off, which Lin obliges). Abdullah is the high priest of 
   the Snake Tribe, who periodically sacrifice nubile young virgins to 
   the Snake God, while their priestess, Filona (Pinky DeLeon), watches 
   unapprovingly. Abdullah has the hots for virgin tribal girl Sophia 
   and when he sees that she is about to lose her cherry to tribe member 
   Chow Ming, he performs a magic ritual where Sophia turns into a 
   vampire and bites off Chow Ming's penis, killing him (Just as she 
   bites it off, the camera switches to a tribe member peeping on the 
   couple as he bites into a banana!). Lin Wen Ying witnesses Sop<A HREF="magic_curse_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/magic curse dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>hia
    committing suicide after waking up from her trance and seeing what 
   she has done, so he runs over to her and all she says is 
   &quot;Abdullah!&quot; before she dies (To which Lin replies, &quot;Him
    again?&quot;). When Lin asks members of the Snake Tribe if they have 
   seen his uncle and the jewels, he gets an arrow in his shoulder for 
   his troubles. He escapes and is found unconscious by Filona and some 
   handmaidens (who we see frolicking buck-naked in a pond with some 
   surprising full-frontal nudity), she nurses him back to health and 
   they fall in love. Now here is where it gets weird. Filona tells Lin 
   that the Snake Tribe witnessed his uncle's plane crash and Abdullah 
   stole the jewels from his uncle's corpse. Filona, who doesn't approve 
   of Abdullah's magic or his virgin sacrifices, shields Lin from 
   Abdullah, but once Abdullah finds out Filona is in love with Lin, he 
   fashions a voodoo doll from Lin's pillowcase (!) and puts a magic 
   curse on him, which Filona counters using her magic powers. Lin 
   leaves the jungle and promises to come back, but just to make sure he 
   does, Filona puts a magic curse on his lips, telling him if he kisses 
   any other girls while he is away, they will die a horrible death and 
   he must return to the jungle within a year to marry her. This leads 
   to a whole lot of trouble for Lin once he returns to civilization and 
   it's best left to the viewers to witness for themselves. Needless to 
   say, Lin forgets about his promise to Filona rather quickly (What do 
   you want? He's a man!), which leads to death, destruction and plenty 
   of snakes. Will Lin learn to keep it in his pants before more women 
   meet their maker in horrible fashions?&nbsp;&nbsp; This Hong Kong 
   Production (partially filmed in the Philippines), co-directed and 
   co-written by Tommy Loo-Chung (actually Lu Chin Ku; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#BlackDragon1974">THE
    BLACK DRAGON</A></B> [1974] and <B><A HREF="tiger_over_wall_1980.htm">TIGER

    TATTOO CONNECTION</A></B> [1978]), is a crazy combination of fantasy 
   and martial arts genres with plenty of fighting, gore and nudity. 
   While not as outrageous as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic1975">BLACK
    MAGIC</A></B> (1975), you have to give points to <B><A HREF="magic_curse_1977c.htm">MAGIC
    CURSE</A></B> for making Lin such a horndog, even though he knows 
   there's a curse on his lips. He picks up women at bars and parties, 
   beds them immediately and then the women die horribly shortly 
   thereafter (they hallucinate they are being attacked by hordes of 
   snakes, making them die from fright, heart attack or falling down a 
   staircase). Lin simply moves on to the next woman, telling himself 
   that their deaths were merely coincidences! Particularly hilarious is 
   that during these lovemaking sessions, brassy lounge or jazz music 
   plays on the soundtrack, which makes it sound like some cheap porn 
   film. The plot of the film is all over the place, opening up in a 
   bowling alley, then switching to the jungles of Borneo (the bloodiest 
   section of the film; with human sacrifices, stabbings, impalements, 
   bloody magic rituals and, of course, the penis-biting), then back to 
   civilization and, finally, back to the jungle again, where a cop 
   returns with Lin to make sure his story about magic curses is true. 
   The finale, where Filona battles Abdullah (who walks around carrying 
   a staff with a human skull attached at the top), contains fireballs, 
   snakes and a funny shot where Abdullah catches a huge (and obviously 
   Styrofoam) boulder right in the chest. As usual, this is a worthwhile 
   Hong Kong effort for those who know what to expect from these kind of 
   films: Non-stop craziness with a sense of the absurd. Also starring 
   Peter Chen Lau, Tan Chia Bee, Mong Hu, Woung Eune Em, Nam Soon Joung, 
   Hwang Kun Chi and Choi Mu Ung. Never legitimately available on home

   Quirky and outlandish supernatural fantasy from the Philippines that 
   is full of strange characters and wild set designs. Circus magician 
   Professor Jamir (Michael DeMesa) performs the same magic trick that 
   he does every night in front of an audience: He makes his young 
   daughter Freza (Sunshine) disappear from a wooden trunk and then 
   reappear in a puff of smoke. Only this time, when the puff of smoke 
   comes, his daughter is nowhere to be found. Not knowing where his 
   daughter went, Jamir brings his assistants, wife Lovina (Tanya Gomez) 
   and young chubby boy Bojok (Tom Tom), to a prophet named Ahura (Turko 
   Cervantes) to discover just where Freza went. Ahura uses his black 
   magic talents (which includes cutting the head off a live monkey and 
   making the trio taste it's brains before Ahura slurps it down in one 
   gulp!) to locate Freza and begins talking in Freza's voice saying. 
   &quot;Daddy, Mommy, save me!&quot; Lamir, Lovina and Bojok then 
   travel to the next town to perform his magic act (Hey, the show must 
   go on!), but when Jamir performs a magic trick involving swords (to a 
   very sparse, unappreciative audience), all three disappear into the 
   same netherworld as Freza, yet only Lovina is reunited with her 
   daughter while Jamir and Bojok must go on a long, arduous trek to 
   save them. Lovina and Freza a<A HREF="magic_of_the_universe_counter_destroyer_dvd_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/magic of the universe-counter destroyer dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="321" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>re
    being kept in a cage by the evil, big pulsating-foreheaded&nbsp; 
   Mikula (Armida Siguion-Reyna), an old hag that was cursed by Jamir's 
   grandfather Lolo Omar (also played by DeMesa) to live eternally and 
   never experience the pleasure of bearing children. Mikula has 
   kidnapped Freza and Lovina to lure Jamir, the last male in his family 
   line, into a trap to kill him and lift the curse. Lolo Omar appears 
   as a ghost to warn his grandson about the troubles ahead and tells 
   Jamir that the medallion he wears around his neck (a gift from his 
   deceased father) will protect him and begin to glow when he is near 
   the &quot;Regalia&quot;, an object Jamir will need to defeat Mikula. 
   As Jamir and Bojok search for the Regalia, they will encounter many 
   weird characters on their trip, some who want to help them and some 
   who were sent by Mikula to stop them. Jamir and Bojok are captured by 
   a tribe of pigmy cannibals (It just wouldn't be a Filipino film 
   without dwarves, would it?), but Jamir astounds them with his magic 
   tricks and they become friends. Bojok steps into the woods to take a 
   shit and is captured by Mikula's ogres (giant pig-faced creatures 
   with horns in the middle of their foreheads), who imprisons him with 
   Lovina and Freza. Jamir is now on his own, as Mikula and her 
   menagerie of monsters party and dance in a cave (in a scene that 
   defies description; try imagining the <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR
    WARS</A></B> cantina scene as seen through the eyes of a junkie 
   going through withdrawal). Bojok is forced to fight a sharp-clawed 
   female demon while Mikula watches, which affords Lovina and Frenza 
   time to escape. Will Jamir find the Regalia in time to save his 
   family and destroy Mikula? Will I ever stop being amazed by these 
   Filipino fantasies? I hope not!&nbsp; While nothing more than a 
   twisted take-off of Alice In Wonderland, director Tata Esteban (<B><A HREF="alapaap_1984.htm">ALAPAAP</A></B> 
   - 1984; a.k.a. <B><A HREF="clouds_1984.htm">CLOUDS</A></B>) and 
   scripter Grace Hill Serrano add so much looniness, strange creatures 
   and superb set designs (Mikula's lair is an amazing amalgam of 
   colorful lighting, fog and inventive designs) to make this a trip 
   worth taking. While this is indeed a fantasy, this is not a film for 
   children's eyes, since monkey brain-eating, bloody deaths and intense 
   situations (including child endangerment and cannibalism) runs 
   rampant here. Particularly effective is the sequence where the 
   escaped Lovina and Freza&nbsp; are saved from a swamp creature (Ricky 
   Sujede) by Arbutus (Filipino film staple Dick Isreal) and brought 
   back to his camp, where he introduces them to his wife, Madera 
   (Odette Khan), who is slowly being turned to stone by a curse place 
   on her by Mikula. When Mikula recaptures Lovina and Freza, she 
   punishes Arbutus by speeding-up Madera's curse. It's very unpleasant 
   to watch, but very effective. There are also many strange creature 
   effects on view, including the rubbery Globo (imaging the floating 
   head in <B><A HREF="invaders_from_mars_1953.htm">INVADERS FROM MARS</A></B> 
   [1953] on a $1.99 budget), who acts like Mikula's crystal ball, and 
   other assorted monsters (Mikula herself, with her incredible 
   throbbing brain, is an incredible sight), most played by actors and 
   stuntmen in full body makeup, store-bought costumes or latex masks. 
   There's also plenty of optical work, including laser beams shooting 
   out of people's eyes; the Regalia (nothing but a magic wand with a 
   tassle attached to it!) shooting electrical charges into Mikula's 
   head (making it explode); as well as an explosive finale. How come 
   fantasies like this are never made in the U.S.? I think out child 
   labor laws play a big part with it. Also known as <B><A HREF="monster_of_the_universe_1987.htm">MONSTER

   containing a poisonous snake and only one person will survive. Phil 
   wins the bet but, unfortunately, is arrested before he can collect <A HREF="mark_of_the_scorpion_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mark of the scorpion vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>and
    is carted off to prison. Phil was formerly the leader of &quot;The 
   Scorpions&quot;, a group of freedom fighters who, besides Phil, have 
   all been killed (The police captain shows Phil his collection of 
   scorpion tattoos, all cut from the bodies of Phil's dead comrades!). 
   The sickly prison warden, Fontaine (Paul Muller; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY
    FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971), makes a deal with Phil: If he can find 
   the fabled &quot;Cleopatra's Treasure&quot;, he will pardon Phil as 
   well as split the treasure 50/50. Phil agrees to the deal and, 
   together with fellow prisoner Johnson (Danilo Mattei; a.k.a. 
   &quot;Brian Redford&quot; of <B><A HREF="cannibal_ferox_1981.htm">CANNIBAL
    FEROX</A></B> - 1981), sets off on a journey to find the treasure, 
   with sadistic guard Sergeant Kemal (Mohamed Attifi), an old enemy of 
   Phil's, dogging their every move. Did I forget to mention that Phil 
   and Johnson never have to leave the prison to find the treasure? It 
   seems it's located somewhere in a mine located directly beneath the 
   prison. Phil manages to con Warden Fontaine into furloughing him to 
   collect more info on the location of the treasure (and some scuba 
   gear), but the warden manages to slip Phil some slow-acting poison to 
   make sure he returns within twelve hours to receive the antidote. 
   When Warden Fontaine suddenly dies and Sergeant Kemal takes over (he 
   begins shooting prisoners in the back for no reason at all), Phil and 
   Johnson must find the treasure and escape the prison before Kemal and 
   his flunkies flush them out. If you were like me, you would have quit 
   caring about 90 minutes ago.&nbsp; This little-seen action adventure 
   contains a lot of bloody violence, including dismemberments, 
   stabbings, shootings, bloody ball-grabbing and even force-feeding a 
   man a live rat (!), yet the film still manages to be an exercise in 
   tedium. Director/co-scripter Massimo Pirri (<B><A HREF="fatal_fix_1980.htm">FATAL
    FIX</A></B> - 1980) manages to mishandle every opportunity at action 
   and suspense, always zigging when he should have zagged (not to 
   mention continually betraying the 1936 time period, especially the 
   distinctly 1980's Jeep that Phil uses in his twelve hour furlough 
   from prison). The main problem, though, is the character of Sergeant 
   Kemal. He thoroughly makes Phil's life in prison a living hell, even 
   after Phil agrees to help Warden Fontaine locate the treasure. It 
   seems to me that all of Kemal's savagery could have been stopped 
   immediately if Phil would have just mentioned it to Fontaine. If you 
   like treasure hunting movies, you're in for a disappointment here, 
   because the search for Cleopatra's Treasure is saved for the film's 
   final fifteen minutes and contains some of the lamest boobytraps ever 
   committed to the screen. A five year-old could spot them a mile away. 
   These are not the life-threatening traps that we would expect from 
   the likes of Cleopatra (I had to laugh when a single stalagmite falls 
   and Phil says to Johnson, &quot;That old girl really knew her 
   traps!&quot;). It should come as no surprise that Cleopatra's 
   Treasure is encased in a object that looks exactly like the Ark of 
   the Covenant in <B>RAIDERS</B> and when Phil opens it, all it 
   contains is a scroll (which immediately blows out of his hands) and a 
   single gold object. Jeez, that Cleopatra is one stingy bitch! The 
   majority of this film is nothing more than a tepid prison drama with 
   plenty of overt homosexual subtext. Save your valuable time and pass 
   this one by. Also starring Dannys Cole, Milly D'Abbraccio, Abdelsalam 
   Sadoo, Leslie Thomas, Calogero Caruana and Antonio Scarano. Released

   There's not enough ice in the world to cover-up the stink that is <B>THE
    MASTER DEMON</B>. Scientists will be dissecting this film for 
   decades to come in hopes of trying to figure out how to remove that 
   awful smell that oozes out of VCR and DVD players once unknowing 
   viewers press the &quot;Play&quot; button on their remotes. Gallons 
   of tomato juice will be used with no effect, thousands of cans of 
   Lysol will give up and call it a day and millions of Ziploc bags will 
   retreat like the French Army. Will anything stop this stench? Our 
   only hope may be to collect every copy of this film and bury them in 
   a mile-deep hole at the center of the Arctic ice caps (right next to <B><A HREF="blob_1958.htm">THE
    BLOB</A></B>), but God only knows if doing that would cause the 
   Earth to tilt off its axis and destroy mankind. Yes, <B>THE MASTER DEMON</B> 
   is that bad, making shit films like <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SamuraiCop">SAMURAI
    COP</A></B> (1991) seem like a breath of fresh air. The film begins 
   with an epic battle (if epic battles were poorly photographed martial 
   arts fights filmed by a crackhead holding a camera) between the White 
   Warrior (producer Eric Lee in a ridiculous white wig) and the Master 
   Demon (Gerald Okamura; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Cage21994">CAGE II</A></B> 
   - 1994), where a mortally wounded White Warrior cuts off one of the 
   Master Demon's hands and stumbles off with it, delivering it to a 
   bald monk who performs a ritual over it and sticks it in a box, while 
   an offscreen<A HREF="master_demon_1988_1996.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/master demon vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   narrator tells us the world will be safe as long as the Master Demon 
   doesn't find his hand and reattach it to his body (I've simplified 
   the narrator's comments because he spouts nonsense that they wouldn't 
   even put in fortune cookies). Cut to the present, where Tong Lee 
   (Eric Lee again) wakes up from a bad nightmare and finds the White 
   Warrior's &quot;Sword of the Furious&quot; impaled (and smoking) on 
   his front lawn. He picks it up and is instantly appointed the savior 
   of the Earth. We the switch over to a museum next to the La Brea Tar 
   Pits (actually the George C. Page Museum, but I doubt they would lend 
   their name to this film), where Chinese philanthropist Qua Chang 
   (Gerald Okamura again) donates the box with the Master Demon's hand 
   as an exhibit for permanent display, only to have it stolen and 
   fenced for $1,500. Qua Chang summons evil spirit Medusa (female 
   bodybuilder Kay Baxter Young, who died in a car crash in 1988, 
   shortly after principal photography of this film ended) to retrieve 
   the box and, after snapping Qua Chang's neck for disturbing her 
   restful slumber (!), she goes about killing everyone who touches the 
   box, beginning with the thief (who also gets his neck snapped). The 
   black miniskirt-wearing Medusa then goes after Link The Fence (Bob 
   Roberts), but he manages to escape (with a huge knife impaled in the 
   middle of his forehead, courtesy of Medusa) and hands the box (Ha! A 
   play on words!) to private dick Cameron Massey (Steve Nave) before he 
   dies (All Cameron can say is, &quot;How am I going to get these 
   stains out of this rug?&quot;). Medusa soon appears to take control 
   of the box, but before she can kill Cameron with her squad of ghostly 
   (and badly made-up) kung-fu fighters, Tong Lee crashes through a 
   window and defeats them all (in hilariously inept fashion), while 
   Medusa disappears with the dismembered hand and rejoins it to the 
   body of the Master Demon. Cameron (who cracks a <B><A HREF="beast_with_five_fingers_1946.htm">BEAST
    WITH FIVE FINGERS</A></B> [1946] joke) joins forces with Tong Lee 
   and police detective Wayne Bersecker (Sid Campbell) to get to the 
   bottom of all this nonsense, while the Master Demon, Medusa and an 
   army of martial arts fighters with black shoe polish on their faces 
   try to kill them, especially Tong Lee, who is now the reincarnated 
   spirit of the White Warrior. What follows next are some of the lamest 
   martial arts fights in Grade Z film history (making the fight scenes 
   in <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#RobotNinja">ROBOT NINJA</A></B> 
   look like <B><A HREF="enter_the_dragon_1973b.htm">ENTER THE DRAGON</A></B> 
   in comparison), mixed with humor even a drooling retard wouldn't find 
   funny. This epic piece of crap was co-directed by Sherman Oaks 
   Experimental College film instructor Samuel Oldham (who also wrote 
   the screenplay), who shot the film proper in 1988, and stunt/fight 
   coordinator Art Camacho (who also directed such Pepin/Merhi 
   productions such as <B><A HREF="power_within_1995.htm">THE POWER WITHIN</A></B> 
   [1995] and <B><A HREF="recoil_1998.htm">RECOIL</A></B> [1998], as 
   well as such recent actioners like <B><A HREF="soft_target_2006.htm">SOFT
    TARGET</A></B> [2006] and <B><A HREF="half_past_dead_2_2007.htm">HALF
    PAST DEAD 2</A></B> [2007]), who added some narration and extra 
   fight scenes in 1996 for its official home video release. This film 
   has all the earmarks of an ultra-cheap production, including: bad 
   sound recording; hilarious post-synch dubbing (where we not only hear 
   the characters' thoughts, we also hear plenty of &quot;Oh, shit!&quot;
    remarks whenever our heroic trio are attacked); a music score that 
   sounds like it was recorded on a Casio keyboard; dialogue that 
   harkens back to the Charlie Chan films of the 30's &amp; 40's 
   (&quot;Silence, you son of a white dog!&quot;); some extremely cheap 
   gore (including torturing a man with an electric drill to his 
   testicles and then ripping-off his face and eating it!); and dozens 
   of martial arts fights that could have been performed better by a 
   bunch of pre-teens in their backyard with a super 8mm camera. Add all 
   this together and what you have is either one of the worst martial 
   arts/horror films ever released on home video or one of the biggest 
   put-ons in film history. I'm leaning towards the former. <B><A HREF="master_demon_1988_1996b.htm">THE
    MASTER DEMON</A></B> is so bad, it crosses the line from awful to 
   demented entertainment. Bad film fans should eat this one up. Also

   something about the plot of the film (and it's a doozy!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A worried Dani (Florence Pugh; <B><A HREF="falling_2014.htm">THE FALLING</A></B> 
   - 2014) is reading an email sent by her sister<A HREF="midsommar_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/midsommar amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Terri and becomes instantly worried. The email reads: <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I
    can't anymore - everything's black - mom and dad are coming too. goodbye.&quot;</FONT></B> 
   Dani calls boyfriend of four years, Christian (Jack Reynor; <B><A HREF="kin_2018.htm">KIN</A></B> 
   - 2018), to tell him that she is worried about Terri because she 
   emailed her three times and she didn't answer a single one of them. 
   It's obvious that Dani and Christian's relationship is troubled, 
   because he tells Dani that she's in &quot;crisis mode&quot; again and 
   she gets that way for no reason at all. After hanging up the phone, 
   we see Christian is having dinner with his male friends at a 
   restaurant. They try to get Christian to dump Dani, telling him that 
   she's too needy and she takes up most of his time, sometimes over 
   nothing at all. Christian won't do it, telling his friends he loves 
   Dani, but it is plain to see that the notion has crossed his mind 
   more than once. Dani then phones him once again, only this time she 
   is crying so loud, it sounds like she is screaming. Turns out Terri 
   and her parents are dead, the victims of a devastating automobile 
   accident, which may have been caused by Terri. Dani is inconsolable, 
   so Christian takes care of her. A short time later, Dani and 
   Christian go to a party, where she learns Christian is going to 
   Sweden in two weeks with his friends and she knew nothing about it. 
   Dani gets into a &quot;discussion&quot; with Christian, guilting him 
   into inviting her to go with him to Sweden, thinking she will not go. 
   However, Dani decides to go, which pisses off Christian's male 
   friends, but Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who was raised in a commune in 
   Sweden, is surprisingly okay with it. He wants to return to his 
   Hargas commune in Sweden in time for the Midsommar Festival, a 
   ritualistic ceremony that involves......hold it, this is way too soon 
   to reveal!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once in Sweden, Pelle introduces the group to a few members of his 
   commune, including his brother Ingemar (Hampus Hallberg). It seems 
   other members of the commune have also brought strangers to the 
   commune, which includes Londoners Connie (Ellora Torchia) and Simon 
   (Archie Madekwe). Christian's insecure friend Mark (Will Poulter; <B><A HREF="maze_runner_2014.htm">THE
    MAZE RUNNER</A></B> - 2014) wonders why it is still light out at 
   10:30 PM and Pelle tells him this is normal for Sweden; it's called 
   the &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;. Mark says he &quot;doesn't like&quot; 
   this, it makes him very uncomfortable, but Pelle tells him not to 
   worry, his body will adapt to the lack of darkness quickly (it never 
   gets fully dark this time of the year). It's rather obvious that Dani 
   suffers from some deep psychological problems (she's studying 
   psychology in college, but the college gave her a semester off to 
   deal with her family's death), as she tells Christian that members of 
   the commune are laughing at her. Are they? The next day, Pelle takes 
   his friends to meet the leader of the commune, Father Odd (Mats 
   Blomgren). He shakes the hands of all the males and hugs Dani, 
   telling her he is glad she is here to celebrate the &quot;Hargas 
   tribute to Ymir and her hermaphrodite qualities&quot;, also saying to 
   everyone that Pelle has &quot;an immaculate sense for people.&quot; 
   The commune leads a very spartan, almost pioneer-like existence (but 
   they do watch DVDs!), wearing matching white frocks and doing 
   everything (and I mean everything!) together. Everyone watches as 
   Ingemar welcomes all the strangers to the commune and wishing them a 
   happy Midsommar. He says it has been 90 years since their last great 
   feast and it will be 90 years before their next. It's also the 
   hottest and brightest Summer on record. He then tells everyone to 
   raise their glasses and toast the commencement of the nine-day feast. 
   As they drink, Dani and the rest of the group find the taste rather 
   odd. And why are some members of the commune severely deformed? Could 
   incest be involved?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We also learn that it's Dani's birthday and Christian has forgotten 
   about it, but not Pelle, who hands Dani a hand-drawn portrait of her 
   as a birthday present. Pelle takes his friends on a tour of the 
   commune, where large stone runes mark the borders of the commune, 
   there's a large live bear in a small wooden cage (you won't believe 
   what the bear is used for!) and there's a large yellow wooden 
   teepee-like structure, which Pelle says no one is allowed to enter. 
   Pelle also says that the commune celebrates age like the four 
   seasons. From when you are born until you are 18, you are a child 
   (Spring). From the age of 18 until 36, you go on your Pilgrimage 
   (Summer). From ages 36 to 54, you are of working age (Fall). And From 
   ages 54 to 72, you are a Mentor (Winter, but Pelle never says it). 
   When Dani asks what happens when you are older than 72, Pelle 
   jokingly runs his hand quickly across his neck, as if to say 
   &quot;death&quot;, but is he actually joking? The group will actually 
   witness such an event very shortly. While taking the group on a tour 
   of the communal building where everyone sleeps together until they 
   turn 36, Dani notices a wall full of photos of young women wearing 
   flower crowns and asks Pelle if they were the May Queen. Pelle tells 
   her she will be around when they choose the new one. Every Midsommar, 
   the commune holds a dance competition where the winner is crowned the 
   May Queen. Pelle tells everyone that they will, too, sleep in this 
   communal structure (The building has black shutters which block out 
   the sunlight).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, Dani and her group take part in a ritual near the 
   yellow teepee-like structure, where everyone silently wait for an 
   elderly man and woman to walk out of the structure to sit at the 
   tables arranged in an unusual pattern and eat a meal (a kind of Last 
   Supper, as it were). The two elderly members take turns talking 
   Swedish while the other chants, which results in everyone raising 
   their glasses to them. The elderly woman is carried away on her chair 
   (like Cleopatra) and everyone gathers at the bottom of a cliff, 
   looking up and smiling. The elderly woman appears at the top of the 
   cliff and jumps off, her body smashing face-first to the altar-like 
   rock below (there's a scene where they show her body and her face is 
   missing!), The elderly man has the palms of his hands slit open and 
   rubs his blood over a large stone rune with strange symbols carved 
   into it. He then appears at the top of the cliff and jumps off, but 
   he doesn't die (One of his legs has snapped off at the knee and lies 
   beside him!). The group of communal spectators begin to moan out loud 
   when they see the elderly gentleman isn't dead, so a member of the 
   commune walks over to him and smashes his head in with a ceremonial 
   long hammer! Dani and the rest of the group stand there in shock as 
   they watch other members take turns caving-in the old man's head with 
   the hammer (nothing is left to the imagination). Connie and Simon try 
   to leave the commune (Simon yells out, &quot;This is fucked!&quot;), 
   only to be told by a female member that this is a great joy for the 
   victims, as this is the end of their &quot;life cycle&quot; and the 
   next two babies born in the commune will bear their names so they'll 
   never be forgotten. If Dani was having psychological problems (She 
   has bouts of crying fits which she makes sure no one else sees), 
   imagine what she is feeling now. Christian, after seeing the two 
   elderly people taking their own lives, decides to do his college 
   thesis on the ancient practices of the Hargas commune, knowing full 
   well that his friend Josh (William Jackson Harper; <B><A HREF="they_remain_2018.htm">THEY
    REMAIN</A></B> - 2018) came to Sweden to do the same exact thing. 
   They become instant enemies. Dani wants to leave the commune, but 
   Pelle talks her out of it, telling her that she needs a &quot;real 
   family&quot; and this commune can offer her that, something that 
   Christian can't offer her (As he is saying this, we watch as the 
   mutilated corpses of the two elderly people are incinerated in a fire).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Pelle's sister Maja (Isabelle Grill) leaves a love rune under 
   Christian's bed, so Pelle tells him that's it's permitted if he has 
   sex with her. Connie is disappointed when Father Odd tells her that 
   Simon has left the commune without her, something Dani refuses to 
   believe and tries to discover the truth. As you can see, the commune 
   is basically tearing friendships and relationships apart, especially 
   when Christian has a total disconnect from Dani and seems more 
   interested getting it on with Maja. Fuck-up and serial complainer 
   Mark urinates on the &quot;Sacred Tree&quot;, which pisses off all 
   the members of the commune. Christian and Josh become bitter enemies 
   over their separate theses. And did Dani put her pubic hair in the 
   meat pie she baked for Christian or did Maja put it there so she could<A HREF="midsommar_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/midsommar poster22c small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   have communal sex with him (a scene you need to see to believe!)? If 
   you want to know what happens next, you are going to have to watch 
   the film yourself. Who will live and who will die&nbsp; and what 
   bloody, graphic manner will they meet their deaths? Believe me, 
   you'll have to have a strong stomach to survive this. Be prepared to 
   be shocked and surprised. I certainly was.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Slow-moving, but never boring, this film runs 147 minutes, but I 
   guarantee you will never be watching the clock, because this film 
   offers a plethora of visual treats, many you have never witnessed 
   before. I especially like that our heroine, Dani, is a 
   far-from-perfect human being and it's refreshing to watch a 
   nearly-broken person try to repair her life while going through 
   things she has never experienced before at the commune. Like most 
   cults, this commune works very hard to tear away a person's 
   personality and identity, making them as vanilla as the next member. 
   If they don't succeed, that person must die, but they die in ways you 
   will find hard to believe, but you will never question it, because it 
   is the commune's longstanding beliefs that dictates the manner of 
   their deaths. The dance competition to crown the new May Queen is a 
   thing of absolute beauty and terror; a combination marathon dance 
   mixed with musical chairs, in which Dani comes up the winner and is 
   made to wear&nbsp; a large crown of colorful flowers (It gets much 
   larger as the film comes to its conclusion!). But what role does the 
   May Queen play in the Midsommar Festival? Half the fun of watching 
   this film is picking up the clues which explains to us what Dani's 
   pre-determined fate is to be. The other half is the shocking, bloody 
   and very graphic ways people die in this film. It had to be submitted 
   to the MPAA three times before they would give it an R-Rating. 
   Director/screenwriter Ari Aster also released a nearly three-hour 
   &quot;Director's Cut&quot;, which restores all the gore he had to cut 
   out before the MPAA would give him a rating that was acceptable to 
   the releasing studio (A24). It quite hard to imagine what he had to 
   remove from the film in its present state, when it is shocking to the 
   extreme, but I hope to get my hands on the uncut version very soon to 
   see what I was missing. It's hard to believe that this is only Ari 
   Aster's second film as a director, as he shows a sure, steady hand 
   here, much like a director of numerous films, but be assured that he 
   has a style he can call his very own.&nbsp; So, is this my favorite 
   film of 2019? I really can't tell you that since I have only seen a 
   handful of films from that year, but I will tell you this: Did the 
   ending of a film ever leave you tingling inside? You know the 
   feeling, when it feels like goosebumps are forming from the soles of 
   your feet and traveling quickly to the top of your head, leaving you 
   in a quite emotional state? That's what this film did to me. I also 
   guarantee that you will never listen to Frankie Valli's &quot;The Sun 
   Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)&quot; the same way again. Available on a <A HREF="midsommar_2019.htm#DVD&amp;Blu-RayComboPak">Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital

    MINES OF KILIMANJARO</A><A NAME="Mines Kilimanjaro"></A> (1986) -</B> 
   Another Italian knock-off of <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS
    OF THE LOST ARK</A></B>, also set during the rise of the Nazi 
   empire. When Professor Thomas Smith (a badly-dubbed Christopher 
   Connelly) is murdered by a blond-haired German with a gun hidden in a 
   cane, it leads the Professor's associate, Dr. Ed Barkley (Tobias 
   Hoesl), on a trip halfway around the world to Africa, where he 
   searches for &quot;The Secret of Africa&quot;, a hidden area on Mt. 
   Kilimanjaro filled with diamonds that is guarded by a tribe of 
   headhunters. While in Mombasa, Dr. Barkley is kidnapped by Chinese 
   crimelord Ti-Ling, who threatens him with torture (he watches as 
   Ti-Ling's men force feed a prisoner live mice through a funnel) if he 
   doesn't reveal the location of the diamonds. Dr. Barkley is saved 
   from certain doom by Dutchman Rolf (Gordon Mitchell) and agrees to 
   lead a safari through the jungles of Africa to look for the <A HREF="mines_of_kilimanjaro_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mines of kilimanjaro vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>diamonds.
    Along on the safari is Eva Kilbrook (Elena Pompei), who seems to be 
   looking for more than the diamonds. After some badly-edited stock 
   footage of African wildlife (it's very obvious, as the film stocks 
   don't match), the group camps out for the night and someone tries to 
   kill Dr. Barkley, but fails. They do manage to kill all the porters 
   and guides, though, as Dr. Barkley and Eva are captured by the 
   Leopard Men, a tribe of cannibals. They eventually escape and, for 
   some unknown reason (to me, anyway), Rolf and Ti-Ling join forces and 
   are looking for Dr. Barkley, but manage to miss him at nearly every 
   turn. The blond-haired Nazi is also on the trail, keeping an eye on 
   the action at a safe distance (he obviously knows something we don't 
   know). Dr. Barkley (who is wounded by a poison arrow) and Eva are 
   then rescued by a group of black-robed monks who have a photograph 
   that was taken in 1917. It shows that the late Prof. Smith was once a 
   German soldier who ventured to the Secret of Africa and actually 
   found it. Now, Dr. Barkley and Eva will retrace Prof. Smith's steps 
   to Mt. Kilimanjaro. They meet an all-female tribe, headed by The 
   Empress (Francesca Ferre), who wants Dr. Barkley's seed so they can 
   replenish the tribe. More hijinks and deaths follow to the unexciting 
   conclusion.&nbsp; Highly racist to the extreme (the Chinese are 
   portrayed by white actors who say &quot;ahh-so!&quot; and can't 
   pronounce their &quot;r&quot;s) as well as offensive to all of Africa 
   (all blacks are portrayed as cowards or bloodthirsty cannibals), 
   director/screenwriter Mino Guerrini (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#ThirdEye1966">THE
    THIRD EYE</A></B> - 1966) can't seem to make up his mind if he wants 
   to make an adventure film like <B>RAIDERS</B> or a gore film in the 
   vein of <B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST</A></B>.
    While there is gore present (a hand chopped off, arrow piercings, a 
   bat impaled on a hook), it's apparent some of the more extreme gore 
   has been edited out, such as when the Leopard Men draw-and-quarter a 
   fellow native or when Ti-Ling force feeds a prisoner live mice. The 
   dubbing is also highly dubious (only Gordon Mitchell seems to have 
   redubbed his own voice) and there's some glaring mistakes in the 
   timeline, such as when a 1980's Land Rover can be spotted in what is 
   supposed to be 1930's Africa. None of it is the least bit exciting 
   (it's all rather statically filmed) and the reveal in the finale (the 
   Nazis have occupied The Secret of Africa for the past 15 years and 
   have been mining the diamonds to finance the Nazi cause) is one of 
   the lamest surprises I have ever witnessed. German TV star Tobias 
   Hoesl makes a bland and emotionless hero (He's no Harrison Ford. 
   Hell, he's no David Warbeck!) and there's no nudity, not even any 
   topless natives. What's an African adventure without topless natives?

   was acquired by Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Films, who then proceeded to 
   re-edit the film to fit within the &quot;Troma Universe&quot;, adding 
   a stupid post-credit sequence (where the Tromaville sign is 
   prominently displayed and footage from <B><A HREF="tromas_war_1988.htm">TROMA'S
    WAR</A></B> [1988] is inserted) and lame female voiceover narration 
   to justify Troma's new, ridiculously long title (the original title 
   was <B>DARK FORTRESS</B>). Thankfully, most of Piper's film remains 
   intact; an ultra-low-budget remix of <B><A HREF="teenage_caveman_1958.htm">TEENAGE

    effects, full-size mock-ups and forced perspective photography. 
   After a devastating worldwide nuclear holocaust (at least that's how 
   it is explained in Troma's re-edited version), the survivors have 
   resorted back to their barbarian, almost caveman-like, ways; some 
   turning to cannibalism, some becoming mutants and household pets and 
   other animals and insects turning into gigantic mutated creatures. In 
   this dangerous new world, we meet the bikini-clad Lea (Linda Corwin), 
   who seems to be the only pretty, non-infected woman in the territory, 
   so she naturally is desired by every male with a working penis, both 
   normal and infected. She is saved from being raped by a bunch of 
   Neanderthals led by Marn (Paul Guzzi), so they join forces to 
   survive. When Lea is captured by a tribe of cannibal mutants led by 
   Clon (co-producer Alex Pirnie) and Marn is seriously wounded, an old 
   man who calls himself a &quot;Digger&quot; (K. Alan Hodder) nurses 
   Marn back to health and gives him an old gun to help in his search 
   for Lea. Meanwhile, Lea is saved from Clon by a mask-wearing, 
   white-haired stranger (Mark Deshaies), who teaches her to read (using 
   old childrens books) and gives her a Bic lighter (!) to start 
   campfires. The masked stranger (whose real face is nothing but a 
   burned skull) is soon killed by Clon after a long, drawn-out fight 
   and Lea is recaptured (she proves herself quite useless and 
   ineffective when trying to defend herself, which makes me wonder how 
   she lasted this long!), but she is saved when a giant worm erupts out 
   of the ground (Like in <B><A HREF="dune_1984.htm">DUNE</A></B>, only 
   much cheaper, but effective nonetheless) and bites off Clon's arm (in 
   one of the film's few gore scenes). Lea battles a giant flying 
   monster and ends up in a cave full of the flying critters (who sleep 
   hanging upside down like bats), while Marn fights a swamp creature 
   (Pirnie again in a rather good rubber monster suit) and learns Lea's 
   location from the mortally wounded masked stranger. Will Lea and Marn 
   find each other before the pissed-off, one-armed Clon turns Lea into 
   &quot;lizard meat&quot; by feeding her to the creatures he keeps in a 
   pit?&nbsp; This dialogue-light flick (I doubt there is more than two 
   pages of spoken words in the entire script if you discount the 
   tacked-on Troma prologue) fails miserably as a sci-fi fantasy, but 
   Brett Piper's stop-motion and full-sized creature effects are, as 
   always, fascinating to watch because, no matter how cheesy-looking 
   and low-rent in appearance they are, at least Piper took the time to 
   do them the old fashioned way, preferring not to use CGI or dress 
   real lizards with fake fins and film them on miniature sets. You can 
   tell that most of Piper's matte effects and other photographic tricks 
   were done in-camera without the help of post-production work, which 
   gives this film a definite 50's feel. Too bad the storyline is so 
   generic (there is only one instance of female nudity and it comes at 
   the very end), but the numerous creatures and effects work will keep 
   monster fans fairly entertained. Piper still prefers old-style 
   effects up to this day, which make most of his films, no matter how 
   hackneyed storywise, a treat for those with Harryhausen and Danforth 
   tastes. Also starring Russ Greene, Rick Stewart, Scott Ferro and Ryan 
   Piper. Available on VHS and DVD from <A HREF="http://www.troma.com">Troma

   Infectious low-budget fantasy adventure from the prolific Fred Olen 
   Ray, which plays like a condensed version of the serials from the 
   30's &amp; 40's, only with more gore and female flesh. The film opens 
   with a couple (and their dog) on a picnic being attacked by a 
   ridiculously fake-looking monster, who disembowels the dog and rips 
   off the guy's head before the girl kills it by beaning it over the 
   head with a cooler. A woman named Danae Chambers (Susan Stokey; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#StarSlammer1986">STAR
    SLAMMER</A></B> - 1986) hires Cort Eastman (Ross Hagen; <B><A HREF="alienator_1989.htm">ALIENATOR</A></B>

   explore the cave that the monster came out of because she believes, 
   based on the fortune in unpolished jewels the monster was wearing 
   around it's neck, that it came from the fabled lost city of R'Lyla. 
   After obtaining a map of R'Lyla from Bill (Russ Tamblyn in a cameo), 
   the only person known to actually have seen R'Lyla and live to tell 
   about it (he ended up losing a leg, though), Cort, Eddy, Danae,

    bedding down for the night, the group are interrupted from their 
   drinking and carousing by the sudden appearance of a mute babe in a 
   bikini (Michelle Bauer; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Tomb Werewolf">TOMB
    OF THE WEREWOLF</A></B> - 2003) who is being chased by a bunch of 
   mutated cannibals. They save the mute babe, but Danae is kidnapped by 
   the cannibals, who tie her to a spit and begin slow-roasting her over 
   a fire (She screams, &quot;You won't like how I taste!&quot;). Cort, 
   Eddy and Andrew save her and the mute babe then leads the group to 
   the entrance of her city (which is guarded by a laser-firing Robby 
   The Robot from <B><A HREF="forbidden_planet_1956.htm">FORBIDDEN PLANET</A></B>!).
    The city happens to be (surprise!) the lost civilization of R'Lyla 
   and they are met at the entrance by the Alien Queen (Sybil Danning [<B><A HREF="tomb_1986.htm">THE
    TOMB</A></B> - 1986] in a tight, bra-busting outfit) who, along with 
   her tribe of all-female bikini-clad mutes, takes everyone prisoner. 
   It seems the Alien Queen crash-landed there years ago and needs our 
   motley group to mine the caves as slaves to retrieve the materials 
   needed to repair her ship. She also has the hots for Andrew, but the 
   mute girl he saved also like him, which sets up the conflict that 
   will help our group escape in the finale. After finding diamonds that 
   will make them rich beyond their wildest dreams, they steal the Alien 
   Queen's rocket car and successfully make it back to civilization, 
   with the Alien Queen vowing revenge in a sequel that was never 
   made.&nbsp; While cheap to the point of poverty (the cannibals wear 
   static rubber masks and there's dinosaur footage cribbed from <B><A HREF="planet_of_dinosaurs_1978.htm">PLANET
    OF DINOSAURS</A></B> [1978]), director Fred Olen Ray (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeepSpace">DEEP
    SPACE</A></B> - 1987), working with a screenplay written by himself 
   and T.L. Lankford, has infused the film with a sense of playfulness 
   and humor (He reportedly shot this film in six days and it shows). 
   Nothing is taken seriously, as no one is killed (besides the mutant 
   cannibals) after the poor picnic guy is beheaded in the beginning. 
   Most of the film is one bad burlesque joke after another, but Ray 
   realizes this and plays the entire film as pure camp. The special 
   effects (the ones that weren't borrowed from other films) are 
   laughable but seem to be done that way on purpose to keep the spirit 
   of the serial adventure films of the past (the forced perspective 
   shots are a hoot, as is the <B><A HREF="flash_gordon_serials_1930s.htm">FLASH
    GORDON</A></B>-style rocket car the Alien Queen uses to travel 
   through R'Lyla). The nudity is saved for the final third of the film, 
   where we get to see Sybil Danning's exposed nipple when she gets into 
   a fight with Ross Hagen and then Michelle Bauer trots around topless 
   for a couple of minutes after getting into a catfight with one of her 
   tribe members. The gore, on the other hand, comes in the beginning of 
   the film with the extremely graphic beheading. The rest of the 
   violence is strictly comic book level; just bloodless gunfights, a 
   mutant being disintegrated by Robby The Robot's laser blasts and an 
   explosion in the finale. <B><A HREF="phantom_empire_1987c.htm">THE 
   PHANTOM EMPIRE</A></B> is just goofy, mindless fun from beginning to 
   end. Mr. Ray promised a sequel during the end credits, but it never 
   materialized. This is basically a remake of the 1935 Gene Autrey 
   12-part serial with the same name. Made in 1987, but not released 
   until 1989. Also starring Michael D. Sonye (the scripter of <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BloodDiner1987">BLOOD

   During a Muslim wedding, someone puts the bride under a black magic

   a rotting zombie and her flower necklace is turning into a snake, 
   which puts a serious crimp in the wedding ceremony. It also doesn't

   a storm blows in from nowhere. The bride becomes a complete basket 
   case (she imagines that snakes are everywhere) and the wedding is 
   canceled. This all seems to benefit local peasant girl Murni 
   (Suzzanna; <B><A HREF="#SnakeQueen">THE SNAKE QUEEN</A></B> - 1982), 
   who was madly in love with the groom, Kohar, before he callously 
   dumped her and decided the marry the daughter of a wealthy 
   businessman. When the local witch doctor is mysteriously killed by 
   some supernatural magic (his body is repeatedly slammed to the ground 
   by some invisible force), he utters in his final breath, &quot;The 
   evil spirit comes from the west!&quot; Kohar interprets this to mean 
   that Murni is responsible, so he gathers all the townspeople to hunt 
   down Murni (The only thing Murni is really responsible for is losing 
   her virginity to Kohar, who promised to marry her after he popped her 
   cherry). Kohar and the villagers capture Murni, burn down her house 
   (killing her mother in the process) and drag her to the top of a 
   mountain, where they throw her off a cliff 
   (&quot;One...two...three...away!&quot;). Luckily, Murni lands in the 
   arms of a black magician (W.D. Mochtar), who nurses her back to 
   health and teaches her the finer points of the Black Arts. Murni 
   becomes the Queen of Black Magic and uses her newfound powers to 
   avenge her mother's death and make all those responsible pay with 
   their lives, especially the dastardly Kohar. Pretty soon, villagers 
   are being attacked by bees; breaking out in huge boils that explode 
   in huge gushers of blood; swallowed under the ground and devoured by 
   snakes; hung from trees by the neck; and, in one case, Murni steals 
   an infant out of a cradle and breast feeds it, getting a huge sexual 
   thrill from the experience! The appearance of a stranger in town 
   named Permana may be just what the villagers need to battle Murni and 
   her teacher. After Murni kills Kohar, she wants to stop the reign of 
   terror, but her teacher won't let her (it's apparent he has an 
   agenda). Things get weird when Murn<A HREF="queen_of_black_magic_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/queen of black magic indonesian poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>i
    and Permana fall in love, not knowing each other's true identities. 
   As Permana gets the villagers to accept religion back into their 
   lives, which lessens the black magician's powers, one villager spots 
   Permana cavorting with Murni in the forest. Mistakenly thinking that 
   Permana is in league with the Devil, the villagers may undo 
   everything good Permana has brought into the village.&nbsp; This is 
   another wild and delirious fantasy film from Rapi Films, Indonesia's 
   premiere supplier of filmed dementia. This is a sort-of second sequel 
   to the 1975 Hong Kong horror film <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic1975">BLACK
    MAGIC</A></B> (1975) and <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic2">BLACK

   Imam Tantowi (<B><A HREF="#WarriorAndNinja">THE WARRIOR AND NINJA</A></B> 
   - 1985) give this film it's own unique spin, mixing religion and 
   black magic as a metaphor for good against evil. This film is full of 
   weird visuals, such as when the silhouette of Murni can be seen 
   flying through the air (with the obvious help of a trampoline) 
   against the backdrop of a full moon; Murni using black magic to force 
   Kohar to rip off his own head (!) and then the head flies through the 
   air biting villagers; the black magician's use of a voodoo doll to 
   make the rich businessman's stomach swell-up to gigantic proportions; 
   and the final attack on the village, where an unjustly deceived Murni 
   and Permana face-off and family secrets are revealed. Expect 
   fireballs, flying objects, toe-sucking and other strange sights. 
   There's a lot of blood spilled here and a few shots of semi-nudity as 
   Indonesian films tend to shy away from showing women's nipples. Even 
   in the breast-feeding scene, we see the baby suckling on Murni's 
   breast, but no nipple, yet this film finds clever ways to cover-up 
   the naughty bits, by use of strategically-placed objects, blurred 
   lenses or camera framing, making the viewer believe they are seeing 
   more than they actually are. <B><A HREF="queen_of_black_magic_1979d.htm">QUEEN

   (1980). Two mercenaries (the late Chris Connelly and Tony King)

   wave in the Pacific ocean. It seems the scientists were trying to 
   raise a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine which is resting on what was

   the inhabitants thirsty to kill any humans they come in contact with. 
   Connelly and the group try to stay one step ahead of the 
   Atlantidians, occaisonally meeting them head-to-head for some bloody

   Atlantis the ruler of the world. They succeed and Atlantis once again 
   sinks to the depths of the ocean. Accomplishing this feat has cost 
   many lives. Who will survive? This filmed in the Philippines 
   fantasy/actioner boasts some over-the-top effects (including a 
   decapitation by electrical wire and an arrow in the mouth) and nice 
   scenery, but the storyline is so confusing (especially in the finale) 
   that you'll be scratching your head wondering what the hell it's all 
   about. Another problem is the tendency to introduce new characters 
   throughout the film just to have them killed off a few minutes later. 
   Director Ruggero Deodato shows a sure hand in filming the action 
   sequences but fumbles when it comes to the scenes that are strictly 
   dialogue. The Italian screenwriters have a way of writing dialogue 
   that murders the English language, especially when it comes to 
   writing &quot;hip&quot; dialogue for black characters. Watch Lamberto

   (the single-monikered Nadiuska), whom the townspeople chased out of 
   town for being a witch. Frank and Roger (who are amateur 
   parapsychologists) go to Maria's deserted house and discover ancient 
   Aztec symbols on the walls (they cannot be seen with the naked eye 
   and can only be viewed when photographed) and record voices on tape 
   that weren't heard originally. They finally locate Maria living in a 
   mountain cabin with her father (director M.I. Bonns, using his first 
   two names Miquel Iglesias). There they learn that Maria has strange 
   supernatural powers. When her drunken father tries to rape her, 
   windows mysteriously break and objects fly around. Maria cures a 
   young boy's gangriene-infected leg. She has visions of Spanish 
   Conquistadors. While under hypnosis, we learn that Maria is possessed 
   by the Princess of Moctezuma, an ancient Aztec ruler whose people 
   were slaughtered by the Conquistadors. The Princess was taken captive 
   and fell in love with one of her captors. Maria's father goes crazy 
   and burns down the cabin with himself and Maria in it. Frank and 
   Roger find Maria's dead, but unburnt, body among the cinders. On 
   their flight back to France, Frank and Roger discover that all their 
   evidence has been erased. The photos and tapes have gone blank. 
   Suddenly, they are approached by a stewardess who bears a striking

    The film begins with the new footage, that pretty much has nothing 
   to do with the original film. The Caribbean Sea 1891: Captain Decker 
   (Cameron Mitchell; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SatansSupper1980">SATAN'S

   notedly <B><A HREF="it_conquered_the_world_1956.htm">IT CONQUERED THE WORLD</A></B>

   take Radcliffe (Mel Ferrer; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EatenAlive1980">EATEN

   the &quot;Cave Of The Dead&quot;, where they hope to find treasure 
   (To revitalize the Radcliffe family fortune, which was gambled away). 
   Decker and his crew stop at the mouth of the cave, Decker telling the 
   couple that they can go inside and find the treasure on their own 
   becasuse he was only paid to point them to the cave. They should have 
   gone in because a sharp-clawed sea creature is decimating Decker and 
   his crew. Crew member Patterson (Tom J. Delaney) has his head gorily 
   ripped-off his body and Decker has his throat torn out. It's not so 
   pleasant inside the cave, either, as Radcliffe also has his throat 
   torn out and when one of the corpses guarding the treasure rises and 
   attacks Samantha, she runs out of the cave and into the arms of the 
   creature (which looks like a rejiggered version of one of the <B><A HREF="humanoids_from_the_deep_1980.htm">HUMANOIDS

    Then the film proper begins. Five survivors of a prison ship 
   shipwreck, doctor Lt. Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MurderRock">MURDER-ROCK:
    DANCING DEATH</A></B> - 1984) and prisoners Jose (Franco Iavarone), 
   Peter (Roberto Posse), Fran&ccedil;ois (Francesco Mazzieri) &amp; 
   Skip (Giuseppe Castellano; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BirdCrystalPlum1970">THE
    BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE</A></B> - 1970) wash-up on the shore 
   of an uncharted volcanic island. Almost immediately, they are 
   attacked by fishmen (they hide in the mud of shallow water), killing 
   Fran&ccedil;ois and Skip. The trio continue traveling inland, where 
   they find a deserted village. Jose thinks this island stinks of 
   voodoo because he sees empty graves and symbols that signify such. 
   They meet a beautiful woman on horseback named Amanda Marvin (Barbara 
   Bach; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BlackBellyTarantula">BLACK 
   BELLY OF THE TARANTULA</A></B> - 1971), who tells them to get off the 
   island because it belongs to Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightChild1975">THE
    NIGHT CHILD</A></B> - 1975). Instead of heeding her warning, they 
   follow her back to where she lives, unaware that they are being 
   followed by Rackham. They meet Rackham and he invites Claude to have 
   dinner with him and Amanda (Jose and Peter were not invited). At 
   dinner, Radcliffe makes it clear to Claude that he is master of the 
   island. That night, Peter follows Amanda as she jumps on a horse and 
   heads out to shore. She is greeted by a bunch of fishmen, who don't 
   attack her. She gives them some sort of liquid to drink as they 
   gather around her and then they head out back to the ocean. Peter 
   tries to rape Amanda when she tries to return home, but she is saved 
   by one of the fishmen, who grabs Peter and drags him under water to 
   his death. The next morning, after hearing Rackham saying to Claude 
   that Peter is of &quot;no importance&quot; because he was a criminal, 
   Jose steals a horse and discovers a ship named the 
   &quot;Enterprise&quot; hidden from view in a cave. He boards the ship 
   and is knocked-out by Rackham. Claude tries to follow Jose and is 
   attacked by the fishmen, but Amanda saves his life by calling the 
   creatures off. Why does Amanda have powers that sway these creatures?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Faster than you can say &quot;Dr. Moreau&quot;, we are then 
   introduced to Amanda's father, Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph 
   Cotten; <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON BLOOD</A></B> - 
   1972), a world-reknown biologist that was long-thought dead. The 
   Professor suffers from spells that could lead to his death and the 
   only reason that Rackham keeps Claude alive is because he is a 
   doctor. He wants Claude to treat the Professor so he doesn't die, but 
   why? (We already know that Rackham has the hots for Amanda, but she 
   finds his romantic advances disgusting). Rackham makes it clear to 
   Claude that if he wants to live, he better keep the Professor alive. 
   When the Professor awakens, he tells Claude that he can't leave the 
   island for proper medical treatment&nbsp; because &quot;My work isn't 
   finished!&quot; Before Claude can get a proper answer to what kind of 
   work he is referring to, Rackham takes Claude to a secret underground 
   cave, where they travel underwater in an ancient diving bell. Rackham 
   shows Claude the underwater city of Atlantis, which is protected by a 
   swarm of fishmen. Rackham wants the treasures that Atlantis holds and 
   tells Claude that the Professor has created a potion that keeps the 
   fishmen in check (the same potion that Peter saw Amanda giving to the 
   fishmen). He wants Claude to keep &quot;the old man going&quot; and 
   is willing to share the treasure with him if he keeps the Professor 
   alive. Rackham plans on using the Enterprise to escape the island 
   once the treasure is in his possession and offers Claude a chance to 
   come with him. Claude agrees, but it is obvious that he wants nothing 
   to do with Rackham. Claude finds a way to get into the Professor's 
   secret laboratory, where he and Amanda discover that Jose is being 
   transformed into one of the fishmen (he looks like the spitting image 
   of <B><A HREF="creature_from_the_black_lagoon_1954.htm">THE CREATURE 
   FROM THE BLACK LAGOON</A></B> [1954]). Amanda had no idea that her 
   father was capable of such dastardly deeds (The Professor tells 
   Amanda that he has transformed many of the island's native residents 
   into fishmen). After this discovery, Rackham enters the laboratory 
   and shoots the Professor dead (he no longer has any more use of him). 
   Claude realizes that Rackham wants the fishmen to retrieve the 
   treasure for him since Atlantis is 2,000 feet underwater, much too 
   far a distance for normal humans (at the time) to travel.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rackham knocks-out Claude with the butt of his pistol and puts him 
   in an iron cage that is slowly filling up with water. He takes Amanda 
   prisoner, pointing his pistol at her head, telling the fishmen he 
   will kill her unless they bring the treasure to him. Instead, the 
   fishmen free Claude just as the island's volcano begins to erupt. 
   Claude saves Amanda after getting into a fight with Rackham and they 
   try to escape in the Enterprise, but not before Rackham tries to stop 
   them. He falls into the water and the fishmen drag him underwater. 
   The fishmen then grab Amanda, also dragging her underwater, with 
   Claude jumping in to save her, just as the lava destroys the the 
   island (and the Enterprise). Claude and Amanda wake up, floating on a 
   piece of the Enterprise as a ship approaches. The fishmen saved their 
   lives and Claude wonders if any of them are still alive. What do you think?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Scorpion Releasing released this on Blu-Ray (my review is based on

   talks about shooting the trailer (using sets from <B><A HREF="galaxy_of_terror_1981.htm">GALAXY

   after riots broke out in an Atlanta drive-in. It is funny as well as 
   informative. Also on the disc is an interview with Miller Drake, who 
   tells how he became to direct the new footage (Joe Dante recommended 
   him to Corman). He thought the creature that Chris Walas created in

   needed the new footage to make the film feature-length (that's simply 
   not true because the original version ran 94 minutes, where this new

   make the film more exploitable.), one with Joe Dante (who edited this

   in the air (Literally. The last time we see them, they are hanging on

   Gianfranco Parolini (<B><A HREF="yeti_1977.htm">YETI: GIANT OF THE

   Westerns of the 60's &amp; 70's), using his frequent &quot;Frank 
   Kramer&quot; pseudonym, is dumb fun if you try not to think too hard. 
   The dubbed English dialogue is about as juvenile as it gets 
   (especially when Bradbury has to suck poison out of Linda's ass), but 
   the goofy situations and violence (which escalates as the film 
   progresses) should keep most viewers reasonably entertained. At 
   first, the film plays like some family-friendly adventure tale, but 
   about the midway point it becomes quite violent, as people are 
   riddled with bullets, blown up, impaled through the neck and heart 
   with arrows, eaten by crocodiles, decapitated (one virgin girl has 
   her head cut off in an ancient ritual and her decapitated head is 
   attached to a rope and pulled to the top of a temple) or sliced open 
   with swords. Other weird sights on view include Max Laurel (<B><A HREF="zuma_1985.htm">ZUMA</A></B>

   Bradbury and Linda's final booby trapped excursion into the buried 
   underground city, where they are attacked by snakes, bats and 
   crocodiles that shoot laser beams from their mouths (!) and then meet 
   the sole protector of the lost city, who wears a huge metal condor 
   mask, shoots laser beams out of his eyes and plays an organ like he's 
   the Phantom of the Opera! Of course, none of it makes an ounce of

   (1983) -</B> In this comical post-nuke adventure (set in the Year 23, 
   After the Cancellation), merchants Tom (David Goss of <B><A HREF="action.htm#Hollywood Cop">HOLLYWOOD
    COP</A></B>) and Dick (Harrison Muller) go on many adventures 
   searching for Tom's sister Hari (Elena Wiedermann) after she is 
   kidnapped by the evil Hector (Gordon Mitchell) and his band of 
   mutants, known as the Norks. The only person who can help Tom and 
   Dick locate the Nork village is man-hater She (Sandahl Bergman), the 
   leader of an all-female tribe. She thinks men are only good for two 
   things: Sex and fighting to the death. Men who meet her in either 
   method always end up dead. She has sex with men and immediately kills 
   them once she has had her way with them. She also goes through a 
   yearly ritual where she fights a series of men (even a Frankenstein 
   monster whose head explodes when she bites off one of his neck 
   bolts!) and then takes a nude bath in a regeneration pool to heal her 
   wounds. Prophecy says she will give up her man-hating ways when she 
   falls in love with a man that will change her life. Tom and Dick 
   kidnap She to help them locate Tom's sister, but <A HREF="she_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/she 1983 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>immediately
    run into trouble when they are captured by chainsaw-wielding mutant 
   mummies led by Kram (Cyrus Elias). They are tossed into a giant trash 
   compactor, but are saved by She's all-female army. Surprisingly, She 
   let's Tom and Dick go on their way but secretly follows close behind. 
   She ends up saving Tom and Dick's ass when they run into a tribe of 
   mutant vampires dressed as Romans during the time of Caesar (they 
   wear cheap dimestore fangs and listen to 50's Doo-Wop music!). Next, 
   She, her second in command Shandra (Quin Kessler), Tom and Dick feel 
   the wrath of Godan (Gregory Snegoff), the telekenetic leader of a 
   group of axe-carrying monks, who whip She and Shandra before Tom and 
   Dick save them from certain deaths (including a painful 
   body-stretching for Shandra [Dick says to her, &quot;You look 
   taller!&quot;] and a psychic rape for She). Our fearless foursome 
   next trek through a forest that emits a toxic fog and She, Shandra 
   and Dick are taken prisoner by mad scientist Rabel (Donald Hodson) 
   and his pink tu-tu wearing brute henchman Rudolph (Mario Pedone). 
   They all manage to escape, make it to the Nork village and rescue 
   Tom's sister, but another problem arises: If they don't take a stand 
   now, the Norks will attack and wipe out She's people. They wait for 
   the Norks on a bridge and hope to hold-off the Norks long enough 
   until Shandra returns with reinforcements.&nbsp; This goofy, 
   off-the-wall fantasy adventure was directed and scripted by Israeli 
   director Avi Nesher (<B><A HREF="timebomb_1991.htm">TIMEBOMB</A></B> 
   - 1991; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Doppelganger">DOPPELGANGER</A></B> 
   - 1992) with his tongue firmly planted in cheek. Half the fun of 
   watching this film is spotting the frequent sight gags on view. I 
   especially enjoyed Tom's run-in with movie-quoting Xenon (David 
   Traylor) on a bridge that leads to the Nork village. Xenon is so 
   annoying, Tom chops him into pieces, but each piece turns into a 
   separate Xenon and soon Tom is fighting a dozen Xenons (who, at one 
   point, form a chorus line and high-step like the Rockettes!). There 
   are many more visual treats on view in <B><A HREF="she_1983c.htm">SHE</A></B> 
   (check out what's written on the boxes and crates during She's 
   fighting ritual and pay close attention to the costumes the Norks 
   wear) as well as imaginative (and funny) set pieces, including 
   Godan's psychokinetic fighting ability, Hector's &quot;Anyone wish to 
   withdraw&quot; speech and the Nork gladiator match in the finale. 
   There's surprisingly very little nudity (just Sandahl Bergman's 
   topless dip in the regeneration pool) and not much blood, although 
   there is plenty of violence, including impalements, dry 
   dismemberments (one arm-yanking scene is played strictly for laughs) 
   and explosions. Rather than having a pat, &quot;Happily ever 
   after&quot; ending, director Nesher chose to end it on a bittersweet 
   note, which is truly refreshing. This is a fun, campy time for those 
   looking for something a little off the beaten path. It's like <B><A HREF="wizard_of_oz.htm">THE

   &quot;Peggy Sanders&quot; of <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#LadyAvenger1988">LADY
    AVENGER</A></B> [1988] infamy) steals the Reverend Mother's DNA 
   formula (she's pregnant with a male child) and escapes into the 
   desert, the Reverend Mother puts a bounty on her head and orders 
   Cobalt to find her a living male subject so she can drain him of his

   &quot;Santrapper&quot; Phoenix (Kathleen Kinmont; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Art Dying">THE

   When Keela gives birth to the baby boy, which she names Skylar, The 
   Reverend Mother instantly has a psychic link to it, but she is once 
   again thwarted by Phoenix (They both share a past together). Five 
   years pass and Skylar is now a young boy who is trained by Phoenix to 
   be a great hunter. The trio search for safety in the legendary 
   &quot;Island In The Sea&quot;, but first they must walk through the 
   Badlands, a desolate area inhabited by the Rezule, a tribe of 
   TV-quoting mutants. When Skylar accidentally drops his toy car on 
   their journey and it is brought back to the Reverend Mother, she is 
   able to reconnect her psychic link to Skylar, so she sends Cobalt and 
   her crew in dune buggies to capture him. The trio is helped by Guy 
   (James H. Emery), the last living adult male (who escaped from the 
   Reverend Mother's &quot;seed pool&quot;), but when Phoenix is 
   captured by Cobalt and imprisoned (in a pen an armless person could

   her. They save Phoenix from an arena fight presided over by Cobalt 
   and head out into the Badlands, only to be captured by the Rezule, 
   who turn Skylar and Guy over to the Reverend Mother. Can Phoenix and

    Winters and Producer Peter Yuval's Action International Pictures 
   looks so impoverished, I doubt it could fill the shrunken belly of a 
   starving Somalian child. Everything about this film is so cheap, from 
   the stripper outfits the female extras wear; sets that look like they 
   were constructed out of rotting lumber, tin roofing, sticks and 
   backdrops made out of plastic drop cloths; fight scenes that look 
   like they were choreographed by Stevie Wonder; women who have no idea 
   how to hold a gun (some of the extras look utterly scared shitless 
   when they fire their weapons); to the horrific acting of everyone 
   involved (even old pros, like the late Khambatta and the beautiful 
   Kinmont, don't even try here). Director/co-scripter Robert Hayes (<B><A HREF="spy_high_2001.htm">SPY
    HIGH</A></B> - 2001) must have skipped the Continuity 101 class in 
   film school because the movie is a disjointed mess. Scenes begin and 
   end for no discernable reason at all and some scenes, like the birth 
   of Skylar, come out of nowhere, as the last time we saw Keela before 
   the birth, she didn't even have a baby bump! Believe it or not, Hayes 
   is now a well-respected cinematographer of low-budget genre films, 
   including the god-awful <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Werewolf">WEREWOLF</A></B> 
   (1995) and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Satanic2005">SATANIC</A></B> 
   (2005). For a film about a world populated by busty, skimpily dressed 
   females, there is precious little nudity, just a few topless shots 
   here and there (but none by Kinmont, damn it!) to hold your interest. 
   The screenplay, by Hayes and Dan Rotblatt, is generic post-nuke stuff 
   (Cirio H. Santiago's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Sisterhood1987">THE
    SISTERHOOD</A></B> [1987] covered the same territory much better), 
   but I have to admit that when the tribe of mutant Rezule starts 
   chanting the names of old TV shows during a sacrificial ritual 
   (&quot;Leave It To Beaver! Trapper John M.D.! Little House On The 
   Prairie!&quot;), it did bring a smile to my face. I can hardly

    SNAKE QUEEN</A><A NAME="SnakeQueen"></A> (1982) -</B> Those crazy 
   Indonesians are at it again. A beautiful queen wishes to have a baby 
   because she is lonely, so she pleads to the gods for guidance. Rather 
   than sending her a good looking man to produce a baby the old 
   fashioned way, the gods tell her to create a storm in the South Sea, 
   raise a dragon's egg from the bottom of the ocean and place the egg 
   in the Cave of Secrets. The egg will then hatch into a beautiful 
   Snake Queen (Imagine if all babies were made that way!), which the 
   gods tell the lonely queen to name Queen Para. Well, the lonely queen 
   does as she's instructed, but when the egg hatches in the Cave of 
   Secrets (I was laughing so hard, I nearly coughed-up a kidney!), a 
   fully grown woman (Suzzanna; <B><A HREF="#QueenOfBlackMagic">QUEEN OF

   control snakes (among other powers). Queen Para begins ruling over

   plan, where he asks local boy Andika (Barry Prima; <B><A HREF="#Warrior1981">THE

   offering Andika's life to the Snake Queen once the marriage ceremony

    Johan (George Rudy) is looking for the Snake Queen to offer his 
   undying devotion in exchange for riches. An old hag named Miss Eno 
   gives him directions to the Cave of Secrets, where he finds a group 
   of seductive handmaidens (one who sucks her thumb like she is giving 
   it head!). The young lasses jump into a pond and Queen Para rises 
   from the water. She makes Johan eat a plate of human baby body parts 
   to prove his devotion (he does grudgingly) and then tells him to go 
   home to his wife (!) and prepare a secret chamber in his house, where 
   she will arrive the following Wednesday for a night of sex. When 
   Wednesday arrives, Johan discovers that his young daughter is dead 
   (those body parts her ate may have been his daughter's!) and the 
   Snake Queen arrives at the secret chamber (in her flying horse-drawn 
   chariot!) to fuck Johan's brains out. When Johan's wife interrupts 
   their lovemaking, Queen Para turns into a snake and kills them both. 
   When the village turns out for Johan's burial, his body suddenly 
   becomes too big to fit in his grave (!), which is the catalyst in a 
   series of events that involves the greedy Kokoro, his new wife Dewi 
   (also portrayed by Suzzanna), daughter Sasti and groom-to-be Andika. 
   Things get out of hand when Andika falls madly in love with Dewi, 
   which throws a monkey wrench in Kokoro's deal with the Snake Queen. 
   It turns out that Dewi is actually the Snake Queen in disguise (not a 
   very good one if you ask me) and she also finds herself falling in 
   love with Andika, but the gods will not let her spend her life with a 
   mere mortal. Needless to say, Kokoro tries to back-end his deal with 
   the Snake Queen and enlists hag Miss Eno to do battle with her. It 
   doesn't end well for Eno or Kokoro, as they both end up falling off 
   cliffs to their deaths, only in entirely different ways. Don't worry 
   though, folks, because the Snake Queen will return in future 
   installments.&nbsp; In case you didn't get the hint, this is the

   some unexplained ritual; a scene where a man with a burning head 
   splits his body in half at the waist (the bottom half runs around the 
   top half for a few moments!), which results in the flaming head to 
   become detached and roll on the ground; a strange vision of Hell, 
   where Sasti sees her dead mother walk across a burning bridge made up 
   of human bodies; a <B><A HREF="wizard_of_oz.htm">WIZARD OF OZ</A></B>

   good guy role) is opposed by the cardinal of the castle (Fernando 
   Rey), who sees everything that Kinski does as the Devil's work. He 
   destroys Kinski's lab (including the ball) just after Kinski saves a 
   small amount of the potion. IX is opposed by a fumbling would-be 
   knight (Harvey Keitel, whose presence seems out of place spouting 
   ancient dialogue with his Brooklyn accent) who wants IX's spacesuit 
   (he sees it as the ultimate armour) and seeks the princess' hand in 
   marriage (as well as half of the land she owns). It all leads to a 
   final confrontation (a jousting match) where almost everyone lives 
   happily ever after. There is much to dislike here (Kinski's dubbing, 
   Keitel's performance, the stilted dialogue) but the overall good 
   humored way the story is told finally won me over. Rey does a good 
   comic turn with his role, blaming all the ills of the world on the 
   Devil. Kinski turns in a rare restrained performance as the alchemist 
   with a heart of gold. The cinematography is lush and the music score 
   is above par. </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="star_knight_1986b.htm">STAR

   Here's an early fantasy/adventure film from gaillo and horror film

   the jungle/cannibal genre. When gambler and adventurer Alan Foster <A HREF="temple_of_the_thousand_lights_1965.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/temple of a thousand lights lobbycard small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="140" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(Richard
    Harrison) loses $250,000 to Rajah Sindar (Daniele Vargas) in a poker 
   game, he flees the palace and roams India (actually filmed in 
   Malaysia) looking for a way to repay the debt (or skip out on paying 
   it). In his travels, he befriends a fakir named Sitama (Wilbert 
   Bradley), who can make a rope travel up to the sky and perform other 
   magic tricks. After Sitama darkens-up Alan's skin (to make him blend 
   in), they devise a plan to steal the &quot;Mountain Of Light&quot;, a 
   200 carat diamond embedded in the head of a giant statue in the 
   heavily guarded Temple Of The Thousand Lights. Together, with Alan's 
   ingenuity and Sitama's magical powers, they proceed to steal the 
   diamond. Along the way, they have to deal with a pack of hungry rats, 
   a pool of ravenous alligators and a couple of other close calls. Once 
   they get their hands on the diamond, Alan and Sitama must avoid the 
   deadly grip of the devious Rajah Sindar and his palace guards. They 
   must contend with deadly tigers, jungle booby traps, poisonous snakes 
   and a double-cross before the film ends. In the finale, Alan 
   discovers he was set-up from the beginning and must face one more 
   death-defying trap before he can put everything right (he breaks the 
   fourth wall and talks directly to the audience in the humorous 
   finale).&nbsp; This is a fairly innocent mid-60's Italian fantasy 
   adventure in the vein of <B><A HREF="king_solomons_mines_1950.htm">KING
    SOLOMON'S MINES</A></B> (1950). While very low on blood and gore, 
   there are plenty of fist fights, gun battles and funny dialogue 
   (&quot;Your stench keeps me from concentrating&quot;; &quot;By Sheba, 
   he's escaped us!&quot;; &quot;Do you want to denounce me? I won't 
   hold it against you.&quot;) to keep you fairly entertained. Most of 
   the &quot;Indians&quot; are portrayed by Italian actors with dark 
   makeup on their faces (but not on the rest of their body!) and the 
   Malaysian locales are very colorful.&nbsp; <A HREF="richard_harrison_films.htm">Richard

   brush, grabs a tree branch with both hands and pushes, dropping a 
   baby. That baby is Thor and the barbarian is his father, who has the 
   unfortunate name of Kunt (Angelo Ragusa; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Hitch-Hike1978">HITCH-HIKE</A></B> 
   - 1978). He holds the baby Thor up in the air and praises the gods,

   Gnut's tribesmen and the evil Gnut dispatches Kunt with an arrow 
   through his neck (it seems to be his favorite way of killing), 
   finishing off the slaughter by killing Thor's mother (offscreen). 
   Gnut is surprised to see Kunt's sword turn into a snake (he wanted

   disappearing. &quot;<B>Many moons times ten have passed. The Earth

   eaten and, sure enough, they cut off the arm of a male slave and eat 
   it! Thor defeats the cannibal tribe with his trusty club, as Etna 
   perches above to watch the action. One cannibal rakes Thor's eyes, so 
   he grabs the cannibal's sword and kills him (This is the first time 
   he has used a sword and he likes it). Rather than freeing Sheeba, 
   Thor brings her back to his cave, where Etna tells him, &quot;<B>No, 
   Thor, she's not something to eat! Make her lie down and play with 
   her! What else is she good for? The female is stupid! Have your way

    Thor and Etna then roam the land, looking for the sword (and more 
   women, I'll bet). They come upon a destroyed village where Thor is 
   attacked by the Cannibal Chief (Giovanni Cianfriglia), who can appear 
   and disappear in a flash of light (Etna is not the only one with that 
   power). He runs the Chief through with his new sword and picks up the 
   Chief's axe (This film's &quot;hook&quot; is that every battle Thor 
   wins, he gets a more advanced weapon). Thor, who is now in Virgin 
   Territory (or so Etna says), looks for more women to screw and is 
   attacked by three virgin warriors. Being a man, Thor hides and 
   attacks the women when they least expect it, killing two of the 
   virgins. The third virgin, Ino (Malisa Longo; <B><A HREF="super_stooges_vs_the_wonder_women_1975.htm">SUPER
    STOOGES VS. THE WONDER WOMEN</A></B> - 1974), Thor rapes and then

    Thor is captured by another barbarian tribe, where a beer-bellied 
   barbarian (!) cuts his throat and drinks his blood. Ino saves Thor 
   (Why???), frees him from his shackles and Thor steals some of the 
   tribe's seeds (WTF?!?) before they escape. Thor and Ino become lovers 
   and screw away in their new cave, while Etna (who is 
   watching...again) pronounces them man and wife. The hungry newlyweds 
   come in contact with another tribe, where the Barbarian Chief 
   (Artemio Antonini) reneges on a trade for food (Thor gives him Ino's 
   necklace and the Chief gives them a basket of animal bones). Thor 
   kills the Chief by bashing his head in with a rock and then eats all 
   the tribe's food, not sharing it with Ino (He is truly a barbarian!). 
   Thor and Ino then enter the &quot;Land Of The Unknown&quot;, where 
   his father's sword is said to be. Thor sees the ocean for the <A HREF="thor_the_conqueror_1983_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/thor the conqueror spain poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>first

   home on the beach and Etna tells us Ino is pregnant. They don't

   own. The couple become buddies with a friendly tribe, who offer to 
   help Thor find the sword. Will he find it? Will Gnut steal the sword 
   and kill Thor? Will their baby be shot in the neck with an arrow? How 
   will Thor see his baby when Gnut burns his eyes out with a flaming

    This ridiculous piece of peplum fantasy is entertaining in a 
   mind-numbing sort of way. The Italians, who invented the peplum genre 
   back in the late-1950s with the Steve Reeves-starrer <B><A HREF="hercules_1958.htm">HERCULES</A></B> 
   (1958), churned-out hundreds of these films until the mid-'60s, when

   nudity and graphic violence than their original counterparts, 
   something audiences demanded during the '80s, but we also grew tired 
   of them. Director &quot;Anthony Richmond&quot;, better known as

   to offer us are badly-staged (but bloody) fights and some extreme 
   scenes of misogyny. Ricci used Conrad Nichols (real name: Bruno

   gods when things don't go his way. Thor has so many &quot;firsts&quot;
    in this film (women, weapons, oceans, riding a horse, etc) that 
   you'll be wondering if Etna raised him in a vacuum. I was never a fan 
   of this genre, but this film is good for a few unintentional laughs,

   pseudonym &quot;Antonin Gasner&quot;). If you've seen any of Ho's 
   pastiche films, you know what to expect: About ten minutes of 
   newly-shot footage of Caucasian actors<A HREF="vampire_raiders_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/vampire raiders ninja queen dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   duking it out amongst themselves, intercut sporadically (about every 
   twenty minutes or so) with some unreleased Hong Kong, Thai or 
   Filipino genre film. The old footage here is some unknown Hong Kong 
   horror comedy about hopping vampires that is intercut with new scenes 
   of a female undercover agent posing as a model who transforms into a 
   red-clad ninja that fights the dreaded Vampire Ninja Clan (I know, I 
   know). The film proper is about a young female telephone operator 
   named Elsie who overhears a phone conversation she shouldn't have and 
   pretty soon she begins seeing vampires at the most inopportune times. 
   She takes to reading the Bible for protection (She reads a passage 
   out that goes, &quot;And God says unto Moses, 'I've got some 
   commandments for you. Go get a pen and write them down.'&quot; What? 
   A pen?), but it doesn't seem to do much good because her vampire 
   visions come more frequently (I would have went directly for the 
   crucifix and skipped the Bible completely, but that's just me). 
   Meanwhile, our female ninja has various attempts made on her life, 
   such as when someone tries to kill her by tossing a live pig (one of 
   those big honking ones!) off a roof and onto her head (it ends up 
   crushing an innocent bystander instead) or when she is sunbathing on 
   a beach in her skimpy bikini (gratuitous crotch shots!) and a vampire 
   pops out from under the sand and grabs her breasts (it turns into one 
   of the silliest martial arts fights in Ho's canon). Elsie and her two 
   female operator co-workers try to figure out how to stop the vampire 
   menace, so they listen-in to telephone calls made by Mr. Ho, who 
   Elsie believes controls the vampires, and with the help of their 
   dimwitted male friend Fattie, try to save the life of Mr. Wong, who 
   Elsie believes is next on Mr. Ho's hit list. They warn Mr. Wong, but 
   he doesn't take them seriously and brushes them off by saying, 
   &quot;Cut it! Piss on it! Shit on it!&quot; (Yeah, he's a class act). 
   When Elsie and her friends actually end up saving Mr. Wong's ass 
   anyway, he rewards them by sending them on a weeklong vacation on his 
   yacht and, wouldn't you know it, they find themselves trapped in the 
   middle of the ocean on a yacht overrun with zombies. Will the urine 
   from a virgin save their lives (Where do they come up with this <A HREF="vampire_raiders_1988b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/vampire raiders ninja queen german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>stuff?)
    or will they all die in a watery grave? And what about our red 
   female ninja? Will she defeat the Vampire Ninja Clan? Do I really 
   need to tell you?&nbsp; Say what you want about Godfrey Ho. His films 
   lack cohesion and contain some hilariously bad English dubbing (I 
   sometimes think the Australian dubbing crew purposely inserts the bad 
   dialogue in there, especially the Moses and the pen line, just to see 
   if anyone on the production end is paying attention. Apparently, 
   they're not.), but they are never boring. Watching his films are akin 
   to suffering from a fever dream, where nothing makes any sense at 
   all, but, damn, if you just go with it, you are guaranteed on having 
   a good time. <B>THE VAMPIRE RAIDERS</B> (VHS box title: <B><A HREF="vampire_raiders_1988b.htm">VAMPIRE
    RAIDERS NINJA QUEEN</A></B>) is no different, as it contains many 
   &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moments, including the pig-tossing, the 
   beach battle scene (Ho is content on having our female ninja parade 
   around in the skimpiest bikini imaginable, oblivious to the fact that 
   she has a huge ugly birthmark on the back of her upper left thigh. 
   She is a looker, though.), a pleasure boat being piloted by a crew of 
   zombies, and other insanity. Ho's rejiggering of the plot makes 
   absolutely no sense other than to justify his insertion of the 
   newly-shot footage (which is badly integrated into the older 
   footage), but that's one of the reasons why Ho's films play so well 
   if you're in the right frame of mind (If you're not, Ho's films can 
   seem mighty insufferable). The final battle between the female red 
   ninja and the Vampire Ninja Clan (which includes two comical hopping 
   vampires) is one of Ho's more accomplished insert footage sequences. 
   It has actual martial arts choreography, wire work, a flying 
   dismembered head and other weirdness. It looks as if Ho put some 
   thought and time into filming it and was not his usual rush job. As 
   usual, the music soundtrack is full of lifted (and illegally 
   obtained) music cues from other sources, including TV's <B><A HREF="addams_family_tv_series.htm">THE

   the tyrannical Dutch rulers capture Indonesian rebel (and hero) Jaka 
   Sembung (Barry Prima) and put him in a labor camp. He escapes after a 
   revolt (where the prison guards slaughter half of the inmates) and 
   the Dutch government puts a bounty on his head. The first bounty

   impervious to bullets and knives (he can also breathe fire!). After 
   proving his worth to Dutch officer Mr. Van Shram (by twisting the 
   neck of an ox, killing it!), Kobar tracks down Jaka and they fight. 
   Jaka quickly kills Kobar by shoving a bamboo pole through his mouth 
   until it protrudes out the back of his head (fire shoots out of the 
   pole!). Mr. Van Shram is pissed and the next person to offer to kill

   so big, he can't close his mouth), who levitates a soldier to prove 
   his power. He resurrects Ki Item (W.D. Mochtar) from the dead after 
   rejoining Ki Item's body with his missing head (a sequence not to be

   their search for Jaka (including putting a gun to a little boy's 
   head), Jaka comes to their rescue and battles powerful sorcerer Ki

   parade his bloody, beaten body through the town. Jaka is crucified in 
   a dungeon (spikes are driven through his hands) in front of the other 
   prisoners. Jaka's girlfriend, Serti (Eva Arnaz), leads a revolt as 
   Van Shram's daughter Maria (Dana Christina) tries to free Jaka in the 
   dungeon, but her father catches her. He slaps her around and pokes 
   out both of Jaka's eyes with a spike (quite graphically). Serti is 
   also captured and put in the dungeon, where the eyeless Jaka prays to 
   Allah and then pulls the spikes out of his hands with his teeth. The 
   now-seemingly superhuman Jaka knocks down the dungeon walls and bars 
   with his bare hands (Ah, the power of prayer!), but Ki Item turns him 
   into a pig (!) and Serti is shot in the back. To give away any more 
   would be depriving you of a truly twisted tale of faith and devotion. 
   Let's just say it involves eye transplants, flying heads and a fierce 
   battle between two sorcerers. &quot;Don't let him touch the 
   ground!&quot;&nbsp; This film, directed by Indonesian stalwart 
   Sisworo Gautama Putra (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Primitives">PRIMITIVES</A></B> 
   - 1978), is non-stop madness from beginning to end and was so popular 
   in it's native country, it spawned several sequels, all starring 
   Barry Prima as Jaka Sembung. Highly critical of the Dutch government 
   (which is funny, because I watched this on a dub taken from a 
   Dutch-subtitled VHS tape) and gory as hell, <B>THE WARRIOR</B> is 
   must-viewing for all weird film lovers. Mixing true-life historical 
   events with way-out fantasy elements, this film never slows down and 
   is never boring, even if it does hit you over the head repeatedly 
   with the &quot;Allah is great!&quot; religious message. While the 
   Dutch and Dutch sympathizers are portrayed as evil incarnate (One 
   Dutch sympathizer describes Jaka by saying, &quot;He's lower than 
   scum!&quot;) and the villagers as the poor, downtrodden victims, 
   there's enough crazy dialogue (&quot;What's it like being pig for a 
   day?&quot;) and bloody carnage (eye gougings, impalements, floating 
   heads, bloody stumps, leaves used as weapons and Jaka's unbelievable 
   final battle with Ki Item) to get your mind off the ridiculousness of 
   it all. There's really no martial arts involved until the finale, 
   where the villagers take matters into their own hands and attack the 
   Dutch stronghold (lots of stabbings and spurting blood) and Jaka goes 
   one-on-one with Van Shram. As with most Indonesian flicks, there's 
   also out-of-place comedy relief (Here, it's a retarded villager who, 
   at one point says, &quot;Hey, look at me! I'm a monkey!&quot;, but 
   even he dies in the finale). Put this on your must-own list. American 
   history was never this entertaining. Gope T. Samtani, who directed 
   the war action film <B><A HREF="hell_raiders_1985.htm">HELL RAIDERS</A></B> 
   (1985, starring many of the same actors as here), produced this. Also

    move in to slaughter the villagers, hometown rebel (and hero) Jaka 
   Sembung (Barry Prima) and his men show up and kill all the soldiers 
   except for one, who they riddle with arrows and send back to Dutch 
   headquarters as a warning. Listening to all this on a hilltop ia 
   blind swordsman Si Buta (Advent Bangun), who comments (in voiceover) 
   that death is a sound he's heard often. When the seriously-injured 
   soldier makes his way to headquarters, it pisses-off his Dutch 
   superiors, who hold a grand tournament to find the best fighter to 
   defeat Jaka. At the tournament, where a series of strongmen fight 
   each other (one has a tree stump broken over his head; another bites 
   the ear off his opponent), Si Buta shows up and defeats the winner to 
   become Jaka's hunter. Si Buta agrees to lead a group of Dutch 
   soldiers in their quest to kill Jaka in return for a chest of gold. 
   Si Buta is helped by witch Maki (who likes to hang out in trees), who 
   tells him every so often that &quot;Jaka is near&quot;. When Si Buta 
   and Jaka meet a short time later, they get into a fight and Si Buta 
   cut's off Jaka's head and takes it as proof of his death. Si Buta 
   brings Jaka's head back to Dutch headquarters, where evil Captain 
   Rakoni orders the head to be displayed on a pole in the town square. 
   The Captain also orders his men to follow and kill Si Buta and bring 
   back the gold. Si Buta manages to kill all the soldiers following 
   him, but is mortally wounded by a gunshot (he removes the bullet with 
   his combination cane/sword). Maki heals him, but when she makes love 
   to him and offers to have his baby (as well as immortality), he 
   rebuffs her, which really pisses her off. Maki begins shooting 
   fireballs out of her palms and jumps up and down on Si Buta's chest, 
   but he is saved by Jaka. It turns out that Si Buta never killed Jaka 
   at all, as he was only fighting an &quot;illusion&quot; and the head 
   hanging in the town square turns out to be that of a jackass! To show 
   his appreciation to Jaka for saving his life, Si Buka gives all his 
   gold to the village people. All is not well, though, as Maki has now 
   aligned herself with the Dutch. She offers to help Captain Rakoni 
   kill Jaka and Si Buta using her powers of sorcery (including 
   invisibility) in exchange for the safety of her village of all-female 
   warriors. When Maki kidnaps a child with magical p<A HREF="warrior_against_the_blind_swordsman_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/warrior against the blind swordsman vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>owers
    from Jaka's village, Jaka and Si Buta join forces to save the child. 
   Just when everything seems hunky-dory, the damn Dutch show up with 
   their cannons again. Oh boy!&nbsp; While basically nothing more than 
   a remake of <B>THE WARRIOR</B> (with more fantasy elements and a lot 
   less religious subtext than the original), <B>THE WARRIOR 2</B>, also 
   known as <B><A HREF="warrior_against_the_blind_swordsman_1983.htm">THE
    WARRIOR AGAINST THE BLIND SWORDSMAN</A></B>, contains a lot of gory 
   scenes (heads flying through the air, too many impalements to count 
   and many other bloody moments) and even some sex and nudity this time 
   around. As with most Indonesian films, the Dutch are portrayed as 
   back-stabbing evil bastards who can't be trusted to keep their word 
   (I never did trust the Dutch, with their vowel-heavy language and 
   words that contain way too many &quot;J&quot;'s and &quot;V&quot;'s!) 
   and the Indonesian people, no matter how evil they are, can find 
   redemption (as both Si Buta and Maki do here). There are many fantasy 
   scenes to be found here and the highlight is Maki's healing at the 
   hands of &quot;The Dark Master&quot; in his underground lair, who may 
   very well be the Devil himself (he has a long furry tail that he uses 
   to strangle people!). The film has precious little to do with the 
   title character (Barry Prima has very little screen time until the 
   finale) and more to do with Si Buta (who would soon get a film series 
   of his own) and Maki. The script (by Darto Joned, who also wrote the 
   script for the first film as well as dozens of others) seems to head 
   in a different direction every 30 minutes, The first part deals with 
   Si Buta's pursuit of Jaka, the middle about Maki's and Si Buta's 
   relationship and the final 30 minutes brings all three characters 
   together with the child kidnapping. Director Dasri Jacob (listed here 
   as &quot;Dasri Yacob&quot;) has directed many Indonesian films, but I 
   believe this is his only one that was dubbed into English. This film 
   is all nonsense, mind you, but it is entertaining nonsense. The next 
   film in the series was <B><A HREF="#WarriorAndNinja">THE WARRIOR AND NINJA</A></B> 
   (1985). Also starring W.D. Mochtar, Rukman Herman, Sri Gudhy Sintara,

   erupting volcano rains down boulders and lava on Jaka's village,

   loyalist Ki Demang (El Manik; <B><A HREF="hell_raiders_1985.htm">HELL RAIDERS</A></B> 
   - 1985) and paraplegic sorcerer Maruta, who gives Roweta the 
   &quot;evil eye&quot;, almost killing her. Jaka carries her to a 
   witch's house located in a tree for a cure and wonders if he can ever 
   convince his people to rise against their oppressors. Jaka then 
   battles Balung and nearly loses his life, but he remembers his 
   Master's teachings and defeats Balung by dunking him in water (iron 
   and water don't mix very well) and delivering a few deadly blows that 
   makes Balung's body break into several bloody pieces (Jaka has 
   Balung's severed head delivered to Ki Demang with a note that reads: 
   &quot;He would have defeated me, but he was a little rusty!&quot;). 
   This, of course, infuriates Ki Demang to no end, so he begins killing 
   innocent villagers until Jaka turns himself in. Jaka relents and is 
   tortured with a swinging pendulum, but Rowena arrives in the nick of 
   time to save him from being separated at the waist. It all ends with 
   a martial arts extravaganza, as Jaka and Rowena battle the bad guys

   several lengthy martial arts fights (where slow-motion and reverse

    two documentary filmmakers (Dan Brinkle and Kyle Nudd) to help him 
   uncover the mystery and to help him avenge the death of his sister 
   and every person remotely connected to anyone who lived in Wicksboro. 
   Lloyd is convinced that aliens are populating the Earth and has 
   created a device that can detect aliens from humans. A green light 
   means the person is human. A red light means the person is an alien. 
   Lloyd brings the device out to the streets where we learn (in a 
   humorous fashion) that half of the people walking the streets are 
   alien. The filmmakers are somewhat dubious of Lloyd and his device 
   since they know that he is an alcoholic and prone to exaggeration. 
   They also cannot find Wicksboro on any map of Texas, so they must 
   trust Lloyd to help them find some evidence that Wicksboro actually 
   existed. This leads the trio on a road trip to Texas to find the 
   town. Everything looks hopeless as it seems Wicksboro has been wiped 
   off the face of the Earth. They are about to head back to Los Angeles 
   when Lloyd begs for one last chance to look for his underground bomb 
   shelter using a metal coat hanger as a divining rod! To everyone's 
   surprise, it works, as they find the bomb shelter and all the 
   evidence that proves Lloyd's entire story is true. Trouble begins 
   when they realize that they are being followed by a helicopter, an 
   unmarked car and some of the mysterious faceless Men In Black (who 
   are alien according to Lloyd's device). It's a race back to Los 
   Angeles to turn in the video evidence to the TV News before they are 
   killed by the mysterious invaders (whom we are never given a clear

   seeing. Sergio reads the ad (we don't see it) and drives to the 
   address in the ad; a giant castle-like structure (a 
   &quot;palazzo&quot;, or palace) in the middle of the city. He is 
   buzzed into the building by Consuelo Lorente (Sarah Ferrati), who 
   happens to be the old woman who was following him. Sergio&nbsp; 
   discovers that Consuelo knows nearly everything about him, yet they 
   have never met. The ad in the newspaper was written specifically for 
   him. She wants him to catalogue and transcribe private manuscripts in 
   her huge private library. Sergio is not too keen on the idea of 
   working in a dusty and dark library that is full of rats (Consuelo 
   says, &quot;I consider sunlight the worst enemy to old things.&quot;),
    that is, until she mentions a hefty salary and free room and board

   library, only he's lazy and acts like the master of the palazzo. 
   Consuelo hopes that Sergio's presence will make the man respect the 
   job, telling Sergio that if he doesn't, he can fire him. When

   angrily says, &quot;We have nothing in common! Nothing!&quot; Sergio 
   thinks the daughter does protest a little too much, as he changes the 
   subject, asking to see Aura's room. &quot;Perhaps later&quot;, says 
   Aura, asking Sergio why he thought her mother was hitting on him. 
   Sergio doesn't answer, other than to ask how she knew that. Aura&nbsp;
    then shows Sergio the palace's garden greenhouse, where her mother 
   grows a special plant from seeds she purchased in Mexico, which she 
   uses in the tea she drinks. Sergio grabs Aura and kisses her, asking 
   her, &quot;Do you mind?&quot; after doing so (!), but Aura is 
   perturbed by cats in the greenhouse, telling Sergio to get rid of 
   them (Whenever cats are around Aura, they meow loudly and hiss. There 
   must be a reason why, right?). Sergio throws rocks at the cats (You 
   know what they say about people living in glass houses; that they 
   shouldn't throw stones?), chasing them out of the greenhouse. Sergio 
   asks Aura why she hates cats and she tells him her mother likes the 
   filthy beasts. When Aura leaves the greenhouse, Sergio finds a dead 
   cat on the floor, a noose around its neck (Aura must really hate 
   cats!). Sergio loses sight of Aura and when he goes looking for her, 
   he discovers Consuelo in one of the hallways, leaning against the 
   wall. Sergio tells her he found a dead cat in the greenhouse and it 
   looks like someone tortured it before killing it. Consuelo blames 
   &quot;hooligans&quot; for killing the cat, saying they invade the 
   property on a regular basis, leaving death and destruction in their 
   wake. Consuelo tells Sergio that she is looking for the right man for 
   Aura and that she's waiting for him in the library, but when he goes 
   to the library, she's not there (He phones Lorna, telling her to keep 
   everything warm for him, including herself [!], as he will be coming 
   there shortly. Wanna bet?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Sergio notices a dead man encased in a glass coffin in the library, 
   Aura suddenly appearing and telling him it is her father, Consuelo's 
   husband. Aura also tells Sergio that her mother comes here often and 
   stares at her husband for hours, never saying a word. Aura says most 
   wives would do the same thing if they could afford it, saying to 
   Sergio it is not as strange as he thinks. She would, too, if she had 
   a man she loved as much as her mother. Aura asks Sergio if he's 
   staying for lunch, if he does, she'll prepare something 
   &quot;erotic&quot;, something from an old recipe. Sergio starts 
   fondling Aura erotically, Aura putting on some music and saying she 
   will make love to him, but no touching (!) and he has to listen to 
   her every word. Not using his hands, but rather his teeth (!), Sergio 
   unbuttons her blouse and unzips her dress from the back until she is 
   completely naked (Since this is a mid-'60s production, we only see 
   her naked back, but it is still quite sexy and erotic). They then 
   begin to make love, Aura saying, &quot;I've been waiting so 
   long!&quot;, when they are interrupted by Fabrizio (Gian Maria 
   Volont&egrave;; <B><A HREF="face_to_face_1967.htm">FACE TO FACE</A></B> 
   - 1967), the librarian Consuelo hired before finding Sergio. Fabrizio 
   looks at Aura and says, &quot;Aura, you're back again! I'm so 
   happy!&quot;, and hugs her naked body, which is now covered in a 
   sheet. He asks Sergio what day it is and when he says it is Monday, 
   Fabrizio says to Aura, &quot;All this time I haven't seen you; I've 
   been here with your mother. Happy to see me?&quot; Aura nervously 
   says, &quot;Yes, of course&quot; and when Fabrizio asks her what's 
   the story between her and Sergio, she says, &quot;That man attacked 
   me! That's the story!&quot;. Fabrizio doesn't believe her, checking 
   her and Sergio's bodies for nail scratches and bite marks, but 
   finding neither. Sergio tells Fabrizio he's the head librarian now 
   and tries to fire him, but he refuses to believe he is being 
   replaced. It's obvious that Fabrizio is madly in love with Aura and 
   she does this to every man who comes to the library, but why? You may 
   think you know the answer, but let me give you a few more important 
   plot points before you reach any concrete conclusions.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Sergio has had enough and goes to leave the palace, only to find 
   Consuelo performing a strange ritual with a metal crucifix. She tells 
   Sergio that his doctor friend jus left, so Sergio meets Marco 
   (Vittorio Venturoli) outside the palace. Marco tells Sergio that 
   Consuelo refused to be examined, but she gave him an envelope 
   containing fifty thousand lire and sent him on his way, telling 
   Sergio that she looked fine. Marco's opinion is that she's on drugs 
   and Sergio tells him her daughter thinks the same thing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sergio talks to an old woman (Ester Carloni; <B><A HREF="knock_out_cop_1973.htm">THE
    KNOCK OUT COP</A></B> - 1973) who owns an antique store adjoining 
   the palace and discovers that Consuelo sold off most of the palace's 
   belongings to the old woman for millions of lire over the years. 
   Sergio finds that herd to believe, saying Consuelo has very little 
   money, but the old woman says that's because Consuelo blew all her 
   money trying to stay young, telling Sergio that Consuelo is at least 
   twenty years older than she is. Sergio also finds that hard to 
   believe, telling the old woman she can't be that old, because she has 
   a fairly young daughter. The old woman says that is impossible, 
   Consuelo never had any children.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Sergio returns to the palace, Fabrizio begs him to absolve him 
   of all his sins, saying he knows who Sergio really is. Fabrizio tells 
   Sergio that if he doesn't want to be involved in a serious crime 
   (i.e. murder), he better leave the palace as soon as possible, as the 
   &quot;old lady&quot; and Aura like to play men off of each other; 
   he's tired of it and is about to do something drastic. Fabrizio is 
   quite mad and when Sergio tells Consuelo he wants the job, she 
   accepts, but only if he throws Fabrizio out of the palace. Fabrizio 
   goes bonkers, breaking the glass coffing and stabbing Consuelo's dead 
   husband in the heart with a sword (Fabrizio is an expert swordsman). 
   Sergio and Fabrizio get into a fight and Fabrizio dies suddenly and 
   mysteriously. Consuelo wants to get rid of Fabrizio's body, but 
   Sergio wants to report it to the police. Both Consuelo and Aura say 
   if he does, they will say that he murdered Fabrizio.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Is Sergio about to become the new Fabrizio? Do these two women share 
   the same man until they grow tired of him and find a new one? You 
   know, the same thing Sergio does with women when they get too serious 
   with him? And who is Aura? If she's not Consuelo's daughter, then who 
   is she? If you want these answers, as well as discovering how Sergio 
   gets rid of Fabrizio's body (a train is involved), I suggest you 
   watch the film. Needless to say, it's all a vicious circle, full of 
   death, sex and a twisted take on love, a love that Sergio is unable 
   to handle. Months pass and Sergio discovers Aura's real identity when 
   it is too late for him to leave. Then, a new librarian enters the 
   palace, holding a want ad from the newspaper written expressly for 
   him...How did they kill witches back in the old days?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   films, yet this is only the second one I am reviewing (along with <B><A HREF="case_is_closed_forget_it_1971.htm">CASE</A></B>).
    I really don't know why. It could be because I'm afraid my words 
   won't do the films the justice they deserve, but I promise you this: 
   All the films mentioned above will be reviewed by me in the near 
   future, only because they need to be seen by all serious lovers of 
   cinema. The screenplay to this film, co-written by Damiani and Ugo 
   Liberatore, the director/writer of <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED
    IN VENICE</A></B> (1978), as well as co-writing such genre films as <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#MillStoneWomen1960">MILL
    OF THE STONE WOMEN</A></B> (1960), <B><A HREF="trojan_horse_1961.htm">THE
    TROJAN HORSE</A></B> (1961) and <B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">NO 
   WAY OUT</A></B> (1973), and based on the novel &quot;Aura&quot; by 
   author Carlos Fuentes (which was considered &quot;unfilmable&quot; 
   until Damiani took a stab at it), is very adult in its approach to 
   love and sex, one having no relationship to the other, as Sergio is 
   incapable of showing real love to any female until he meets Aura. As 
   soon as his relationship with any mortal female gets serious, he's 
   gone and looking for another conquest to shack-up with., not even 
   bothering to leave a note explaining why. Sergio is a cad of the 
   first degree, but this was not unusual in films made during the 
   latter half of the &quot;Swinging '60s&quot;, where &quot;free 
   love&quot; ran rampant and not a single thought was paid to the 
   fairer sex (and vive versa). This film will have you wondering if 
   Aura is actually a ghost (she never touches her mother, which is a 
   major clue) or if she is a reincarnation of Consuelo's younger self. 
   This film is slow moving, but never boring, thanks to Damiani's fluid 
   direction, Richard Johnson's believable acting and the haunting music 
   score by Luis E. Bacalov (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DesignatedVictim71">THE
    DESIGNATED VICTIM</A></B> - 1971), which puts the viewer in the 
   middle of the haunting goings-on. Richard Johnson was no stranger to 
   the supernatural, earlier starring in the classic <B><A HREF="haunting_1963.htm">THE
    HAUNTING</A></B> (1963), as well as later appearing in the 
   exploitation classic <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondTheDoor1974">BEYOND
    THE DOOR</A></B> (1974). All in all, this is a nice little film, a

    DEVIL WOMAN</A><A NAME="WolfDevilWoman1982"></A> (1982) -</B> 
   Another crazy Hong Kong martial arts fantasy. A mother, father and 
   their young baby girl witness a sorcerer called &quot;Devil&quot; 
   (who wears a silver-sequins KKK-like hood with a red Skull &amp; 
   Crossbones emblazoned on the front) <A HREF="wolf_devil_woman_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wolf devil woman poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>kill
    a man, who is crucified on a huge wooden cross, by using witchcraft 
   on a wax effigy of the man. Devil sticks a needle in the wax doll's 
   chest and the man starts bleeding profusely from a wound that 
   suddenly appears on his chest. When the wax doll is dipped into a 
   boiling substance head-first, the man starts spitting-out chunks of 
   flesh and dies. The mother and father take their baby girl and flee 
   from Devil and his vampire followers, ending up in the snowy 
   mountains with the bad guys not far behind. When Devil and his 
   minions have them cornered, the mother and father cut their arteries 
   with swords, bathing their baby girl in their blood (to keep her 
   warm) and then bang their heads repeatedly against the side of the 
   mountain, causing an avalanche and burying the baby alive (I told you 
   this was crazy!). Devil and his minions are able to dig-up the mother 
   and father's dead bodies, but when they try to find the baby girl, a 
   pack of wolves appear and chase them away. The wolves chow down on 
   Mom &amp; Dad's corpses (in graphic detail), but when they locate and 
   dig-up the baby girl, the leader of the pack, a white female wolf, 
   takes her back to their ice cave (a beautiful example of set 
   direction) and raises the baby as her own. Over the years we watch 
   the girl grow up (She seems to be wearing the skins of wolves. 
   Wouldn't that be considered the same as a human wearing the skin of 
   another human? Just asking.) and learning the way of the wolf (Once, 
   when she was a little girl, she almost died, but the alpha female 
   while wolf feeds her the magical &quot;thousand year ginseng&quot; 
   and she miraculously recovers). Now that she is a fully grown woman, 
   the Wolf Devil Woman (director/screenwriter Chang Ling, also known as 
   &quot;Pearl Cheung&quot;) is a master hunter, capable of jumping long 
   distances or digging holes quickly under the snow to catch rabbits, 
   which she rips apart with her bare hands (in graphic detail). 
   Meanwhile, Devil is cutting a swath of death and destruction 
   throughout the land, killing those who refuse to join his cult. An 
   expert martial artist and bowman, called &quot;Young Master&quot;, 
   and his always complaining sidekick Rudy are walking through the 
   mountains (looking for that elusive thousand year ginseng) when they 
   are attacked by Wolf Devil Woman and the alpha female wolf. Rudy puts 
   an arrow into the Wolf Devil Woman and Young Master kills the alpha 
   female wolf, but when the wolf dies, Young Master passes out and 
   becomes possessed by the wolf's spirit. He and Rudy nurse the Wolf 
   Devil Woman back to health and it is obvious that she (who only 
   speaks in grunts and growls) and Young Master will be lovers, 
   especially when he cures her of her curved spine (Did I fail to 
   mention that before?) and she is able to walk on two legs rather than 
   on all fours. Young Master teaches her how to speak and soon he, Rudy 
   and Wolf Devil Woman are talking about the thousand year ginseng and 
   how it's the only thing that can defeat Devil. When Young Master 
   (whose name is actually Rudolph! What are the odds of having two guys 
   named Rudolph and Rudy hanging out together? It's astronomical!) 
   learns that Wolf Devil Woman ate the only piece of ginseng for the 
   next thousand years, he wants her to come to his village, but when 
   she learns the truth of how her white wolf mother died and Young 
   Master shows her the<A HREF="wolfen_ninja_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wolfen ninja vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   body, her hair turns pure white (just like her wolf mother) and she 
   refuses to go with him. Young Master and Rudy return to their 
   village, where Young Master is captured by Devil and tortured on a 
   wooden crucifix until he agrees to join Devil's cult (Devil's main 
   trick is to quick-freeze his victim's blood). Wolf Devil Woman (whose 
   hair color has reverted back to normal) senses the danger Young 
   Master is in and sets out to rescue him, but Devil is expecting her 
   arrival. Will she be able to defeat Devil and rescue her new love 
   before he completely submits to the dark side?&nbsp; There's not that 
   many Hong Kong fantasy films directed by women in the 70's &amp; 80's 
   (I guess you could say the same thing about the United States, too), 
   which makes <B><A HREF="wolf_devil_woman_1982b.htm">WOLF DEVIL WOMAN</A></B> 
   such a treat for fans of Far East weirdness. Director/screenwriter 
   Chang Ling proves that she could get just as bloody and crazy as any 
   male director, such as when Wolf Devil Woman tears apart rabbits and 
   chickens with her bare hands (it all looked real to my eyes, which 
   made it all-the-more disturbing) or when she &quot;hulks out&quot; 
   every time she gets angry, her hair turning white and gaining 
   miraculous strength. The English dubbing (by obvious Australian voice 
   talent) is particularly hilarious, such as when a crowd chants 
   &quot;Kill the beast!&quot; like it is some sing-songy nursery rhyme 
   when they capture the Wolf Devil Woman or when Devil explains and shows-off
    his museum of oddities to Young Master (you have to hear him for 
   full comical effect). The martial arts sequences aren't particularly 
   inspired (there's a lot of slow-motion photography and wire work), 
   but there is enough weirdness and craziness on view for a dozen 
   fantasy films, including the amazingly gory fight on a sand dune 
   where Wolf Devil Woman decapitates, disembowels, rips-off a man's arm 
   and legs and uses her wolf-claw weapons to do bloody damage to an 
   army of Devil's followers. The finale, a frenetically edited sequence 
   of flying arrows, hopping vampires, zombie ninjas, spraying blood and 
   cheap optical effects, is a pure delight for the eyes and ears.

    VS. NINJA</A><A NAME="ZombieVsNinja"></A> (1988) -</B> Another 
   ridiculous cut-and-paste martial arts flick from 
   director/screenwriter Godfrey Ho (who uses the pseudonyms 
   &quot;Charles Lee&quot; and &quot;Benny Ho&quot; respectively here) 
   and producers Joseph Lai and Betty Chan for Lai's IFD Films And Arts 
   Ltd. production company. You know what to expect: About ten minutes 
   of newly-shot footage featuring Caucasian actors dressed in brightly 
   colored ninja outfits (with their fashionable headbands with the word 
   &quot;NINJA&quot; emblazoned on the front) beating the crap out of 
   each other, inserted intermittently into some unreleased Hong Kong 
   actioner, forming an incomprehensible mess of a hybrid film. The old 
   footage here is a period martial arts/fantasy about a young lad named 
   Ethan Chang searching for the killer of his father, who knew the 
   location to a fortune in gold. Ethan takes a job as an assistant to 
   an undertaker (an actor who sports a huge set of crooked buck teeth), 
   who is also a zombie master (the zombies are a lot like hopping 
   vampires, but without the fangs). Ethan travels the countryside with 
   a coffin strapped to <A HREF="zombie_vs_ninja_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/zombie vs ninja vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="321" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>his
    back (!), getting into a series of comical kung-fu fights where he 
   uses the coffin as part of his arsenal. In the newly-shot footage, 
   good ninja Duncan (Pierre Kirby; <B><A HREF="american_force_2_untouchable_glory_1988.htm">AMERICAN
    FORCE 2: THE UNTOUCHABLE GLORY</A></B> - 1988) battles evil ninja 
   Mason (Edowan Bersmea) and his never-ending supply of bad ninjas over 
   an old fighting style called the &quot;Dragon's Fire&quot;, which 
   will only get stronger once the missing gold is found (Don't strain 
   your brain trying to figure this out. Just go with it.). Meanwhile, 
   the the snaggly-toothed undertaker also turns out to be a kung-fu 
   Master, so in true 80's montage fashion, he slowly teaches Ethan the 
   finer points of the martial arts by first increasing Ethan's stamina 
   by making him walk around with a coffin filled with rocks strapped to 
   his back. Ethan doesn't take anything seriously, as he uses the 
   coffin as a sled to slide down a snow-filled mountain and then shaves 
   off his Master's beard and moustache while he sleeps! Eventually, 
   even with all his buffoonery, Ethan becomes an expert martial artist, 
   especially when his Master makes him fight one of his kung-fu zombies 
   to hone his skills. In the finale, Ethan must defeat a multitude of 
   bad guys before doing battle with Titus, the person responsible for 
   the death of his father. Duncan and Mason also face-off in a fight to 
   the death, using their swords, smoke grenades and the uncanny ability 
   to disappear and reappear at will until only one is left 
   standing.&nbsp; It's really hard to explain the allure of these Ho/Lai
    pastiche flicks, but they have an absurd charm to them that makes 
   for an entertaining night's viewing if you are in the right frame of 
   mind. My best explanation is either you &quot;get it&quot; or you 
   don't and, believe me, I totally understand if you don't get it. 
   While all these films follow the same exact formula, the enjoyment 
   level varies from film to film, depending on the craziness factor of 
   the newly shot scenes, the old footage used and the hilarious English 
   dubbing. Some of Ho's films work solely because of the old footage 
   and the bad dubbing (such as his <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#ThunderGiganticSerp">THUNDER
    OF GIGANTIC SERPENT</A></B> -1988; also starring Kirby and Bersmea), 
   some entertain solely on the new footage (such as <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#MajesticThunderbolt">MAJESTIC
    THUNDERBOLT</A></B> [1984] and <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#NinjaTerminator1986">NINJA

    THUNDERBOLT</A></B> - 1986). <B>ZOMBIE VS. NINJA</B> falls into the 
   first category, as the newly shot footage is basically unexceptional, 
   but the old footage and dubbing are priceless. The film proper is a 
   comical fantasy that contains a lot of martial arts and borrows 
   themes from <B><A HREF="fearless_vampire_killers_1967.htm">THE 
   FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS</A></B> (1967), including the coffin sled 
   ride. It also contains some weird dream sequences where Ethan has 
   non-comical nightmares of him killing his Master or finding him

    TROOPERS</A><A NAME="Zone Troopers"></A> (1985) -</B> Interesting 
   hybrid from executive producer Charles Band's Empire Pictures (which 
   would make <B><A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> the 
   same year) that mixes World War II action with sci-fi elements, with 
   enjoyable results. It's 1944 and a squad of American soldiers 
   stationed in the middle of nowhere in the Italian forest are ambushed 
   by a platoon of Nazis. After the fighting is through, all that 
   remains on the American side are Sgt. Stone (Tim Thomerson), Mittens 
   (Art La Fleur), PFC Joey Verona (Timothy Van Patten) and Charlie 
   Dolan (Biff Manard), a civilian newspaper reporter. As they are being 
   chased further behind enemy lines by the Krauts, it becomes obvious 
   that they are not alone in the woods. With their compass acting 
   screwy and unexpectedly being saved by a mysterious beam of light 
   that obliterates a tree that nearly falls on them, the Americans 
   discover a secret German SS camp in the middle of the forest. Just 
   what are the SS doing there? Apparently, the SS is there 
   investigating the crash of an alien spaceship. Sgt Stone and Joey 
   find the crashed<A HREF="zone_troopers_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/zone troopers vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   ship and go inside, while Mittens and Charlie are captured by the 
   Germans. While in the ship, Stone and Joey find the body of a dead 
   alien and escape from the ship just before the Germans surround it. 
   Stone and Joey destroy the ship (by throwing a grenade in it's 
   tailpipe!) and move on to save Mittens and Charlie, who are being 
   tortured by the Krauts. The SS have also captured the surviving alien 
   (makeup effects by John Carl Buechler), who eventually joins forces 
   with the Americans when Hitler arrives to view his new prize (Mittens 
   even gets a cheap shot in, giving Der Fuhrer a bloody nose!). The 
   four Americans steal the truck containing the caged alien (who saves 
   their hides by putting a force field around the truck) and the five 
   of them hide out in a mausoleum for the night where Joey (who's a big 
   sci-fi freak) and the alien bond (it likes to eat cigarettes!). The 
   alien gives Joey a device where whatever he thinks becomes real, so 
   he thinks of a beautiful woman. She materializes, but Mittens breaks 
   the device and she disappears. The next morning, a rescue ship 
   appears and whisks the alien (who we find out is female) away, but 
   not before Joey is killed by a German tank shell. As the Germans 
   close in on Stone, Mittens and Charlie, the aliens save the day and 
   kill the remaining Germans with their ray guns. Since their story 
   would never be believed by the public, Charlie ends up writing it for 
   Joey's favorite sci-fi pulp magazine. A fitting tribute.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="zone_troopers_1985c.htm">ZONE
    TROOPERS</A></B> is good-natured tale that is basically a low-budget 
   take-off on <B><A HREF="et_the_extra_terrestrial_1982.htm">E.T.: THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL</A></B> 
   (1982), but it's off-beat charms and unusual setting more than make 
   up for it's deficits (including some bad optical effects in the 
   finale). Director Danny Bilson (<B><A HREF="wrong_guys_1988.htm">THE 
   WRONG GUYS</A></B> - 1988, using nearly all the stars in this film), 
   who also co-wrote the script with producer Paul De Meo, tosses in 
   enough verbal and visual charm, especially in the dialogue between 
   the four Americans, they make the entire film a treat for fans of the 
   unusual. The only violence in this film is the constant gunplay (lots 
   of squibs with little blood) and Mittens' beating at the hands of a 
   German interrogator. The rest of the film is pure fantasy, especially 
   the subplot about Sgt. Stone, who earned the nickname &quot;The Iron 
   Sarge&quot; for his uncanny ability to survive when most would die. 
   After witnessing him being shot point-blank and surviving a direct 
   grenade hit and coming out of both of them without a scratch, you'll 
   be wondering if he, too, is also an alien. The entire cast of 
   excellent character actors do a nice job here, even Timothy Van 
   Patten, who would eventually put acting on the back burner and become 
   an Emmy Award-winning director of episodic television, as can be seen 
   in his great work on <B><A HREF="sopranos_tv.htm">THE SOPRANOS</A></B>.
    This is a one-of-a-kind film that should please fantasy fans. Also 
   starring Peter Boom, Max Turilli and William Paulson as the alien. A <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Lightning Video">Lightning
