    have been communicating with Steven for the past few years on a 
   fairly regular basis; he was the one who convinced me to review 
   mainly European fare in all genres and I thank him for that, as I 
   have discovered a lot of real gems among the filmic paste jewelry 
   that I wouldn't have known about without Steven's input (He also gave 
   me the courage to create a Spaghetti Western section). Steven always 
   makes me laugh, with his views on films, current events and anything 
   else that comes his way. He even sent me a list (a book, really) of 
   over 500 films he reviewed and when I was reading it, I was wiping 
   away the tears of laughter he evoked from me. I wanted Steven to 
   write for me for the longest time, but I was too scared to ask him, 
   thinking it would harm our friendship in some weird way which I only 
   understood. I finally got the nerve to ask him and he accepted. We 
   decided he would write reviews for films that I wouldn't touch with a 
   &quot;ten foot pole&quot;, since he watches films of all genres that 
   I wouldn't normally touch with a...well, you know. So sit back, relax 
   and prepare to be entertained, not only by Steven's hilarious 
   writing, but also his choice of films, many, I'm sure, you never 
   heard of before. And that's what this website is all about!</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's all the plot set-up we get at the start of the film which is 
   more concerned with giving us yet another universe creation origins 
   story like the first <B><A HREF="#Hercules1983">HERCULES</A></B> 
   film. This one involves Disco Space as usual, but for some reason 
   there's an eyeball looking out of a void like some sort of early 
   nineties techno video for good measure. You may remember Disco Space 
   from the first <B><A HREF="hercules_1983.htm">HERCULES</A></B> film, 
   or <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Starcrash">STARCRASH</A></B>, or

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We also have too sisters - Urania and Glaucia, who have set out to 
   find Hercules in order to get him to stop witchdoctor Venantino 
   Venantini sacrificing them to some fire monster (which looks like the 
   being from <B><A HREF="forbidden_planet_1956.htm">FORBIDDEN PLANET</A></B>).
    Most hilariously of all is Venantini's outfit, which is surely the 
   most ridiculous outfit he's ever been asked to wear. It looks like he 
   was going to go out to some Halloween party dressed as a Glam rocker, 
   but then decided at the last minute to go as a really flamboyant drag 
   queen, but then thought that wasn't far enough and stuck on Tina 
   Turner's hair as well.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film basically follows Herc as he goes around fighting monsters 
   who all have those lightening bolts inside them, which means we get a 
   never-ending parade of monsters for Hercules to punch in the face, 
   from the first monster who is so crap it resembles a very aggressive 
   shag pile carpet, to the bunch of guys who come out of a wall who all 
   looks like the 'green man' light you get at road crossings, to an 
   animated Medusa in a cave where a bunch of extras try to look like 
   they've been turned into stone but do a really terrible job at it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also thrown into the stew is the big return of William Berger as 
   King Minos! He gets brought back to life to kill Herc but instead 
   runs off to that weird place he lives (on a rock that looks like a 
   head in the middle of a lake in space), where he gets right down to 
   making his sidekick Daedelus make him some more technological rubbish 
   for him to throw at Herc. It didn't work in the last movie, but in 
   this film it somehow gives Berger the ability to kills gods, shoot 
   lasers from his eyes, and best of all, turn into Godzilla - in space!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    No doubt the highlight of this amazing film is the last act, where 
   Herc and his sidekick end up in a very strange land where Herc and 
   Minos go up into the stars, where Minos becomes Godzilla and Herc 
   becomes King Kong! Now, at this point I'd like to point out that 
   director Cozzi goes absolutely nuts in this film with the special 
   effects - those colourful Eighties ones we all know and love. Here, 
   everything frazzles with animated light, eyeballs flash, and when 
   Herc hits something, the whole screen goes either red or green. Nary 
   a second goes by without the use of effects, and it all leads to the 
   battle in space which I think actually gave me a nose bleed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And check out those crazy twins! Not Lou Ferrigno's undulating pecs, 
   but those cosmic freak winged kids one of the girls talks too. This 
   film is full of weird visuals in fact. Weird visuals, crazy monsters, 
   William Berger looking like he's about to burst out laughing, Claudio 
   Cassanelli looking like he's about to start crying (as usual), and 
   big Lou giving us one highly entertaining film. It's bad, but it's so 
   good. One of my favourites, along with the first one. Genuinely entertaining.</FONT></FONT></P>

   plot, with cold-hearted babes out to get their hands on some rich 
   guy's money, some duplicitous playboys with strong, bushy moustaches

   is swap the usual giant villa with the entire country of Gambia and 
   you have <B>THE AFRICAN DEAL</B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Big businessman (small actor) Enrico Maria Salerno wants to do a 
   deal with a Gambian businessman in order to get his hands on a lumber 
   business, but being quite shrewd, he personally hangs back in Italy 
   and sends some of his employees instead: Chief negotiator George 
   Hilton and his calculating wife Anita Strindberg, troubleshooter and 
   racist asshole Antonio, and young, sexy kept woman Yanti Somer (of 
   three Alfonso Brescia sci-fi films and Lucio Fulci's horror filled 
   children's film <B><A HREF="challenge_to_white_fang_1974.htm">THE 
   RETURN OF WHITE FANG</A></B> - where she burns to death!). This lot 
   immediately assume supremacy over everyone when they arrive, even 
   trying to get the logging company's representative Ruma to carry 
   their bags.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ruma (Calvin Lockhart - King Willie from <B><A HREF="predator_2_1990.htm">PREDATOR
    2</A></B>!), quickly proves to be much smarter than our four 
   Europeans...not that they would notice. Hilton is keen to meet the 
   elusive owner Kofi and strike a deal with him while trying to butter 
   up Ruma into revealing company secrets. Anita Strindberg tries to 
   come on to Ruma but is rebuffed, to which she is livid (she's not my 
   type either Calvin so don't sweat it - she resembles David Bowie to 
   me). Antonio just lords it over 'the blacks' while Yanti and Ruma 
   seem to be eyeing each other up.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Problems abound as it turns out that Yanti is Salerno's lover and is 
   there as some sort of present for logging magnate Kofi, but then Ruma 
   is charming her in his own way, showing her the terrible legacy the 
   Portugese wrought with bringing slavery to the country. This leads to 
   Yanti envisioning slavery back then, while walking about in said 
   visions. I liked when they did that in <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B>,
    and it works here too. Also, as always when you induce guilt-complex 
   fuelled visions in young ladies, Ruma's got Yanti in the sack right 
   after that. They also get it on up against a tree, leading to some 
   very awkward camera angles with both Lockhart and Somer staring 
   straight into the camera pulling sexual ecstasy faces. At least 
   Lockhart does. Somer looks like she's trying to choose between curly 
   or straight fries on a cafe menu but keeps thinking about something 
   else altogether, like David Cassidy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The interracial love tryst causes consternation among Salerno's 
   lackeys, with Antonio starting to scheme behind the scenes and 
   Strindberg getting into some hilarious bitching sessions with Somer. 
   Ruma also seems to be playing a game, introducing Somer to his boss 
   Kofi, testing Somer's love, and Salerno turns up, throwing everything 
   into confusion.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Strangely watchable as you get to see a bunch of priveliged assholes 
   get ring run around them by someone they perceive as inferior, <B>THE 
   AFRICAN DEAL</B> is the kind of film you'd watch when bored of an 
   afternoon. It's okay, but don't reserve a special time to watch it. 
   It's also nearly two hours long, like anyone asked for that. Hilton, 
   Salerno and Lockhart are pretty good here, but my major problem is 
   with <A HREF="african_deal_1973.htm#OST">Riz Ortolani's soundtrack</A>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">A
    plot that jumps back and forth in time. Absolute shitloads of 
   racism. Is this a Quentin Tarantino film? No, it's another Alberto 
   Cavallone joint, and as you would imagine, it's all over the place.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    YOU'RE DEAD</A></B>, the Formula 1 film <B><A HREF="le_mans_shortcut_to_hell_1970.htm">LE
    MANS - SHORTCUT TO HELL</A></B> and the OTHER Formula 1 film <B><A HREF="#FormulaOne1970">FORMULA
    1 - THE HELL OF THE GRAND PRIX</A></B>) comes to an Ethiopian Hotel 
   to meet a young lady. The two quarrel and Ivano stomps out, only to 
   shortly afterwards hear a gunshot. The police find the lady dead of a 
   gunshot wound to the head, and they also discover that the victim is 
   a post-op transgender person. The police turn up shortly afterwards, 
   and when a woman in the hotel reveals that she is the victim's sister 
   and she saw Ivano leave the room, the film decides to get a bad case 
   of the flashbacks. Some relevant to the mystery, other just so 
   Alberto Cavallone indulge in his usual shock tactics. So those 
   looking out for that needn't worry.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The dead person was once a young gay guy called Frank, a budding 
   poet who was getting hassled in school by nasty girls and guys with 
   rather shocking haircuts. One day, Frank gets kidnapped by his 
   schoolmates, taken out into the African shrubland, and gang-bummed by 
   the macho classmates (doesn't that also make them gay, or are they 
   the kind of guy you find in prison who think you're only gay if 
   you're on the receiving end)? Either way, Frank's treatment leads him 
   to meet Ivano, which leads to further flashbacks as Ivano invites him 
   to stay, much to the chagrin of Ivano's bitter, horny, often naked 
   wife. Oh, and that rape? It was organised by Frank's own father, who 
   wanted to teach him a lesson and make him more of a man (by having 
   him botted? You're sending mixed messages there buddy).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The sister (who has no problem with showering naked in the presence 
   of her father. What the fuck is it with these Alberto Cavallone 
   films?) works in a leper colony, so that gives Cavallone plenty of 
   chances to shows us the effects of leprosy too as an 'added bonus'. 
   He also throws in cow slaughter, a guy hand feeding a huge hyena (I 
   didn't think they were that big), and even starts the film with Ivano 
   witnessing two women being beaten and shot before the white policeman 
   in charge apologies for delaying him because 'he didn't realise he 
   was white'.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Frank and Ivano's relationship deepens as Ivano grows more distant 
   from his wife, who has history of seducing Ivano's mates and still 
   has the hots for him, which leads to her spending most of the film 
   naked and trying it on with a disinterested Ivano. That side of the 
   plot makes sense, but the rather expedition into the wilds of Africa 
   by Ivano, his wife, and all their friends doesn't add much, except to 
   show how horrible these people are as they insult the locals (one 
   woman asks upon seeing a breast-feeding native &quot;Is she giving 
   milk or coffee?&quot;, take part in native ceremonies (Ivano's wife 
   naked again), or just cheat on each other, including one woman 
   getting it on in front of her blind husband.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The mystery does eventually get solved, but I'm not revealing it 
   here. There's not much suspense in this film and not much mystery 
   either. Just a load of white people hating on each other while the 
   theme of colonialism is touched upon now and again when things get 
   slow. Who knows what Cavallone was trying to say here, but I've 
   thought that about every film I've watched of his. He went on to make 
   arty porno films before dying at the age of fifty-nine, having wanked 
   himself to death.</FONT></FONT></P>

   no dialogue, mainly because half the cast can't speak due to someone 
   else's genitals being stuffed in their mouths. I mean, the guy we're 
   meant to be rooting for starts out in a nice safe bunker full of 
   televisions, but what he likes best is to eat maggots and have sex 
   with a frozen cadaver. And he's the hero! And morally he's not even 
   close to the mad shit that goes on in this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film plot wise is a bit disjointed to say the least, but the 
   guy in the bunker finds a way out and while he's wandering about he 
   meets some of the locals, who immediately subdue him so that one of 
   them can arse-rape him (while some of the crowd knock one out - 
   remind me never to go to Belgium). Once that's done, he stumbles upon 
   a rich person's house where the owner forces a slave to give her 
   underwater cunnilingus, drowning them in the process. Our hero sneaks 
   off after that but gets caught by some farmer who keeps slaves to 
   work and rape, so our boy gets roped into that shit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This farmer isn't the best employer in the world, because it turns 
   out if you constantly whip and berate your employees, they will bash 
   your brains out with a giant piece of wood, and therefore our hero 
   gets to escape once again, only with a female companion that he has 
   sex with several hundred times over the duration of the film. That's 
   when they find the time between all the other sex scenes and rape.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And that's pretty much the format of the film - our hero and his new 
   wife travel the land, some people try to rape them, they find shelter 
   somewhere, and those people providing shelter try and seduce or rape 
   them. At one point the end up at a religious sanctuary where things 
   seem fine until the wife finds out that the monks are orally raping 
   the tenants and cutting their hearts out. They only have to impale a 
   guy through the throat with a pitchfork in order to easily escape.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As plotless as this is, there is some gore thrown in too - from 
   eyeballs being ripped from heads to people being impaled on spikes, 
   it's like the director just thought he'd throw loads of random 
   offensive crap together for a laugh. I didn't mind it so much, A more 
   upmarket critic would use the terms Grand Guignol and such like, but 
   I need a pish so that's the review.</FONT></FONT></P>

    More elaboration? Fine. Daniel Greene, who kind of looks like a 
   werewolf on the poster art for this one, is a happy-go-lucky 
   journalist who disgraced himself by faking executions in South 
   America somewhere that got some marines killed or something (I didn't 
   get that from the flashback to be honest, but that's what gritty, 
   angry editor Charlies Napier spits out). Now, he's tried to redeem 
   himself by getting some incriminating pictures of a corrupt senator 
   with a hooker, but Napier says the guy is so crooked they can't even 
   publish the story. Daniel resists, and gets himself a severe kicking 
   at the hands of some hired goons.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That plot line is dropped as soon as Daniel is sent to Argentina or 
   somewhere to keep out of trouble, under the premise that he's going 
   to film an ecological documentary on the native Condor, whereas in 
   fact he's off to find a downed plane flown by some guy who robbed 
   some jewels from China or some shit. It literally doesn't matter 
   because it gives Daniel the chance to go and stand near and/or fly 
   over glaciers, shag women, sock bad guys on the jaw and let fly some wisecracks.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    With crippled sidekick Brent Huff (from <B><A HREF="action.htm#StrikeCommando2">STRIKE

   a rival group searching for the treasure, fend off the repeated phone 
   calls from Napier about what the hells he's up to down there, and bed 
   several women based on the premise that he kind of looked at them 
   slightly, causing them to drop their drawers almost immediately, 
   because that's how things work in a world where a man has blow dried 
   hair, wears denim, and looks like someone burst Lou Ferringo with a fork.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Listen - if you are familiar with late Eighties Italian action 
   films, there's almost nothing I can tell you about this film that you 
   don't know already, even if you haven't watched it. Apart from a 
   native covering himself in yak fat to go diving, but other than that, 
   you have a cheesy synth score, dubious sexual politics, tepid action, 
   predictable twists, and that's about it. I liked it while hating it. 
   I watched it from a car with tinted windows, the film not knowing I 
   was watching. I called the film several times but didn't speak when 
   it answered. I entered the film's house while it was out, rummaging 
   through its underwear drawer. I loved it so I could not share it with 
   any other crappy film fan. I carved 'Danile Geerne is my God' 
   incorrectly on the side of a cow before crapping on the cow from a 
   tree and pushing it off a cliff. I constantly walked by the store 
   where the film worked, looking in on the film working at the tills, 
   over and over and over again. I received a restraining order which I 
   fried with butter and spinach and ate in the nude, staring at a 
   mosaic made of broken beer bottles, blood and semen that represented 
   the werewolf poster of the film. I kidnapped and restrained what I 
   thought was the film in a car park before realising that it was 
   selfless actor/wrestler Hulk Hogan wearing a 'After the Condor' wig, 
   who proceeded to almost beat me to death before the police 
   intervened. I spent the rest of my life in an insane asylum, covering 
   myself in yak butter and sticking my jaw out like Charlies Napier.</FONT></FONT></P>

   actors: Lina Romay! Ricardo Palacios!</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Pantomime-style
    antics here as Lina Romay, described by one character as a 'retarded 
   paralytic' lives a horrible existence at the hands of her evil 
   stepmother, her ugly aunt, and literally every single other character 
   in the film, save for the guitarist of a local band who tries to woo 
   her by scaring the crap out of her and making fun of her name.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Romay's got a whole heap of problems going on due to that old giallo 
   staple of being severely traumatised as a kid. This time, she 
   witnessed her father dying right in front of her, appearing with a 
   huge gash on his head, and despite of this she still asks &quot;Daddy,
    what's wrong?&quot;. His blood dripping on her legs has caused her 
   to lose the power of walking, given her horrific nightmares, and 
   pretty much driven her completely crazy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I can see why the stepsister and aunt are a bit tetchy due to all 
   the screaming and crying that Lina is doing, but to be fair it was 
   their fault, as they murdered her father in order to get his 
   inheritance, only to find that he'd left it all to Lina. Now all they 
   can do is get drunk and cackle like hags while mocking her, as does 
   Lina's Uncle Enrico, Enrico actually asks why the sisters haven't 
   just bumped Lina off yet and is so drunk he offers to do it himself. 
   That's when things get a bit strange...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You see, Lina's often staring into space, thinking about her dad and 
   what not, but when her dad himself appears to her, all bloody and 
   zombie like, things have gone next level weird. Her dad, with blood 
   dripping down his face, gasping her name, says that Lina can walk, 
   and tells her to go get vengeance on the people that killed him. So 
   it turns out Lina can walk, but only if mentally, she returns to the 
   age she was when her dad was killed. One stabbed up Enrico later, and 
   the sisters start to get edgy. Who killed Enrico? They suspect Lina, 
   but she can't walk...right? Enter Doctor Orgaf (Ricardo Palacios, 
   from a shitload of films, including <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PeopleOwnDark1975">THE
    PEOPLE WHO OWN THE DARK</A></B> and <B><A HREF="run_man_run_1968.htm">RUN,
    MAN, RUN</A></B>). Orgaf seems to know a lot more than he's letting 
   on, and may have even more sinister intentions than the sisters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Somehow, the cheaper and lesser a Jess Franco film is, the more I 
   like it, and I didn't mind this one that much. Maybe it's because 
   Lina Romay's character is surrounded by horrible human beings who see 
   her as an annoyance, and I was anticipating them getting their just 
   desserts, or maybe it was because of Lina being wheeled around in a 
   child's pram (!) rather than a wheelchair. The Gibraltar setting was 
   quite nice too, even though it reinforced my thoughts that there 
   doesn't seem to be much to do there except get robbed for food by a monkey.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now this is going to be hard to believe, but not once does Lina 
   Romay get naked in this film. Not once. A Jess Franco film without 
   Lina Romay's pubes is like buying a Big Mac and only getting the box. 
   Maybe she wanted to show off her acting talents by spending an entire 
   film crying and lying in bed, staring at stuff. I did get a few 
   laughs from her returning from her childlike murder states and 
   immediately losing the power of her legs.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I know nothing of the Jess Franco fan community so I don't know how 
   they rate this one, but it was okay. A few murders, some cheesy 
   acting. Loads of zooms.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Even the usually dependable Sergio Martino can't escape the curse of 
   late Eighties Italian horror. Sure, the film looks good, but the plot 
   makes about as much sense as any of Fulci's stuff made around the 
   same time, with two leading actors who seem to have wandered in from 
   an Umberto Lenzi movie like <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Welcome Spring Brea">NIGHTMARE
    BEACH</A></B> or <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#HitcherInTheDark">HITCHER 
   IN THE DARK</A></B>. That said, there are plenty of unintentional 
   laughs to be had in the last half hour, if you can get through a full 
   hour of Daniel Greene chasing after a guy over and over and over again.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot involves Scott Edwards, brainy graduate who inexplicably 
   pulls people around Miami in a Rickshaw. Scott's going nowhere in 
   life (kind of like the plot for a good while), but he's a kindly 
   sort, taking care of an old Chinese lady one day, who gives him a 
   mysterious locket he immediately forgets about. She also gives him a 
   note, but he drops it and rats eat it, meaning that it takes a long 
   time for him to guess what's going on, long after the audience has. 
   One night, he gives a rickshaw ride to a young stripper lady who 
   offers to provide him some nooky in exchange for the ride, on her 
   fancy yacht no less. Scott's pinching himself with glee but once they 
   get started, and brace yourself here, the old lady who is somehow 
   remotely watching psychically sends her cat over to screech and 
   reveal that there's a guy in the toilet filming Scott and the stripper!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Scott's enraged at this despite behind offered one hundred bucks for 
   a free shag and decides to fight with the guy instead, which results 
   in a key going flying out of a window and Scott retrieving the wrong 
   video tape. These two items and their location eat up a lot of time 
   in this film, as do the cops trying to figure out what's going on 
   (you and me both). When Scott returns to the yacht to get the real 
   video cassette, he finds the porno maker murdered and the tape 
   missing and unbeknownst to him, murderer Daniel Greene watching him 
   from his car. At this point the 'helpful' old lady sets fire to the 
   boat with her mind, while Scott is in it! You're just making things 
   worse dear, go far a nap or something.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rather than go on with the plot, which involves Scott running away 
   from Daniel Greene while Daniel Greene kills some of the cast and 
   uses the stripper to get at Scott, it's better just to skip to when 
   Donald Pleasence gets more involved, because that's where most of the 
   funny bits comes from. He's the principal bad guy of the film, and 
   I'm guessing Sergio Martino gave up making something good and just 
   elected to try and think of ridiculous things for Donald Pleasence to 
   do, like wearing a bad wig while his face is painted red or green or 
   fighting the world's fakest looking cat. Mind you, nothing tops the 
   end though, where Donald tries to make a speech while at the same 
   time oinking like a pig. You've got to give him credit for keeping a 
   straight face doing that. Him and every single other person in that scene.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Full of bollocks about Chinese folklore and astronomy, people 
   returning to the same location over and over again, Daniel Greene 
   appearing to be the only actor who seems to care about the film, some 
   gore, and two lead actors so crap I would have trouble picking them 
   out of a police line-up even though I just watched the film last 
   night, <B>AMERICAN RICKSHAW</B> is a low point for Sergio Martino, he 
   even fails to make it stupid enough to become a legendary bad movie 
   like <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Zombi 3">ZOMBI 3</A></B> or <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Troll 2">TROLL

    was one of those films I found on YouTube and decided to watch 
   without knowing anything about it, and I swear when the opening 
   credits started I thought I was going to be watching something made 
   in the nineteen-forties. However, the first shot of actual footage we 
   see is of a girl in bell-bottoms. The IMDB states this film was made 
   in colour, but the version I watched was black and white, and was so 
   blurry it was almost like it was made using old security cameras.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film itself involves a student named Ana being drafted in to 
   watch some rich people's children while they are away at some 
   conference or other, and although that's quite a hackneyed set-up 
   right there, the filmmakers go that extra distance in making every 
   single character Ana meets be as weird and/or odd as possible. First 
   off are the kids themselves - the daughter is very quiet and likes to 
   stare, while the son is chirpy and happy enough, but in a rather fake 
   fashion (as in he's smiling at Ana, but his eyes aren't). The mother 
   is very cold and standoffish, whereas the father sits in a room 
   listening to wonky classical music (that may have just been the 
   terrible copy I watched) while he just looks at Ana.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Worst of all is the groundskeeper, who does seem at least 
   superficially to be kind towards Ana, but when she not around him he 
   does an awful lot of staring into space. I suppose I kind of do the 
   same when I get five minutes peace but that's because I have two 
   children, one of whom plays Call of Duty with his headphones on, 
   screaming at the top of his voice, and the other relaying 
   incomprehensible anecdotes about things that happen on a thing called 
   Tik Tok. Then my wife shows up going on about such things as this 
   bill and that appointment, oblivious to the fact that I'm trying to 
   watch <B><A HREF="when_women_had_tails_trilogy_1970-1972.htm">WHEN

   looks so bewildered and lost. He was probably just trying to watch 
   the news when the constant noise and endless screaming drove him from 
   his house.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Despite not doing too bad in the babysitting stakes, things start to 
   get creepy when someone starts phoning Ana and telling her she'll be 
   dead by the end of the night. With no one to turn to but strange 
   people, Ana's not got much to do except panic like hell, but who is

    Nail-biting, riveting, and shit-yer-pants scary are...not words I'm 
   going to use to describe this film. It's not bad though, and it gets 
   rather bleak and horrible towards the end. There's no gore or nudity, 
   but a certain grim tone throughout. It's a short film too, which is 
   always good when you're in a hurry or have a family to look after.</FONT></FONT></P>

    To be honest, it's not really a giallo or gothic film at all, but it 
   does have a huge mystery at its centre and is set in an old house 
   full of secret and/or blocked off rooms, so we'll leave it at that. I 
   don't really want to say much about it either because like all good 
   mystery films the plot writhes all over the place, even though you 
   might guess some of what's happening before the end.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Young budding artist Tino heads for Venice to study and while there 
   he'll be staying with Uncle Vittorio Gassman (who steals the show by 
   far) and younger Aunt Catherine Deneuve. Both are welcome but there's 
   something 'off' about the whole dynamic between the two, and there's 
   also someone up in the attic in what Tino's Uncle calls 'The 
   Forbidden Room'. Tino finds himself embarking on a journey to find 
   out what's up in that attic, and even though it's revealed rather 
   early in the film, it's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to 
   secrets with this family.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Director Risi also throws a lot of strange elements into Vittorio's 
   dialogue, like how he thinks women smell of vegetables, speeches 
   about insects, and how certain books by certain authors don't like to 
   be next to each other on a shelf. His treatment of his wife is rather 
   weird too, as he tells her she should go out for a walk then telling 
   her its too cold, and constantly berating her for being stupid.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Vittorio Gassman makes this film with his seemingly staunch, 
   conservative character whom on closer inspection doesn't quite seem 
   so sharply turned out. Yet again, talking about his performance would 
   reveal major spoilers, so I'll just end by saying this is a weird 
   film worth tracking down.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Giraldi's sixth (!) outing takes a giallo form when a leading 
   industrialist type guy is stabbed in the back when the lights go out 
   during a meeting. Who killed the guy and why? Everyone attending is a 
   suspect, but an old man who was seen arguing with him prior to the 
   meeting is arrested as the prime suspect.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giraldi knows the guy who's been arrested and doesn't think he's 
   responsible, so he starts investigating all those who were in 
   attendance at the meeting, while also playing special attention to 
   the dead guy's attractive wife, whom he hits on merely three days 
   after the murder of her husband. Giraldi also gets to get it on and 
   possibly marry the prime suspect's daughter, but does he ever track 
   down the killer?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You know these Inspector Giraldi films are merely an excuse for 
   Tomas Milian to ham it up for laughs, right? The fairly standard 
   giallo plot (dead person, loads of red herrings, killer bumping off 
   witnesses) is just background noise for Milian to dress up in crazy 
   outfits, swear an awful lot, hit on women and do a bit of crazy slapstick.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At first I thought this one was a bit mild in these stakes until 
   Milian started chasing a suspect on horseback and the film turned 
   into a Western, with the horse remaining as a character for the rest 
   of the film and even ending up living with Milian (no mouse called 
   Serpico this time around). The highlight of the film for me was when 
   Milian has to get to one of the suspects, but in order to do so 
   enters a singing contest, which does with a cheeseball disco song 
   with drag artist backing singers. Be warned, however. I sent the link 
   of this scene to Fred and 'highlight' was definitely not included in 
   his expletive ridden response, so be warned. (<I>&quot;Lowlight&quot; 
   was more like it, d</I></FONT></FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">ouche</FONT></FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><I>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These are Milian's films all the way mind you, so if you like to see 
   him mouthing off to his superiors and acting like a horny fanny rat, 
   there's eleven of these Giraldi films just waiting for you. I read 
   that these films were so successful, the audiences would cheer when 
   he would mouth off to his boss, so at least we know that Italian 
   audiences are very easy to please.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Lizzani's <B>AT THE EDGE OF THE CITY</B> is nominally a noir-ish 
   murder mystery, but as usual there's hidden layers that reveal 
   themselves throughout the film that involve themes of middle class 
   ignorance of the poor and the desperation of the underclass to keep 
   their head above water, which results in a pretty good, almost 
   touching film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mario Ilari has been accused of murdering a woman called Marcella 
   but insists he's innocent. She was his lover in the past but claims 
   he broke off the relationship after his girlfriend Gina (Giulietta 
   Masina) tried to kill herself. If that's the case, why was Mario 
   spotted with Marcella on the night of her death, and why was his 
   knife used in the murder? A middle class lawyer with a snobby, icy 
   girlfriend takes on the case, with the help of his typist, an 
   educated girl from the same slums as Mario.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Roberto, the lawyer, meets Mario and tries to persuade him that 
   claiming that constant harassment led to him murdering Marcello, 
   saying that this might get the charges reduced to manslaughter. Mario 
   insists he's innocent but his distrust of everyone and reticence to 
   discuss what happened that night just makes him look more guilty. 
   Luisa the typist believes his story and along with Robert, they start 
   a little investigating of their own to try and weed out the real 
   killer. Roberto, however, isn't very good with dealing with working 
   class people.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Roberto and Luisa track down many witnesses and discover that a lot 
   of lies have been told to place Mario at the scene of the murder, but 
   obstacles stand in the way. One is a group of people who are 
   determined to make a certain person Mario claims to have met 
   seemingly not exist, and the other is Roberto's complete ignorance of 
   how to handle people he perceives to be beneath him (although his 
   intentions are good). He also doesn't realised that Luisa is in love 
   with him, preferring to hang about with his snobby girlfriend who 
   sees the underclasses as an irritant.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As usual with a Carlo Lizzani film, the tone is deadly serious, but 
   the subtleties are...subtle. The glimpse into how the homeless live, 
   and those in the slums, is fascinating, as they have a social system 
   far more honest than those of the middle class lawyers, who will use 
   any method to undermine each other. Also, how can a lawyer defend a 
   client that he believes is guilty in the first place? There might be 
   the odd dull patch here and there (like the sub-plot about Luisa 
   being in love with Roberto) but overall the shanty town setting and 
   mystery win through.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For reasons unknown, Carlo Lizzani killed himself at the age of 91 
   by jumping from the balcony of his apartment in Rome, which is 
   coincidentally on the same street Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso 
   store is located.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Here was me thinking I'd stumbled upon some rare erotic giallo from

   in Italy to be one of the worst films of all time. I can't argue with 
   that opinion either, but when you've got Eva Grimaldi kicking a

   her. </FONT></FONT><BR>

   A couple of years later she's released, and discovers that her 
   ex-boyfriend now has the jewels, which enrages her.&nbsp; Finding him 
   is going to be a problem however, as he's fallen head-over-heels in

   sexy striptease at her apartment.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   You see, Eva has chosen a career over her now ex-husband Philippe, 
   and his psychotic mother Anita Ekberg spends the rest of the film 
   trying to kill Eva. Also, Eva's employer is Burt Young (also 
   appearing in <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CircleOfFear1992">CIRCLE OF FEAR</A></B> 
   around this time), and he's big on sexual harassment in the workplace 
   but it's the early nineties so Eva just brushes that shit off.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Brian the stripper gets hired because Eva wasn't quite happy with the 
   vibrator her co-workers bought her, and as Ekberg attacks Eva's 
   apartment with a hatchet (which she then throws about three hundred 
   yards into a tree!), and as Florence is now sniffing around the strip 
   club looking for Brian, they have to hide out in an erotic hotel with 
   penis-shaped keyrings and make sexy time in a way that's about as 
   sexy as filling in complex insurance documents. </FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   And it just gets worse, as Eva and Brian fall in love go on a road 
   trip while being chased by Florence, who is being chased by 
   Thumbelina (who also gives a mentally challenged man a blowjob while 
   he's driving in one of the more challenging scenes in the film), 
   while Anita Ekberg is crazily bringing up the rear. It's as good as 
   it sounds. </FONT></FONT><BR>

   Bad erotica mixed with terrible comedy jarring uneasily with 
   violence, suicide and a dark ending (what?). I don't think there's an

   suffer through the shrill, rapid Italian dialogue. I was slack-jawed

    off land, some narrator goes on about some tribe that end up being 
   travelling entertainers who have some magical ruby with them, but 
   let's face it - it's a load of old bollocks. What we have is a bunch 
   of circus performers in wagons being chased by evil warlord Richard 
   Lynch's cronies, which leads to a fairly good, gory battle where the 
   circus folk hold their own (using the tools of their trade) before 
   inevitably failing miserably. Among the circus is Queen Canary 
   (Virginia Bryant, whom you won't remember from <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Demons3-Ogre1989">DEMONS
    3: THE OGRE</A></B> because like everyone else, you fell asleep

   and Kutchek, and a girl called Kadia or something. Queen Canary has

   Lynch if he'll spare the kids.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lynch says they won't die by his hand or any of his cronies, which 
   is a fairly loaded statement to make. For Canary it's all she's 
   getting though - so while she thrown into a cage, the twins are 
   separated, each told the other died, then trained for years on end by 
   an hysterical, screaming Michael Berryman for a showdown in many 
   years time, when the both of them have transformed into what only be 
   described as a fairly loud hair-metal hybrid of <B><A HREF="conan_the_barbarian_1982.htm">CONAN

    The two twins recognise each other and rather than kill each other, 
   they scream in each other's faces a bit, and escape. They also hook 
   up with thief Eva La Rue and try and lead the tribe of circus folk 
   back to glory. While one of them honks like some sort of hog and both 
   of them immediately forget what they're supposed to be doing every 
   time a naked woman appears before them. As if having two hollering, 
   dumbass, sweaty-arse crack goofballs descending on him isn't bad 
   enough, Lynch also has to contend with his cronies getting annoyed at 
   him falling in love with Queen Canary, and planning a little 
   rebellion of their own.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's the plot right there, give or take, but we all know it's the 
   stupidity levels and set pieces that make the film, so watch out for 
   one of the twins getting involved in an arm-wrestling match with 
   George Eastman, the twins having a goof around with a head they've 
   just torn off some monster, and the twins taking on what's supposed 
   to be a dragon, but what really looks like the long-term unemployed,

    He may have been the perennial bad guy, but I kind of miss Richard 
   Lynch in these roles. In spite of his racially offensive throne that 
   puts Xerxes' staircase from <B><A HREF="300_2006.htm">300</A></B> to 
   shame, he plays the bad guy like a kind of mixed up, misguided tyrant 
   who can't quite go the whole way in being evil, but can't quite 
   redeem himself either. It lends the film a certain depth that somehow 
   we don't get from two goons flapping about hooting and slagging each 
   other off. Not that I'm knocking the twins - it's this half-arsed 
   approach to seriousness that makes the film so enjoyable.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   piazzas. In the real world, he acts up to Senta Berger and 'Uncle' 
   Mario Erpichini (who gets a rather notable death in Enzo Castellari's <B><A HREF="high_crime_1973.htm">HIGH
    CRIME</A></B>). He also has a kind of early girlfriend in the shape 
   of Olga, a neighbour who suggests that Gianluca's parent may be going 
   through a divorce.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Socially, it turns out that being driven to your new school by a 
   chauffeur isn't the best idea, as Gianluca becomes a target for 
   bullies. A local boy, Marco, takes umbrage at the presence of a 
   millionaire's son, but when Gianluca doesn't grass him in for a 
   beating that's given out, the two embark on a bromance where they try 
   and finance a trip for Gianluca to go to Milan to find his father. 
   This also involves a local crazy person known as the Red Baron who 
   lives on the beach and gives lectures about dog fights he's been 
   involved in. Most notable of all (for those who haven't read the 
   wikipedia page for this film) is that his personal theme tune is also 
   the theme tune to the popular US comedy <B><A HREF="curb_your_enthusiasm_hbo_series_2000.htm">CURB
    YOUR ENTHUSIASM</A></B>, a show I have never watched but am 
   nonetheless aware of due to the overuse of the theme tune in memes on YouTube.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As far as I'm aware, this kind of film is well known in Italy, so 
   you can expect a set up in the first third of the film, some comedy 
   in the middle, and some horrific tragedy in the last third, and that 
   is what happens here. I was curious to watch this one as I'm always 
   curious to see how these genre directors handle films outwith the 
   parameters within which we know them for, and safe to say that 
   Martino carries this one off perfectly. It's not my type of film at 
   all, but Martino films it's beautifully, filling the screen with 
   strange angles and plenty of primary colours, mixing that with some 
   expert editing when Gianluca lapses into his flashbacks with his dad.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The tearjerking part is also well executed, with Gianluca's friends 
   standing out in the rain, anxiously watching a hospital window. Good <A HREF="beautiful_summer_1974.htm#SummerToRemember">soundtrack</A> 
   too, although I doubt many people are going to want to track this 
   down, or even want to read this review. The stuttering pimp from 
   Dario Argent's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BirdCrystalPlum1970">BIRD

   George Eastman is going to be appear in leather to bum-rape Giancarlo 
   Prete, because this is serious drama post-apocalyptic stuff. With 
   only five characters. Set almost entirely on beach. Luckily, we have 
   a bunch of actors that are a joy to watch, so the film's pace is 
   rather quick, considering.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A nuclear war has ravaged the Earth, and family man Philippe Leroy 
   keep his hot wife Irene Papas and serious, introspective son Patrick 
   well away from the irradiated cities. Instead, they live in a caravan 
   on a beach, where Philippe goes out out fishing every day, despite 
   have had his hands destroyed when the bombs dropped. This perhaps is 
   maybe why he's not so interested physically in Irene, which is going 
   to work out bad for when out of the blue Gabriele Tinti and Frank 
   Wolff turn up.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Irene doesn't even try to hide her desire when she and Tinti start 
   making eyes at each other (Wolff tries it on too, but fails, badly). 
   A strange dynamic falls on the group as Irene learns that those 
   destroyed, poisonous cities Philippe has been telling her about are 
   clean, and Philippe seems to understand that Irene is about to dump 
   him for Tinti, so tries stirring things up between Wolff and Tinti, 
   while Wolf and Philippe clash as Wolff wants to rebuild society, 
   whereas Philippe thinks what remains of the human race should just 
   shrivel up and die. The kid, for the most part, gets almost 
   completely forgotten about, and I'm sure that was intentional, as is 
   the general misanthropic tone of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also adding to the air of nihilism and isolation is Ennio 
   Morricone's often minimalist soundtrack, with Western twangs mixed 
   with percussion, lone flutes, and wailing voices (most prominent when 
   Irene Papas and Gabriele Tinti are doing a bit of skinny dipping, so 
   you get to see Irene's Papas). The constant shots of empty landscapes 
   and the sea further add to the general atmosphere of the film being 
   'not full of jolly japes'.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Acting wise, you can't go wrong with any of the actors here. Wolff 
   is eccentric and moody, where Leroy is just plain moody. When he 
   first sees that there are new people in his life, he seems to know 
   instantly that he's lost everything, and does well to convey that 
   despair. It's Irene Papas that steals the show for me though, 
   probably because she's given the most to do - acting bored, lustful, 
   and at times, completely insane at the situation.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I'd been after this one for years and it turned up on Youtube a

    Florence isn't really enjoying her marriage to Luciano any more. 
   There's just something about pretending to be a prostitute in a hotel 
   and having him stick a gun barrel in her proud mary and play Russian 
   roulette while he held a pillow over her face that she just didn't 
   like, so now she's hitting the road and Luciano can go find someone

    You've got to love the way Stefano approaches the situation - he 
   gives it the old 'hey baby, you look hot' routine, tells her he's 
   been watching her for days, follows her to the bar, offers her a 
   cigarette and starts stroking her thigh. Just look back on that 
   sentence and imagine a guy trying that these days. I'm not even sure 
   that would have worked back in the Eighties, but in this film, it 
   does! Even better is when Stefano turns out to be a plant just so

    OWN PRIVATE IDAHO</A></B> [eh?]). Florence gives Robert the brush 
   for at least a few minutes before the two of them fall in love, which 
   means we're treated to a 'love montage' as they drive around the 
   beach, run about laughing, and make sweet sweet love on the beach.

   and by that he means up your arse crack!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Speaking of arse crack, I hope you like Robert Egon's arse because 
   it should really have it's on separate screen credit, the amount of 
   time it appears in this film. You see, there are really two Lucianos 
   in this film. There's the real one that's messing with Florence's 
   head, and then there's the one in Florence's head that keeps telling 
   her that her relationship with Robert isn't filthy enough and that 
   she needs to dirty things up a bit, which leads Florence to jamming a 
   hairbrush up Robert's arse without warning, or, indeed, any kind of 
   lubrication. Robert, to put it mildly, is not pleased.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We all know however that when young lovers fall out there's always 
   the joy of make-up sex, and I'm sure we've all shook up cans of full 
   sugar coke and poured them all over each other before making even 
   more sweet sweet love to someone's big toe, the most sensitive part 
   of a person's body. And this film is in no way finished with being 
   stupid yet, because Florence and Robert (mainly Florence) decide to 
   gender swap to get back at Luciano, which means Robert Egon has to 
   dress in drag and perv himself up in an apartment across the road 
   from Luciano's office, although it's more funny earlier than, as a 
   test, Florence arranges for Robert to meet all his friends in a bar. 
   Somehow they don't notice that he's there, even though he looks 
   exactly the same, only with lipstick on.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm leaving out Luciano's side of things and the out of nowhere plot 
   twist at the end. For a film that sets out to be sleazy and 
   psychological, there's a fair dollop of cheese on top by way of 
   Florence and Robert's flirting and the saxophone-led soundtrack. The 
   stupidity of the situations onscreen is enough to carry the film 
   through. Not that it's any good, but worth a few laughs. Just don't 
   watch it with the missus or she might come at you with a hairbrush.</FONT></FONT></P>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Well,
    they sure don't make them like this anymore. Shelley Winters plays a 
   Sicilian woman who moves to mainland Italy with her son and takes up 
   residence in an apartment block, quickly making friends with three 
   spinsters and caring for her husband, who unfortunately has a stroke 
   on their first day there and becomes paralysed. Sounds like a pretty 
   solid drama, eh? Like one of those 'painful lives' books that are 
   inexplicably popular.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It would be, if Winters wasn't an overprotective psychopath and her 
   son wasn't a fully grown Antonio Marsina, the only survivor of 
   thirteen children whom Winters believes she has stolen from death. 
   Plus, the three sisters are all played by perfectly by men, for no 
   reason I can discern, and all three do their job perfectly, 
   especially Max Von Sydow, who revels in the role of sensitve, caring 
   Lisa, whose fretful nature jars with Sydow's huge figure. Lisa, by 
   the way, is also haunted by nightmares of being raped by the Devil. 
   You also have Stella, the melancholy lady who has been unlucky in 
   love and years to return to the US to seek out her ex-husband, and 
   Berta, a sarcastic singer. All three bond with Winters pretty 
   quickly, which is good for her as they know the gossip on everyone, 
   including that pretty dancer who has been sniffing around Marsina.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Winters is one of those mothers who thinks there is no woman out 
   there that's good enough for her son, and she's also getting a bit 
   cagey about the upcoming war that Marsina is possibly going to get 
   called up for. Thinking Death is now going to get what is rightfully 
   his, Winters starts to panic, then flat out goes nuts when she 
   catches Marsina in bed with Laura Antonelli (from the horrible <B><A HREF="bali_1970.htm">BALI</A></B> 
   and the obscure giallo <B><A HREF="la_gabbia_1985.htm">LA GABBIA</A></B> 
   which I have yet to track down). Like any right-thinking person, 
   Winters thinks that she can control the situation by flat out 
   murdering those spinsters as some sort of sacrifice to Death. Roping 
   in her mentally handicapped servant (Milena Vukotic from <B><A HREF="house_of_the_yellow_carpet_1983.htm">THE

   THE YELLOW CARPET</A></B>, who is great here), Winters first selects 
   Stella (as she is leaving the country), cuts her head off, and turns 
   her flesh into soap and her bones into powder that she then makes 
   into biscuits and feeds to everyone.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The absurdity of the film is played up for laughs, and it gets 
   really absurd and sick, as Winters tries to lure Marsina away from 
   Antonelli by sending in her totally naked, handicapped servant into 
   Marsina's room to seduce him (he's too much of a good guy though), 
   and also dries a fully naked Marsina off after he's had a bath. 
   There's some slight gore here and there too - blood splatters, 
   boiling flesh, but this is really a comedy of the blackest kind. It 
   reminded me strongly of the British comedy <B><A HREF="league_of_gentlemen_british_tv_series_1999-2017.htm">THE
    LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN</A></B>, with the cast playing characters of 
   both genders (I meant to say that all three spinsters return as male 
   characters as the film goes on), and having a similar domestic horror 
   feel about it. <B>LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN</B> co-writer Mark Gatiss is a 
   fan of Italian cinema, even covering it in his documentary about 
   Horror Films (<B><A HREF="horror_europa_with_mark_gatiss_2012.htm">HORROR
    EUROPA WITH MARK GATISS</A></B> - 2012), so it could be he caught 
   this film at some point.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's a delight to watch Max Von Sydow in this one, but Shelley 
   Winters completely steals the show as Lea, the crazy mother. She's 
   not a raving lunatic, she's just a disturbed individual following 
   some kind of internal logic that only she understands, and the way 
   she matter-of-factly prepares rooms for murder and cleans up 
   afterwards is brilliant. She truly does love her son and will do 
   anything to protect him, even if it means killing (and not just the 
   spinsters either).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sometimes you hear about a film and hope it's as crazy as it sounds, 
   and this one is. It might be too talky for some, but not for me.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Marc discovers that his cousin Anna Maria is a prostitute in the 
   worst way possible - by finding that out after he's shagged her, 
   courtesy of his uncle. His uncle is oblivious to this and only wanted 
   Marc to blow off some steam after being in jail for so long, so he 
   gave him some money to go to the local brothel. Turns out that Marc 
   was in love with her as a teenager and now he's got to go back to

   friend Nosey, signs up to do some work for Don Cicio in exchange for 
   Anna Maria, but can he trust a violent criminal? And will George

    Apart from all the inter-cousin action, quality funky music and 
   overload of female nudity, this film takes ages to get violent, 
   coasting along on punch-ups and robberies before shots are fired. 
   This isn't too much of a bad thing as the film has a habit of 
   distracting us with loads of naked women, from both female leads to 
   random strippers, Don Cicio's junky girlfriend, whose actions forward 
   the plot more than anyone else in the film, get naked a couple of

   much crime apart from kidnap relatives of Marc Porel and try to

    is definitely one of Alfonso Brescia's better films, and a solid 
   enough Eurocrime film. It ticks all the boxes with the gun battles, 
   car chases and naked babes anyway, even if the plot is a little thin.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Seven-foot-ten George Eastman must have asked Alfonso Brescia what 
   his character's motivation was in this film, and the answer must have 
   been 'your character smokes', because that's literally all you are 
   going to get there. He's a man bent on revenge as he's returned to 
   Philly to avenge the death of his cop father, who has been accused of 
   being corrupt and involved with the mob. Someone doesn't want George 
   to find out, as the moment he steps off the plane, which he was 
   having a nice relaxing smoke on, a bunch of pretend-terrorists open 
   fire on him, and just about anybody else that's around, resulting in 
   a nice opening shootout that's probably the best part of the film, 
   especially when George shoots a bad guy carrying explosives and the 
   guy explodes! The police are amazingly understanding about all this, 
   but they also know why George is back in Philly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One other guy who knows is mobster friend Jack Palance (whom, I 
   realised, has a face like an armed robber who has worn panty hose on 
   his head so many times his face has just decided to remain squashed 
   looking forever). Jack at first guns down a couple of guys waiting to 
   ambush George, and seems to be helping out just because Palance was 
   mates with Eastman's dad, but he may have some other nefarious reason 
   for grinning like a freak while gunning down shitloads of mobsters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The general storyline basically goes as follows - Eastman goes to a 
   certain location on a hunch or a tip, or to meet an informer, and 
   gets either ambushed or his informer gets murdered. He can't even 
   visit childhood sweetheart Jenny Tamburi (from <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SmileBeforeDeath72">SMILE

   I'm horrified to discover that there's more than one 'Italian Style' 
   film out there) without getting into a punch-up. It's a case of wash, 
   rinse, repeat, but this time around Brescia does a good job of 
   keeping things fresh, like Eastman having a huge punch-up in a bar 
   that's intercut with a striptease, or having a shoot-out take place 
   in pitch darkness where only Eastman knows the layout of the room.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's loads of action in this one, and the end battle is quite 
   epic. I can't even believe I'm saying these things about an Alfonso 
   Brescia film, but there you go. In those Mario Merola films things 
   were padded out with Merola's songs and Luciano Montaldo's screaming, 
   so I guess in this one Brescia had to make do with putting some 
   action in there. Neither Eastman or Palance are that great at acting, 
   but both are perfectly watchable here.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   what happened to her husband and who did it, because one night a 
   local thug Acicatena burst into her house and killed her husband with 
   a shotgun due to his involvement as a witness in a Mafioso trial. 
   Yet, no one will come forward as a witness and three years later, she

    Enter socialist Marcello Mastroianni, who has returned to Sicily to 
   live with his mother (their scenes together are pretty much the only 
   source of humour in the film). Since his father died, Marcello has 
   become a rich landowner, but his political leanings may get him into 
   trouble due to the rise of Mussolini and the fascists, of which the 
   murderous Acicatena has become leader of the local branch. It also 
   doesn't help that Marcello stops Acicatena from raping Loren after 
   she fails to kill him. Not put off by Marcello's disgusting long 
   beard, she makes love with him by way of gratitude.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It seems that out in those roasting hot Sicilian hills you can't 
   just start one love affair without another one starting up, because 
   complicating things are the arrival of cocky, rich gangster Giancarlo 
   Giannini, just returned from the US to do some smuggling business. He 
   was Loren's husband's cousin, and it could be that he's fixing to 
   take out Acicatena, but then again, he also falls in love with Loren, 
   who soon finds herself pregnant. Will she choose the chivalrous 
   Mastroianni or the passionate Giannini, who promises to take her away

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Well fleshed-out characters and top-tier acting (as expected from 
   the Italian acting royalty involved) make this a pretty good watch. 
   Sofia Loren's inexhaustible rage and inner turmoil carries the film 
   while both the introspective Mastroianni and the flamboyant, but 
   dangerous, Giannini support her well while their own strange 
   relationship develops (Mastroianni's rich father basically set the 
   course for Giannini's life by making his father, then himself, work 
   in a sulphur mine). All the while, Turi Ferro's Acicatena is a vile, 
   smug creature who thinks he's untouchable, which sets up a very tense 
   scene later when Giannini calls him out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For some reason the scene where Mastroianni is having dinner with 
   his mother stands out. It has no real bearing on the film but when 
   his mother scolds him for getting sauce on his shirt and Mastroianni 
   counters this by pouring sauce all himself struck me as pretty funny. 
   Maybe that was needed because the film gets gradually darker and more 
   violent until the outstanding ending, which happens to be both very 
   violent and very touching.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Luckily, while at the library looking for UFO books, he stumbles on 
   Patsy Kensit researching flying saucers (should have been researching 
   acting Pasy) and the two hit it off. Well, that's what they're trying

   what happens when you add water to...water.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most of the film features Face looking up at the things, arguing 
   with his bosses, and talking UFOs with Patsy, so it's no real 
   surprise to find out that this bore-fest takes forever to get back to 
   that mountain, and it's tepid as hell. Cheap looking too. His voice

    I was going to say that Face was the first A-Team person to end up 
   in an Italian film, but now I've got a feeling that George Peppard 
   probably featured in some late sixties Italian war film (I can't be 
   bothered checking). And Mister T was no doubt in a giallo while 
   Murdoch probably just got bummed in some Joe D'Amato porno.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Roberto's wife has run off and left, and no fucking wonder. He's a 
   narcissistic dickhead for starters, and a contrary bastard too. He's 
   tracking down his wife, but at the same time he manages to try and 
   bed every woman he sees. Roberto's adventure starts in Tahiti, where 
   he stoats about acting like a total twat looking for his wife Marita 
   (Haydee Politoff). He finds her location from Swedish tourist Susanne 
   (but he can't understand why she would go to somewhere so backward). 
   He also tries to get it on with her, but she changes her mind, then 
   changes her mind again after Roberto slapping her about a bit turns 
   her on (more reasons to hate this film).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It turns out that Marita has gone off to somewhere called Bora Bora 
   and has remarried. What's the first thing Roberto does when he sets 
   eyes on Marita? He slaps the shit out of her, that's what. He also 
   around this time turns out to be a racist too, gets to the village 
   Marita's staying in before her, tells her husband that Marita slept 
   with him, then demands to drink coconut juice, has Marita's husband 
   fetch him one, drinks a little bit and then tosses the coconut away.

   just gets worse from here on in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Upon seeing that Marita (and we'll get to her shortly) is happy and 
   content, Roberto decides that he's going to get married and live 
   there too, which results in him seducing a local girl and generally 
   hanging around the place while the locals build him a new house. And 
   he insults them when they're doing it too! It also starts becoming 
   evident that Marita isn't totally over Roberto and that they've been 
   playing sick mind games with each other since they were teenagers.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Ugo Liberatore then decides that Bora! Bora! Bora! isn't shit enough

   fuck's sake!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Worse still, and this is the equivalent of Ugo Libertore coming 
   round to your house, offering to make you a coffee, then rubbing his 
   foreskin around the rim of your cup in secret then giggling as you 
   drink it in front of him, Marita goes home with Roberto! I don't 
   usually spoil films, but this one offended me to my core. There's no 
   pay off! Roberto, through a serious of passive-aggressive and 
   outright aggressive actions, gets his way in the end, with no 
   retribution, as it seems that Marita had intended that to be the case 
   all along.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    In Rome, two siblings (Ugo Tognazzi and Mariangela Maleto) are 
   landlords that own a huge apartment complex in the middle of Rome. 
   They are delighted because one of the tenants has just died, and that 
   means that they are one step closer to achieving their goal - once 
   all the tenants leave, or are evicted, or die, they can sell the 
   complex for 500 million lire so that property developer can build on 
   the site. They even keep a scoreboard on their wall and cross out the 
   name of the tenant once they are gone (Maleto hates one tenant so 
   much she crosses them off dozens of times). There's a couple of 
   problems this duo are facing, however...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One is that the siblings hate each other and find it hard to 
   sometimes occupy the same room. Maleto is a huge giallo fan and has 
   to often hide her crime books from Tognazzi, because when he finds 
   them he tears out the page that reveals the killer and eats it! The 
   two often also fight over food, which we see during a sequence where 
   they are spying on two men in a restaurant where one sibling keeps 
   stealing what they both perceive as being the larger of two 
   hamburgers from the other's plate when their back is turned. The 
   other problem is the tenants themselves, or mainly, the tenant's 
   rights they have that prevents them all from being thrown out into 
   the street.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Four paragraphs in and I haven't mentioned the cat yet - that'll 
   give you an indication of how much is packed into this film. The cat 
   belongs to the hate-filled siblings, and it's just as vindictive and 
   petty as the both of them. It's through the cat (and a nicely fluid 
   sequence) where we meet the remaining tenants of the building. As the 
   cat strolls from apartment to apartment (and driving everyone nuts), 
   we get to meet Philippe Leroy the priest, whom Maleto is trying to 
   seduce so Tognazzi can blackmail him with discreetly taken pictures), 
   Dalila Di Lazzaro, a secretary whom Tognazzi has the hots for who 
   seemingly transcribe telephone conversations for her corporate boss 
   every night, then there's the old age chamber music group, the 
   secretive chess teacher, and a journalist. There's a lot of people to 
   keep track of in this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot itself kicks off when the cat is murdered one night, 
   prompting the siblings to go the bumbling cops with the dead cat in a 
   bag and demand the police do an autopsy on the cat (!) and open up a 
   murder case. When the police refuse, the two of them start their own 
   investigations, and we get to see what the people in the apartment 
   complex are really up to as many secrets are revealed, the plot take 
   many sharp turns into different territories, and everything is neatly 
   tied up when they finally solve the cat's murder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film is absolutely brilliant from start to finish, jam-packed 
   with twists and reveals throughout it's duration. I'm not going to 
   reveal much here at all in order to be fair to the film, but expect 
   nudity, gunfights, drugs, actual laughs (sometimes Italian comedy 
   doesn't translate well into English - the references and analogies 
   get lost), and a performance so great from Mariangela Maleto that she 
   received some sort of reward for it. I actually burst out laughing 
   when Tognazzi slammed a car door on a corpse's hand in a panic. 
   Italian comedies are very hit and miss because sometimes the 
   slapstick is beyond silly, but not here.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mario Brega's not in it much though, so fans of him might be let 
   down. This is yet another film I know of because of the soundtrack,

    My kids thought it would be fun to hold me captive and make me watch 
   this one, but the joke was soon on them as I knew what I was getting 
   into, but then soon after that the joke was on all of us as a bunch 
   of CGI cats with actors faces floating on them jumped around the 
   screen, gibbering the word 'Jellicle' over and over and over again 
   for a full one hour forty-five minutes of hardcore cringe.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After the ordeal was over, I was straight on the internet to see if 
   there was some sort of plot I might have missed because we were all 
   screaming in pain so much, and to see if the stage musical was as bad 
   as the film. The stage version is definitely a lot gayer than the 
   cinematic version, but I'd much rather see loveable actor John 
   Partridge bouncing around stage belting out (or maybe miming) songs 
   than watch Rebel Wilson eat dancing cockroaches and flinging her legs asunder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot involves a cat called Victoria getting dumped in an 
   alleyway where other dumped cats live (probably because they won't 
   stop fucking singing!) and Victoria being indoctrinated into their 
   weird cat cult, which involves saying Jellicle every three seconds or 
   so until the head cat (Judi Dench, who looks more like a lion) makes 
   the Jellicle Choice, which means (my keyboard actually stopped 
   working there - even it hates this film) - which means that they pick 
   whatever cat they think sung a song about themslves the best and fire 
   them off into the atmosphere in a balloon/chandelier combo to die. So 
   that means that an almost endless parades of cats appear, sing a song 
   about themselves, then get turned into dust by Idris Elba and 
   teleported to a barge on the Thames where Ray Winstone the singing 
   cockney cat awaits. Yes, Ray Winstone. I wondered aloud why he was in 
   the film. &quot;Maybe he's developed dementia&quot; my wife said.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rebel Wilson turns up to sing about being a &quot;Gumbie&quot; cat, 
   Inexplicably popular James Fucking Corden turns up to sing his song, 
   &quot;Obnoxious Fat Prick&quot;. &quot;I'm an obnoxious fat prick/Yes 
   an obnoxious fat prick/Thank fuck I'm only in the film/For about five 
   minutes&quot;, Imagine being the poor guy who had to wash James 
   Fucking Corden's green screen suit after all that dancing. He's 
   probably dead now. Idris Elba continues his run of baffling career 
   choices including the almost equally terrible <B><A HREF="dark_tower_2017.htm">DARK

   by playing Macavity, who wants to be the cat they fire into the sky 
   after the Jellicle Choice, but Taylor Swift sings his song, called 
   &quot;Let's Just Say Macavity A Whole Bunch of Times&quot;. Which is 
   similar to the song &quot;Let's Say The Name Mephistophiles A Bunch 
   Of Times&quot; which appears later in the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    My son was running around singing &quot;I'm a genital cat/A genital 
   cat&quot; after this film and its taken a full hour of Fortnite to 
   help him forget it. Other lyrics we came up with were &quot;Everybody 
   Buggers Rum Tum Tugger&quot;, and &quot;It's been such a wonderful 
   Jellicle night/Now I'm off for a Jellicle shite&quot;. I see some 
   positive reviews on the IMDB state that folks that don't like it just 
   don't like musicals, but that's bollocks, because I love <B><A HREF="jesus_christ_superstar_1973.htm">JESUS
    CHRIST SUPERSTAR</A></B>. I can sing &quot;What then to do with this 
   Jesus of Nazareth&quot; EXACTLY the way the guy sings it in the film. <B>CATS</B> 
   has none of the camp value that the stage version has, none of the 
   energy either. It seems that in the stage version the performers just 
   play up the ridiculous nature of the plot, but it just comes across 
   as really fake and false in the film version, with next to nothing to 
   pin anything emotional on. It's pretty hard to feel anything when the 
   most famous song, Memories, is sung by a CGI cat with a human face 
   with snot running down it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Hanging around outside a cave in Northern Italy, farm girl Rossana 
   Schiafinno is kind of flirting with Alpini Nino Castelnuovo, who has 
   been given the task of guarding a German supply dump hidden in a 
   cave. Nearby, UK General Brian Aherne has just been captured by the 
   Germans due to the lack of defence from Captain Larry Hagman. Driving 
   John Saxon puts up a fight and is wounded, but all three are captured 
   when suddenly passing planes start an ariel bombardment.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Saxon, Hagan, Aherne, one surviving German, Nino and Rossana, plus 
   an escaped Canadian POW make it into the cave. but for reasons I've 
   already forgotten the Germans blow up the entire hillside, destroying 
   the land and burying everyone under tonnes of rubble. Luckily for 
   them the cave is full of food and water, oil and bedding, and, 
   unknown to all except alcoholic Larry Hagman (I ain't going there), a 
   huge stash of Vecchia Romagna brandy, a very fine brandy that's 
   traditionally given by sons to their fathers. I would have kept that 
   hidden too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It seems that there's a bit of a power struggle going on, as the 
   General wants to impose his authority over everyone, but then John 
   Saxon, small, resourceful, aggressive, is the clear obvious leader. 
   Everyone is also a bit interested in Rossana Schiafinno (from the 
   boring <B><A HREF="silence_the_witness_1974.htm">SILENCE THE WITNESS</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="cagliostro_1975.htm">CAGLIOSTRO</A></B>, which I'm 
   going to have to watch because no one else will). She makes the 
   obvious choice by eventually going with Saxon, but that makes Nino a 
   bit jealous.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Although slow-going, we do get a sense of how much time these folks 
   spend underground, fruitlessly searching for a way out while trying 
   to stay civil. Hagman and the General try to keep their secret booze 
   stash secret, the German becomes friends with everyone, and Saxon 
   never gives up hope. If you are prepared to cut the film a little 
   slack in the first half, it pays off as you become more invested in 
   the characters in the second half, and the remarkable display of 
   patience they have with each other as they begin to freak out at 
   their situation.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Everyone gives one hundred percent here, from Saxon's hard case 
   soldier who still respects the General, even though he's gone nuts, 
   to Nino Castelnuovo (Carlo from <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StripNudeKiller">STRIP

    Some guy is driving about when he all of a sudden hits a badly 
   disguised ramp and crashes, which instantly sends his consciousness 
   into some alternate reality where he's Jesus. While his car is 
   screeching along the road on its roof, he's standing in an industrial 
   yard when a bunch of people turn up representing the various 
   authorities in modern day Italian life - The Church, The State, The 
   Police, The Military and...er...The Hookers. This lot drive up in a 
   bunch of cars and proceed to tie Jesus up and set him on fire. Back 
   in reality, his car burns away. I knew this one was going to be hard 
   to describe.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Later, in some unknown city, Jesus is wandering around when he finds 
   a woman who has been beaten up by some youths. Jesus helps her and is 
   taken home, where he tends to her wounds and she explains that she's 
   become a hooker due to being hooked on drugs. Then she sparks up a 
   pretty fat dooby and hallucinates all sorts of crap before getting in 
   on with Jesus in a scene that must have involved some hardcore bits 
   because it pretty much jumps through that fairly clunkily.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mind you, the whole film is pretty disjointed so who knows. Now, 
   D'Agostino cleary wears his influences on his shoulders because 
   there's a fairly large Fellini and Pasolini vibe about this whole 
   film, and never more so than in the huge brothel that hosts in the 
   form of guests all those authority figures, who are being serviced by 
   a topless Madam and her naked charges. Jesus watches while everyone's 
   attention is drawn to a huge foam mouth sitting in the middle of the 
   floor, from which emerges a blonde girl whom I'm guessing from the 
   plot keywords on the IMDb is a hermaphrodite. Then from what I can 
   gather the Madam invites everyone to either shit or piss on the floor 
   before Jesus goes nuts and loads of people get arrested. This would 
   also be known as 'that bit in a film where I wonder why I'm bothering 
   watching any further'.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Jesus is arrested with a bunch of left-wing revolutionaries and 
   while waiting in the corridor he hears the police beat a guy to death 
   and then try to cover it up, causing widespread riots. Jesus himself 
   cures a blind guy and gives him powers to heal others which leads to 
   more political upheaval, and the powers that be have to think of a 
   way to sort things out...perhaps by getting Jesus on their side? 
   Whatever happens, there's sure to be plenty of nudity.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Filmed nicely and with an <A HREF="ceremony_of_the_senses_1979.htm#OST">electronic
    soundtrack</A> that's by far the best thing about the film, <B>THE 
   CEREMONY OF THE SENSES</B> is a commentary of Italian life that's 
   been commented on in much better ways, and is seemingly heavily

    OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM</A></B> (still haven't watched it yet). It 
   also pretty much follows the twelve stations of the cross, with a 
   Last Supper scene consisting on the authority figures laughing for 
   seven minutes (!) while getting noshed on by naked slaves and Jesus 
   getting persecuted by the police. Of note, however, is a scene that 
   reflects the one in <B><A HREF="shining_1980.htm">THE SHINING</A></B>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This ridiculously good-looking film starts off with rich housewife 
   Silvia (Haydee Politoff from <B><A HREF="queens_of_evil_1970.htm">QUEENS
    OF EVIL</A></B>) seeing off her husband as he goes abroad to work 
   for a while, then she immediately goes to the villa owned by movie 
   star Margaret (Rosanna Schiaffino from Damiano Damiani&#146;s 
   interesting <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Witch1966">THE WITCH IN LOVE</A></B>).
    Silvia has been notified by her friend Dinah that her employer 
   Margaret needs a new slave to have around, and Silvia has volunteered 
   to do so.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The job comes with a decent wage, but Silvia has to put up with 
   Margaret being an obnoxious insufferable control freak the entire 
   time, which she does. Margaret (who we first meet taking part in a 
   cinematically amazing photo session) likes to lord it over all of her 
   staff, but for Silvia she&#146;s reserved a special pool of energy 
   devoted to humiliating and degrading her, and not in a filthy Jess 
   Franco film way. Maybe she should have gone down the Lina Romay 
   route, because Silvia seems to be prone to lapsing into fantasy where 
   she&#146;s being treated much worse.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As times goes on, Silvia becomes more embroiled in her world, 
   meeting Margaret&#146;s lovers &#150; mute butler Aldo Giuffre (the 
   drunk Captain from <B><A HREF="good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_1966.htm">THE
    GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY</A></B>), and fellow actor Gabrielle 
   Tinti (who could play this part in his sleep). She also discovers 
   that there are boundaries to her role as slave, and that if she 
   oversteps the mark, there are punishments to be doled out, which 
   leads to insights for Margaret, rather than Silvia.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film reminded me quite a lot of <B><A HREF="laughing_woman_1969.htm">THE
    LAUGHING WOMAN</A></B>, where Philipe Leroy torments Dagmar 
   Lassander in a villa full of kitschy modern art (including a huge

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>CHEERS TO CYANIDE</B> is truly Maryl&#146;s show all the way, as 
   she plays a character who superficially is your typical blonde 
   bombshell, but underneath is a highly cunning and intelligent person 
   running rings around everyone she encounters, while not being afraid 
   to flash those huge eyes to get her own way either.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The story involves Mara initially appearing to work for the cops as 
   an informant as she helps to link bank robber Brad Harris to some 
   crimes by obtaining his fingerprints, only for Harris to escape. She 
   then joins rival robber Gordon Mitchell&#146;s gang and pretty much 
   gets him arrested too for the theft of some very expensive diamonds, 
   but when Mitchell&#146;s bodyguard tries to kill her, she first 
   charms then poisons him with cyanide-laced champagne. This is a 
   light- hearted film mind you, so the murder is played up for laughs a 
   bit, like in real life.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mara then starts an uneasy alliance with Harris and some other guys 
   to steal back those diamonds, which are now stashed in a seemingly 
   impenetrable bank vault in France. It&#146;s the heist of these 
   diamonds that takes up a large chunk of the film, as the vault owner 
   explains the high-tech security system they have in place (infra-red 
   beams, scores of guards, coded vault door, no security cameras, 
   strangely), and then we watch Mara et al prepare and then overcome 
   these obstacles. I&#146;ll level with you here &#150; if you&#146;re 
   not a fan of Mara Maryl, this part is going to drag.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Luckily I am a fan, so I enjoyed Mara acting like a female James 
   Bond with all her gadgets and costumes, constantly thinking on her 
   feet, thinking around corners and turning on her charms. You have to

    I nearly forgot to mention she even gets to sing a song in a 
   nightclub too. Harris and Mitchell are good in support, and get 
   rewarded by having a Spaghetti Western style shootout at the end. The 
   light-hearted tone of the film thankfully doesn&#146;t collapse into 
   silliness either, so what you end up with is a decent love letter 
   from Gastaldi to Maryl.</FONT></FONT></P>

   familiar faces from the Sergio Leone films...</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">There's
    something not right about this film and I can't figure out what it 
   is. The cinematography is excellent. Ivan Rassimov makes a good hero, 
   with Mickey Hargitay backing him up as the mysterious gunfighter with 
   a secret. Piero Lulli does a good turn as the grinning evil bad guy, 
   and there's a huge gun battle at the end. Somehow, however, I wasn't impressed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Maybe it's because it's just so damn generic. Ivan Rassimov is 
   Cjamango, a cocky gunslinger who wins a shitload of money and gold in 
   a card game, only to have it immediately stolen from him when a gang 
   led by The Tiger (Lulli) and Don Pablo (the guy Lee Van Cleef shoots 
   through a pillow in <B><A HREF="good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_1966.htm">THE
    GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY</A></B>). They do this in the most 
   subtle way - they storm the saloon the card game is taking place in 
   and gun down everyone in it (watch the table falling on Rassimo when 
   he's shot - he seems to get a bit of a shock!). Not only do they not 
   pay local drunk Hernandez for tipping them off about the money, The 
   Tiger steals the lot and hides it out at his ranch, much to the rage 
   of Don Pablo.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Some unspecified time later, Cjamango returns, and wants his money 
   back. To do so, he'll have to watch&nbsp; <B><A HREF="fistful_of_dollars_1964.htm">A
    FISTFUL OF DOLLARS</A></B>, because this film generally follows that 
   plot, what with the two rival gangs and Cjamango proposing 
   allegiances and what not. I suppose Cjamango isn't so much of an 
   anti-hero, as he stops a woman from being raped and chums about with 
   some kid that's been ostracised because the dumbass villagers think a 
   scar he has it the plague.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The thing is, I couldn't have given a crap. The film looks great 
   (the HD version I watched was nice), but where's the quirkiness and 
   sleaze? It's like Sardinian director Edoardo Mulargia decided to play 
   things real safe and the result is one of the most straight down the 
   middle Spaghetti Westerns I've watched. It does have the gunfights 
   and what not, but the only notable scene was Lulli tying the kid up 
   with some dynamite and lighting the fuse in order to force Cjamango 
   to tell him where the gold was.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Maybe some folks prefer their Westerns this way - realistic and 
   grim, but I prefer mine slightly surreal or quirky, like Carlo 
   Lizzani's <B><A HREF="requiescant_1967.htm">REQUIESCANT</A></B> or <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    In the show's finale, which features Giuliano Gemma and William 
   Berger (who doesn't appear in <B>A SKY FULL OF STARS FOR A ROOF</B>), 
   a gunfight enues, but it seems that the loud gunfire has been used as 
   cover for someone to actually murder a member of the audience. A man 
   in the front row, who mysteriously entered the cinema ten minutes 
   before the climax of the film, has been shot in the heart. No one is 
   allowed to leave, and the police turn up to interview all fifty-three

   that barely any of them have names, so here we go...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's the shifty looking pair consisting of Tony Kendall and a 
   familiar face from Spaghetti Westerns who are eager to escape the 
   cinema, the awkward sociologist (Flavio Bucci from pervy kidnap film <B><A HREF="la_orca_1976.htm">LA
    ORCA</A></B> and <B><A HREF="#WorkingClass1971">LULU THE TOOL</A></B>),
    a shame-faced couple who are having an affair, a guy who likes 
   smoking (look- that's all I've got on him), a young couple, a feisty 
   granny and her chaperone, a mouthy gay guy and all the staff at the 
   cinema. The police descend on the place and start interviewing folks 
   while checking out the victim's background.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    They make progress on the guy's background at least. He was a keen 
   cinema goer and a retired civil servant who, according to his 
   landlady, led a sedentary life and just liked to watch television, 
   save for those times he liked to stand in front of a mirror and muse 
   over his image and how his reflection did in a way exist in some form 
   separately from himself. Actually, that doesn't sound like they made 
   any progress at all, but it's better than the avalanche of lies and 
   verbal abuse they get from the audience.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Luciano Catenacci turns up as a higher ranking cop determined to get 
   to the bottom of this by now irritating murder, as the media are 
   getting involved and a crowd are gathering outside. He sets up a 
   reconstruction of the first murder, but when a second person is 
   murdered, more questions are raised and the audience begin to freak 
   out, and not in a good sixties way. Man.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film heads off in a different direction in the climax, but it's 
   well foreshadowed by some clever dialogue. The audience, including 
   Tony Kendall, don't have much to do, so most of the investigations 
   are carried out by the cops and Flavio Bucci, who has some ideas of 
   his own. That sounds boring but it isn't, as there are so many quirky 
   characters in this film the plot just bounces along nicely in an 
   absurdist fashion, almost surreal in some places.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guess you can take it for what it is or look deeper to see if 
   there is any hidden meanings. I was going to write what my

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The killer wears sunglasses and dons white gloves to do his killing, 
   be it by knife, pipe or coke bottle. There's loads of POV shots and 
   for some reason he always leaves his own blood at the scene. He also 
   lives in a stinking hovel full of cockroaches he likes to pierce with 
   needles and the pictures of his victims stuck to the walls. We're led 
   to believe that his hidden identity may hint that one of the cast is 
   the killer, like a giallo, but that doesn't happen.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Neurotic cop Carter Wong (from <B><A HREF="big_trouble_in_little_china_1986.htm">BIG

   Le (the random Kung Fu guy from <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B>!)
    as his sidekick who also has his own sub plot on the go, featuring

   - watch that instead!). Carter's getting all worried that his boss is 
   bringing in a new cop to help because Carter's not very good at 
   catching serial killers, which Carter proves to the audience by 
   having one of his female officers pose as a hooker in order to lure 
   the killer in. You can imagine how that works out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In yet another sub-plot that made me think I was watching a Godfrey 
   Ho cut up, illegal immigrant Wei (possibly) is trying to grift in 
   order to make cash for his wife and baby, but his missus is getting 
   all up in his face about money, and instead goes off to sell her body 
   to a local rich guy. Mocked by the rich guy's goons, Wei goes nuts 
   and gets into a fight with both wife and goons, leading to the baby 
   being crushed by a chest of drawers (!). This part of the film 
   literally makes no sense until much later. It also leads to two of 
   the fakest mannequins you've ever seen being tossed from a balcony. 
   Then another one near the end of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Can Carter and Bruce find the killer without getting too many of 
   their own people killed? Can Bolo Yeung sport a rather fetching red 
   tracksuit while throwing a car on its side during a kung fu fight? 
   Can you stay awake for the last ten minutes of the film as the 
   filmmakers inexplicably try to fit in as many kung fu fights possible 
   in an effort to tie up the drug dealer plot the audience didn't care 
   about in the first place? Can Bruce Le handcuff a guy who's neck he'd 
   just broken just seconds before?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's on YouTube if you want it. There's plenty of violence but not 
   much gore (I'm also guessing some nudity was cut out the version I 
   watched), and although some Kung Fu films can seem never ending this 
   one went by quickly. The giallo elements are pretty fun to watch 
   (including spiral staircases, POV shots, stalking scenes, kid's toys, 
   etc., etc.) so that livened things up a bit.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The premise of the film doesn't sound very promising: a married 
   couple stay in a huge villa in Sicily. The husband (Tomas Milian) is 
   a writer struggling with an extremely bad case of writer's block, and 
   is considering writing for the local communist newspaper as they keep 
   harassing him to do so. His wife (Macha Meril, who if you saw her now 
   seems to have aged in Helen Mirren years) is even more bored than he 
   is, tending to a citrus grove which is their only source of income, 
   and being driven crazy by the terrible hired help. The only way out 
   seems to be the offer to buy the land by Milian's distant family...a 
   distant family who also happen to be Mafia property developers.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's doesn't sound that exciting, does it? And the tedium and 
   inertia of the couple in the villa is the plot's main focus, which is 
   carried out in a cyclical way. Milian gets a daily shave. Meril goes 
   to the shops. Milian meets the communists. Meril fights with the 
   staff. Meril and Milian eat dinner. The same thing happens the next 
   day. And the next, while in the background the Mafia employ cheap 
   tactics to try and get the land.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The thing is, all this is done in the strangest way possible, with 
   the quirkiest characters. The barber who cuts Milian's hair has a 
   very strange haircut himself, and is a lecherous womaniser. A 
   sub-plot develops on whether or not he rubbed his crotch on Meril's 
   shoulder while giving her a perm. The hired help don't like him, 
   calling him a thief, but then what we see them do is basically sponge 
   off of Meril and Milian. The help is basically a grubby father/son 
   team who steal Milian's booze and cigarettes. The son in particular 
   is bizarre. He permanently walks around with a blaring radio around 
   his neck and seems to have a fascination with throwing objects out of 
   windows. He's also a tuneless singer in a band and uses Meril's 
   clothes to clean his shoes. The Mafia presentative who now and again 
   appears to try and persuade Milian to sell the land talks like a 
   poet. There's even a scene where Meril greets a young child only to 
   be answered by &quot;I like your thighs. I would definitely do 
   you.&quot; And so it goes on.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film probably still wouldn't work if the two leads weren't up 
   for it. It's no surprise that Milian is up for being covered in 
   filth, screaming, and walking around naked, because that's pretty 
   much what he does, but Meril pretty much does the same thing! The 
   film literally starts with Milian eating a raw egg yolk (with half of 
   it dribbling down his chin), while Meril licks artichoke juice from 
   his chest. Turns out these bizarre meals are part of the cycle too - 
   at one point Meril scoops out a fishes eyeball and eats it, just 
   before the hired help takes the rest of the fish away and dumps it in 
   a pond. The next meal consists of a huge plate of soft shell crabs 
   with raw, giant onions and random tinned stuff. The fact that these 
   two act like everything that's going on around is not only normal, 
   but boring, won me over.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm still leaving plenty of stuff out of the review to discover for 
   yourself. Fans of Milian should definitely track this down. This and <B><A HREF="year_of_the_cannibals_1970.htm">THE

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A sweet old lady is woken up one night by an alarm going off in a 
   neighbour's house, but when she investigates she finds the young lady 
   living there dead, having slashed her wrists. Even more nasty is the 
   discovery of the woman's son, seemingly smothered to death in his bed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A young detective is brought in on the case, along with his sidekick 
   dog Smok, who is going to get rather heavily involved in proceedings, 
   poor thing. The detective discovers via the neighbour that this young 
   lady had a married lover who would visit, and therefore tracks the 
   guy down. However, this is where things start getting weird for the 
   cop. The guy, who has a solid alibi, tries to get the cop to drop the 
   case, but then reluctantly reveals that the girl was hounded into 
   killing herself by her father, who used to visit her every night. 
   That sounds like strange behaviour for a father, and even stranger 
   behaviour for one who has been dead for twelve years. Before the cop 
   can ask this guy if he's talking out of his arse or what, the guy 
   also kills himself.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the funeral of the dead girl and her son, the cop bumps into her 
   much sexier sister, who also has a small child. At first, there's no 
   talk of ghosts or suicide or such, but I guess that the rules of 
   attraction mean that after a good meal it's usually the appropriate 
   time to reveal to a potential lover that the ghost of your dead 
   father is stalking you and wants to take you and your child into the 
   afterlife for some vague reason. Rather than making his excuses and 
   running for the hills, the cop instead decides to stick in there. 
   After all, the ghosts did predict that the woman and the cop would 
   marry in a week (don't ask).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first half of the film is pretty sinister but kind of drags a 
   bit. However, when the ghost dad starts trying to get proactive in 
   expanding his post-mortal family, things get downright creepy. The 
   young child gets very, very sick, and the cop knows that if she dies, 
   her mother will kill herself, and then there'll be no more 
   hanky-panky for the cop. If only he could find a way to communicate 
   with the paterfamilias? When he does, it'll catch you off guard.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Without revealing much more plot things get stranger and spookier as 
   that damn ghost dad (and possibly others?) are hanging around the 
   place ruining the cop's sex life and getting on his tits with the 
   anger and the threats and such like. Even the dog gets involved,

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Well,
    this is where it all starts. The franchise for which both Tomas 
   Milian and Massimo Vanni are most famous. This is Tomas Milian as 
   quirky cop Inspector Giraldi, a strangely-dressed, dirty-looking 
   freak who keeps a mouse called Serpico and likes to get the bad guys 
   in less violent fashion than his contemporaries (even those played by 
   Milian himself).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film was a huge success in Italy, mainly due I guess to Milian's 
   off the wall performance as Giraldi, a crook turned cop who is always 
   trying to track down a bad guy called the Baron, plus some other guy 
   who keeps leaving message consisting of nothing but 'Up Yours!' on 
   Giraldi's answer machine. Things are played out lightly enough until 
   the Baron accidentally steals five million dollars from a hard case 
   gangster (Palance) and starts getting his mates killed while the 
   Mafia try and get their money back.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This doesn't stop Milian getting it on with the strangely patient 
   Maria Rosaria Ommagio (who looks like Kate Bush), a robbery victim 
   who doesn't seem to mind going to bed with Milian even though he 
   wears two pairs of socks, three jumpers and some nifty red budgie 
   smugglers, because of course no Milian film is complete without him 
   at least appearing once in his underwear. He also takes her disco 
   dancing which made me burst out laughing at Milian's moves, as well 
   as his get-up and the hat he wears that has &quot;Tomas Milian&quot;

    and I've no doubt that although it was a popular series in Italy, 
   surely the audiences were getting tired of this stuff by 1984. Don't 
   get excited by the title either - Tomas Milian does not cross-dress 
   in this film, so there's another fantasy that's never going to become 
   reality for us. Er, you, I mean.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This time around the flimsy premise that's going to serve as a 
   backdrop to all the japes is the murder of a drag queen at a club 
   called Blue Gay in Rome, but Inspector Giraldi has to turn down the 
   job due to his wife giving birth to their second child, and although 
   Milian does attempt to participate in looking after the baby, the 
   incessant screaming of the kid and his wife drive him to take on the 
   case, and to pretend to his wife that's he gone to New York, even 
   though he's still in Rome. You can tell where that one's heading 
   right away, as there's always a bit of marital strife in these films.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Milian suspects a rival drag queen is guilty of the murder, and 
   plans on infiltrating the trans scene by pretending he's gay, with a 
   transgender partner. For this he cajoles thief Bombolo into donning a 
   dress (with much slapping, their signature move) and the two head off 
   for the club. The drag queen, who performs as Colomba Lamarr, is 
   rather quite taken by Milian, but if they are prime suspect in all 
   this, who is the shifty looking guy following them around? And why is 
   he trying to listen in on their conversations? And what has it all to 
   do with those German fellows that are hanging around?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I have to point out that plot isn't a strong point in these films. 
   They just drop Milian (and Bombolo) into a stupid situation and milk 
   some jokes out of it, have a couple of scenes where Milian proves 
   irresistible to women (and trans folk in this one), and throw in a 
   couple of scenes of him mouthing off to his superiors. A couple of 
   action scenes, and the jobs a good 'un. Except there's barely any 
   action scenes in this one - just Milian catching a homophobic drug 
   dealer, a slight punch up, and Milian chasing a guy in a car while 
   driving a horse-drawn chariot and dressed like a Centurion. There 
   are, however, five dance sequences in this film, one of them to a 
   sped-up version of a song from Bugsy Malone.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The mystery of the killer isn't very exciting either, so the other 
   question is - is it funny? Well, not really. There's a couple of 
   moments with Bombolo that are okay, but mostly it's slapstick and 
   screaming, with Milian slapping Bombolo over and over again. I even 
   read that this was so much of a running gag that Milian even slapped 
   Bombolo's coffin at his funeral. I'm not making that up.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So in short, it's garbage, and Tomas Milian was deported from Italy 
   shortly afterwards due to this film (I'm making that bit up), where 
   he returned to America and wore a hat forever more because no one 
   would guess that he had started going bald in the late seventies.</FONT></FONT></P>

    This film alternates between Gemma's rise to power and his

   isn't given much to do in this film until the last scene, so I was

   standing in the background while Gemma takes centre stage. He is 
   quite good though, going from youthful arrogance to cold, calculating

   (which was made later). A young buck proves his ruthlessness, takes

   doubt Brian De Palma has seen this film though. It was hard enough to 
   find in an age where nearly every album or film is available for free 
   if you can be arsed typing in the title. It was worth tracking down 
   though. The opening murder by Gemma is a bit of a shock, and there's 
   moments like that dotted all over the film. It doesn't quite build up

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Let's
    talk quietly, me and you. In 2021, a film starring a guy pretending 
   to be Chinese isn't going to be especially popular, and quite rightly 
   so. I mean, Tomas Milian is basically reprising his role from Bruno 
   Corbucci's brother Sergio's film <B><A HREF="shoot_first_ask_questions_later_1975.htm">THE
    WHITE, THE YELLOW AND THE BLACK</A></B>, and by referring to himself 
   as the 'mongoloid' (because, you know, Mongolia) and starting every 
   sentence with 'awww...', I'm sure he's not respectively paying homage 
   to Chinese culture (although in the Sergio film he did manage to 
   display a certain humanity as the Japanese Sakura). What I'm trying 
   to say is: if I showed my daughter this film she'd kick my ass, but I 
   found it funny in parts, so who am I to hate on folks who like Peter 
   Sellers in <B><A HREF="party_1968.htm">THE PARTY</A></B>? To cut a 
   long story short, Milian is dead, so is Bombolo, and Corbucci, so 
   what are we going to do - exhume their corpses and kick utter fuck 
   out of their skeletons or just watch a film from a different era (40 
   years ago) and dig the moustache and huge eighties spectacles Massimo 
   Vanni is sporting.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's an inspector Giraldi film anyway, so the plot is just an excuse 
   for Milian to ham it up as Giraldi, who this time around has a broken 
   leg and has taken a vow not to lapse into his usual sarcastic 
   swearing ways (which I have found out there's a word for - 
   'turpiloquio'). He's also building an illegal house in the country 
   because this is some sort of loophole if you build it before you are 
   caught. Who knows. The main thing is - Milian is also playing a 
   Chinese guy. Now, I had to muddle through this film in Italian, but I 
   think Milian's Chinese guy is supposed to be a co-owner of a Chinese 
   restaurant right across from the Trevi Fountain, and he gets caught 
   up in a murder when one of the customers is found dead of arsenic poisoning.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The key to all this is Bombolo, who this time is called...Bombolo. 
   He's currently working loads of different jobs, working as a 
   chauffer, a cook in the Chinese restaurant, and helping Giraldi build 
   his house. Plus, he gets a slap in the face every time he swears due 
   to Giraldi's vow. When Bombolo and Ciu Ci Ciao (Milian's Chinese 
   character) discover the body, they decide to take the cadaver home as 
   a dead guy in a restaurant would destroy it's reputation. This leads 
   to some actually funny scenes as Bombolo tries to drag the body up a 
   flight of stairs. In fact, the main key to the funny bits of this 
   film is because the funny bits most resemble the Three Stooges and 
   their antics.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giraldi becomes involved in the investigation and quickly deduces 
   that Bombolo is involved somehow, but decides to keep his 
   investigations hidden from his superiors (one of which gets an 
   impromptu acupuncture session from Cio Ci Ciao). He deduces that a 
   clue might be held by the photographer hired by the restaurant to 
   make a bit of extra cash (and the photographer makes a bit of cash 
   himself from blackmail). This leads to a car chase through a factory 
   full of explosion chemicals where the photographer gets accidentally 
   frozen and his body starts sliding around the floor and bouncing off 
   of things, ending in Milian riding the body around and slapping the 
   crap out of an obvious dummy. It worked for me.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I did get some genuine laughs from this one, but I also like Adam 
   Sandler films so you might want to tread carefully here. Apart from 
   the car chase, there's maybe a lack of action that balanced out the 
   earlier Giraldi films, but at least it hasn't lapsed into the 
   'going-through-the-motions' of the last Giraldi film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   director seems to realise this and throws in a couple of random nudie 
   bits to keep you awake, from the 'here, let me rub sun cream on your 
   chest' bit, to the totally random orgy that the police raid that has 
   nothing to do with the plot. That will keep you going until the 
   suspects start turning up dead.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    No slashing here, but a few people still get whacked. There's also a

    This time around, as you can tell by the title, a top racing car 
   driver crashes during a race and dies, and it's quickly discovered 
   that the car had been sabotaged beforehand. As usual, car 
   thief-turned cop Tomas Milian is given the case, along with faithful 
   but not very bright sidekick Massimo Vanni. As you may know, Milian's 
   domestic life always features prominently in these films. In this 
   film he's got a troublesome brother-in-law who also likes to take 
   vehicles without the owners consent. There's also the omnipresent 
   Bombolo who Milian keeps catching trying to cause crimes, be it a 
   bank note scam or being the getaway driver in a robbery. It turns out 
   that Milian actually keeps a book of how many times he's slapped 
   Bombolo - is it 3,674 or 3,640?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Milian's son Rocky also features, and he's got a serious <B><A HREF="smurfs_2011.htm">SMURF</A></B> 
   obsession going on. As a person who grew up in the Eighties, I've got 
   to say I hated those fucking things. We also get a reference to 
   post-apocalyptic cinema when Milian's wife insists on wearing a 
   post-nuke fashion wear to the policeman's ball, and if you're all for 
   films from the Eighties referencing things that happened in the 
   Eighties, wait to you get to the <B><A HREF="flashdance_1983.htm">FLASHDANCE</A></B> 
   sequence in this film!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm getting ahead of myself though. First, Milian has to discover 
   that the Engineer in charge of the pit team at the race track has got 
   a really hot wife in the form of Dagmar Lassander. They both insist 
   that the dead driver was a great guy they loved like a son but there 
   was a rival team out there who hated him. It seems that he's going to 
   have to dig into the driver's past to find clues, but then something 
   monumentally stupid happens that you shouldn't think about too much 
   because the odds of it happening are astronomical.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After getting his brother-in-law out of a bad situation in a pool 
   hall with some nifty skills, he drops the guy off outside of his 
   apartment. Totally ignoring Milian's advice to stay on the straight 
   and narrow, he steals a white Mercedes and drives it to his nearest 
   fence. The guy freaks when he finds a corpse in the boot, and the 
   brother-in-law drives the car with the corpse in it to Milian's house 
   and begs for help, which, stupidly, Milian does. He goes to his 
   precinct and claims he found the car like that, prompting a 
   magistrate to investigate Milians past. Also, this corpse is linked 
   to the death of the racing car driver, but as I said, don't ponder 
   how much of a coincidence that is.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Although it gets a bit talky in the middle, <B>CRIME IN FORMULA ONE</B> 
   does manage to keep the balance of comedy, drama, and action just 
   about right, with a giallo plot that Milian actually refers to as 
   such in the dialogue. You have Milian doing the usual slapping 
   Bombolo and insulting Massimo Vanni (who literally obeys any order 
   he's given, even if it's pressing every switch in Milian's house to 
   see if there's a bomb attached). You have drama in the form of Milian 
   getting suspended due to his past, which he plays straight, and you 
   also get Milian foiling a robbery and a fairly decent chase sequence 
   involving two racing cars at the end of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The most prominent scene in the film however is when Milian (or a 
   guy pretending to be him) does an energetic dance sequence like the 
   film <B>FLASHDANCE</B> (disclaimer: I'm guessing as I've never seen 
   it). He goes to a dance class to interrogate an ex-girlfriend of the 
   dead driver, but when challenged about why he's there, he breaks into 
   a lengthy, slow-motion dance that goes on for some time.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    read one review of this film, and in that review it states that this 
   is known as one of the worst of the gialli. Sure, it's really low 
   budget, the Guido and Maurizio De Angelis soundtrack swings insanely 
   from good to full fat cheese, the acting is randomly bad and the 
   giant cast confuses the plot, but I'll be damned if I wasn't 
   entertained. Who wouldn't be entertained by dwarf punch-ups, rampant 
   nudity, and a killer who injects his victims with a venom that turns 
   the victim's head into what looks like a giant foam mushroom?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It all starts with one of those rich people orgies where all those 
   rich people flock to a huge villa in Italy and get wasted on drugs 
   then have group sex before one of them is found dead with a face like 
   a ball of playdough that's had all the colours mixed in. This dead 
   person is Harry, a wild guy who has all sorts of lovers, and his 
   death has sparked a huge wave of panic among those who attended the 
   party, those who supplied the drugs for the party, and just about 
   everyone else associated with Harry. There's a murderer out there, 
   and everyone involved is overdue a venom injection!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    On the case is an inspector whose daughter is concurrently reading a 
   giallo with a very similar plot to the movie, and a journalist who 
   wrote the giallo that the inspector's daughter is reading. How's that 
   for meta, Wes Craven? These two, with the aid of ill-looking police 
   chief George Ardisson, set out to find the killer among the several 
   hundred potential victims we have to confusingly sift through 
   throughout the film. There's relations of Harry, lovers of Harry, 
   drug dealers of Harry, and addicts of drug dealers of Harry all 
   getting involved in this thing. Most end up injected with venom and 
   having their face turn into a rubbery looking mess with an eyeball 
   poking out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I did get the feeling that this film isn't exactly meant to be 
   taking seriously, as quite a lot of the film is less interested in 
   the plot and more interested in actress Michela Miti, who plays the 
   girlfriend of the guy who lent his villa to Harry in order for him to 
   have his orgy (this film is exhausting in that respect). Michela gets 
   to do a ridiculous seduction routine with villa owner William (whom I 
   swear turns to the camera and rolls his eyes, but can't confirm due 
   to the terrible print). She also takes part in a sexy photo shoot and 
   more sex scenes before getting turned into a foam horror. There's 
   also the police inspector having a punch up with a dwarf, and one 
   character being terrified out of her mind by being stalked by a 
   killer, only for it to turn out to be a random guy who discards his 
   disguise in order to perform a weird dance, and then run off!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    this didn't quite work. <B>CRIMES AND PERFUMES</B> has been sitting 
   in my 'to-watch' list for years, and I can't say it was worth the 
   wait. Sometimes the giallo and comedy elements do gel, like in <B><A HREF="#Cat1977">THE
    CAT</A></B>, but when a woman is on fire and screaming and a guy is 
   doing slapstick while struggling with a fire extinguisher, I'm not 
   sure what to think.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Frustratingly, the premise of this could have resulted in an awesome 
   late Eighties giallo that overdoes on the fashions and music of the 
   era, just like <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#TooBeautifulDie1988">TOO 
   BEAUTIFUL TO DIE</A></B> and <B><A HREF="nothing_underneath_1985.htm">NOTHING
    UNDERNEATH</A></B>. Someone is murdering women by giving them a 
   perfume that catches fire in halogen light, burning them to death. 
   The film also relies on giallo cliches like childhood trauma and 
   clues in photographs, and a normal guy trying to unearth the mystery.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But...it's a very broad comedy too. I realise this film was probably 
   just a vehicle for comedian Jerry Cala, and maybe fans of him will 
   like it, but sad giallo fans like me who tick these films off some 
   list like a birdwatcher catching a glimpse of a rare bird will be let 
   down, and in the end, is that not the true tragedy of the film? Does 
   director Vittorio De Sisti lie awake at night, pondering how die hard 
   giallo fans emerge from their dank unaired hovels into the blinking 
   sunlight, depressed as they have wasted yet another hour and a half 
   watching a load of crap? The answer is no...he died in 2006. Eva 
   Grimaldi fans will also be let down as she appears for about five 
   minutes, does a provocative dance, and goes up in flames.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm waffling because I can't even look the plot in the face. Jerry 
   Cala plays Eddy, a security guard working in a shopping mall whose 
   most exciting outing is tracking down the black-gloved arse pincher 
   haunting the stores. He works alongside Barbara, his fiance, who has 
   just been given a bottle of perfume by a mysterious stranger. A 
   couple of minutes later Barbara is a pile of ash in a corridor, and a 
   bumbling policeman is on the case, who strangely kind of resembles 
   Matt Berry from <B><A HREF="garth_marenghis_darkplace_2004.htm">GARTH 
   MARENGHI'S DARKPLACE</A></B>. This guy's just here to chase Eddy 
   about, thinking he's the murderer, but the real investigation is 
   undertaken by Eddy, and his sidekick Yoko, played by the very pretty 
   Nina Soldano (from <B><A HREF="night_of_the_sharks_1988.htm">NIGHT OF 
   THE SHARKS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#FatalFrames1996">FATAL
    FRAMES</A></B>). Not that you'd be able to tell that from the 
   version I watched, which was more like a 123rd generation porn VHS 
   that's been handed around a high school for years and had the tape 
   churned up by a teenager hurriedly trying to remove the tape from the 
   machine as they've just spotted their parents entering the front 
   gate. My brother broke our dad's VHS in this exact manner, getting a 
   porno stuck inside it in a mad panic and destroying the VHS player in 
   the process.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Look, it takes FIFTY minutes for Eddy to figure out that it's the 
   perfume that's the killer's method of murder, so that doesn't leave 
   much time for anything else to happen, save for Eddy pretending to be 
   a priest for ages in order to get a clue or two about the murders. I 
   suppose he uses a cheeseball Eighties computer method to figure out 
   the victims, and there's a chase scene at the end that seems to come 
   from a different film in its tone. This film is all over the place.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">I'll
    begin with saying that this is some sort of spin-off of a French TV 
   series but I had trouble finding information on that during the whole 
   five minutes I was Googling the title. Also, for those who aren't 
   death metal fans, Belphegor is one of the Devil's henchman in Hell, 
   along with Baal, Astaroth, Asmodeus and Michael Jackson. He's 
   supposed to tempt people into selling their souls by offering them 
   strange inventions, which is maybe why the killer in this film uses 
   so much gadgetry.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In France, somewhere, a dance troupe are putting together a gig 
   about said demon, using hilariously bad dance routines that end in a 
   pretend human sacrifice. The guys behind the troop - the theatre 
   owner, an extremely over-the-top gay guy who reminded me of Mr 
   Humphries from <B><A HREF="are_you_being_served_tv_series_1972-1985.htm">ARE
    YOU BEING SERVED?</A></B>, a floor manager, and some other guys, are 
   just getting over the death of one of the stage hands, but they are 
   not sweating it too much - shit happens. What they don't know is the 
   guy died after being startled by some freaky dude wearing a Belphegor 
   mask who is going to be putting the hurts on everyone very shortly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While pondering whether or not the huge Belphegor statue they have 
   is too big, the damn thing starts speaking. The voice of Belphegor 
   tells them all that he doesn't like his name being besmirched (no 
   wonder - the dancing is shit!) and now everyone involved is going to 
   die. He even lists what order they will die in, and the theatre owner 
   is first up for a killing. Strangely, instead of brushing it off, 
   these folk do actually call the police in, but they are unable to 
   find any speakers on the statue, or even the many cameras Belphegor 
   seems to own, seeing as he's able to watch every thing that happens 
   in the film on a giant screen in his hideout.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first kill actually sets a sinister tone that isn't followed 
   through, as Belphegor stalks and traps the theatre owner in the 
   theatre before stabbing him in the guts and leaving him on the fake 
   altar. It's quite atmospheric, so it's shame the film descends 
   immediately into a lot of unfunny comedy scenes and the cast acting 
   like a guy didn't just get murdered the day before. In fact, they go 
   out to dinner to celebrate the young hero guy inheriting the theatre! 
   There's also far too much comedy from the janitor of the theatre 
   (Achille Zavatta, a real life clown) who gets drunk a lot and has 
   some slapstick antics with the plot's red herring.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And that's basically how the film runs until the end. Belphegor 
   kills someone (including shooting a poison dart from his eye!), the 
   police turn up, the young guy and his plucky female journalist friend 
   do a bit of investigation, and the old janitor or the gay guy provide 
   the laughs. The shifts in tone reminded me a lot of <B><A HREF="it_chapter_two_2019.htm">IT:

    and it sure as hell didn't work in that one. You do get to find out 
   who the killer is in the end, but believe me, you won't care.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The weird mix of giallo, comedy, sixties grooviness, spy film 
   gadgets and horror does not work at all, and it doesn't help that the 
   hero looks like what you'd get if Davey Jones of the Monkees and 
   Herve Villechaize had a baby. We have a beggar kicking around in the 
   street outside my office who looks exactly like Herve, by the way, 
   only female and with a rather shrill Glaswegian accent. I guess <B>THE

   fucking watch it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   all the paparazzi there due to him being only a bystander. It's 
   during his rehabilitation at a local gym where his life takes a real 
   turn. He's just about to get his arse kicked by a bunch of guys 
   practising karate when hunky cop Vittorio Mezzogiorno steps in to 
   help him, kicking off a fairly intimate bromance! If you aren't 
   comfortable standing naked in front of a likewise naked guy and 
   discussing the last scene of <B><A HREF="for_a_few_dollars_more_1965.htm">FOR
    A FEW DOLLARS MORE</A></B>, that man isn't your true friend. Unless 
   I misunderstood that bit and all Italians discuss Sergio Leone films 
   totally naked.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Nino And Vittorio go jogging together, have lunch together, and have 
   dinner at Nino's house (where it looks like Vittorio and Nino's wife 
   might just be a little attracted to each other). Nino discovers he 
   has a hidden talent when Vittorio takes him to a shooting range and 
   Nino turns out to be a natural. He also becomes completely obsessed 
   by guns, taking his fascination to the same level as that of his 
   watch repair hobby, and totally doing his wife's head in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A chance meeting between Vittorio and a wanted man takes the film in 
   a much darker direction than the pretty lightweight first half, where 
   Nino's deadly accurate shooting skills make him somewhat of a 
   celebrity, but then violence breeds violence, and Nino finds himself 
   in a world that starts getting harder and harder to escape from, and 
   relying more and more on the power he feels when holding a gun, much 
   to the detriment of those around him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I knew next to nothing about the film before I watched it, the title 
   being something I added to my never-ending watch list a couple of 
   years ago, and I swear when it started I thought it was supposed to 
   be a kind of light comedy. Nino Manfredi seems to feature in a lot of 
   comedies (save for <B><A HREF="girolimoni_the_monster_of_rome_1972.htm">GIROLIMONI,
    THE MONSTER OF ROME</A></B>, which is also on my to-watch list), and 
   this goes in his favour here as he's kind of goofy and timid at 
   first, preferring to take a step back from things and be a bystander, 
   including those fiery arguments between his boss and his rebellious 
   daughter. However, when he realises the power in being able to wield 
   a gun, he changes, becomes brave and bold...and reckless. Hats off to 
   Marlene Jobert who plays his wife too - they bounce off each other 
   quite well.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Look out for Olga Karlatos as the wife of Nino's boss. I swear that 
   lady looks different in every single film I've seen her in. Luciano 
   Catenucci turns up as the guy hired to take over the dangerous 
   cash-runs, and Mario Brega (from <B><A HREF="angel_for_satan_1966.htm">AN
    ANGEL FOR SATAN</A></B>) appears as a bad guy who becomes Nino's 
   nemesis. This film isn't all about action however, although there are 
   a couple of shoot-outs. Vittorio warns Nino that a gun is not a toy, 
   and the film is more about Nino not taking that advice seriously.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    One last note about <A HREF="dangerous_toy_1979.htm#OST">Ennio 
   Morricone's soundtrack</A>. I love the guy's work, but I do notice 
   that when called on to compose Eurocrime music, he tends to use the

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">It's
    going to be hard to write a review about a film that consists mostly 
   of Jean Seberg wandering around an apartment in Morocco, but let's 
   give it a go.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jean Seberg is a frustrated, bored, and anxious wife of an 
   architect, languishing in an apartment in Morocco. We get to witness 
   such thrills as Jean trying to get the air conditioning to work, 
   knocking some ceramic statues around in a bored fashion, drinking 
   some cold water, watching paint dry, staring at her toes, and 
   annoying the hired help.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Hang on to the edge of your seat as Jean listens to recording of her 
   husband and tries to call her doctor, Luigi Pistilli, then has a 
   shower and stands at a window as towel falls off. Then she completes 
   a crossword and fills in some outstanding tax invoices before seeing 
   how long she can stand watching Channel 4 racing. Pulses race as Jean 
   walks into the kitchen but then can't remember why she went in there 
   in the first place, so instead she spends two hours scraping dried 
   cereal from a kitchen counter.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot thickens as Jean alphabetizes her compact disc collection, 
   then decides that perhaps chronological order might be better before 
   things take a turn for the exciting when we have a chase sequence 
   where Jean chases a fly around the house with a rolled up copy of a 
   newspaper, ending with the gory murder of the fly up against a 
   window. Then Jean sits watching cringe videos on YouTube for six 
   hours while stuffing Pringles into her mouth.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gasp as Jean finally goes outside, only to drive aimlessly around 
   trying to find her doctor, getting annoyed by the locals, then 
   getting annoyed by the non-locals who languish themselves in a 
   private country club. Then faint in shock as Jean returns to her home 
   and starts staring at people again before dramatically finally 
   getting in touch with her doctor.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jean Seberg fans will have a field day with this one as the film is 
   nearly a one person show. Giallo fans may not have such a good time 
   because the mystery of 'Where is Jean's husband?' is easy to solve. 
   The film looks good and is definitely leaning towards arthouse, but 
   maybe too chilled for its own good.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jean Seberg's real life makes for particularly grim reading. 
   Possibly hounded by the FBI to the point she can't stand the anxiety 
   and kills herself?</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Wow.
    What sounded good on paper absolutely didn't work onscreen. I was 
   expecting a high octane, low budget action film where two guys 
   protect a psychic lady from shadowy government agencies, but what I 
   got instead was a little bit of that with a shitload of Robin 
   Askwith-style sex comedy mixed in for good measure. To make things 
   even worse, there's a huge generic Eurospy vibe about it all too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    English Vietnam veteran (?) Kowalski has made his way to Greece to 
   meet his friend Ches and bum about the Med for a bit. He does this by 
   stealing a ticket off a guy in England, locking him in a toilet, and 
   stealing his identity. Once in Greece, Kowalski meets his mate at the 
   airport and uses his stolen identity to blag a limo and scam a meal 
   from the hotel he's staying at by giving the waiter the wrong room 
   number. Strangely, the two women sitting next to him seen to know 
   he's faking it, and it doesn't help that Kowalski's charging a meal 
   to their hotel room. The younger of the women, Christina, reveals 
   Kowalski's real name and freaks the guy out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Not that it stops Kowalski getting it on with his mates girlfriend, 
   who seemingly wanders around Ches's houses with only an apron on. It 
   also must be an open relationship too, because she jumps into bed 
   with Kowalski straight away, then, both Kowalski and Ches while a 
   parrot makes disparaging remarks. This was the seventies - I bet they 
   all reeked. Turns out that Ches had scammed his way into the house of 
   an older lover and she returns to find them all in bed together, 
   throwing everyone including the parrot out into the street. It's at 
   this point Christina calls, tells Kowalski she knows he's homeless 
   and that she has a job for him and Ches.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Christina's mother Geraldine explains, she and Christina have 
   been on the run from Germany and need Kowalski's protection from 
   strange people who have been following her (including rather a lot of 
   guys on motorbikes). For me things start to get a bit hazy around 
   this point of the film because Kowalski and Ches seem to make things 
   a lot worse for everyone, and Christina doesn't seem to need any 
   protecting at all, because she can use her powers to blow shit up and 
   make people kill themselves.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So on one hand you have what would have made a kind of enjoyable 
   sci-fi caper with government bad guys getting whacked left right and 
   centre, but in this film the action always grinds to a halt so that 
   either Ches or Kowalski get it on with some lady in a light-hearted, 
   comedy manner. The only bit where this actually works is when 
   Christina remotely gives Kowalski the 'brewer's droop' when he's 
   about to get it on with a sexy racing car lady he randomly meets.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm a big fan of Niko Mastorakis (especially <B><A HREF="nightmare_at_noon_1987.htm">NIGHTMARE
    AT NOON</A></B>, <B><A HREF="island_of_death_1975.htm">ISLAND OF DEATH</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="hired_to_kill_1990.htm">HIRED TO KILL</A></B>), but 
   his debut film is a bit rubbish to be honest. There's plenty of 
   nudity and a couple of scenes of Christina using her powers that's 
   pretty good, but choppy editing, bi-polar tone, and lead characters I 
   hated instantly just put me off.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I did however get a huge '<B><A HREF="firestarter_1984.htm">FIRESTARTER</A></B>'

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Proper
    sleazy giallo here featuring some very hairy men indeed. In Greece, 
   former drug-smuggler and disgraced ship's Captain, Captain Jim, isn't 
   happy enough with the yacht his millionaire wife bought him for his 
   birthday (the ship is also called Captain Jim, by the way). No, he 
   wants the lot - the money and the house, so he can go hang around 
   with what I believe the youth of today refer to as his 'side-bitch'. 
   This girl looks a lot like Agnetha from Abba, which is fitting 
   because Captain Jim looks a bit like Benny from Abba.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jim is also remarkably and hypocritically jealous of his wife's 
   former lover, a doctor who didn't like Jim's vibe but somehow didn't 
   manage to stop Jim muscling in on the millionairess. In one of many 
   unintentionally funny scenes in this film, Jim stands out on a 
   balcony to smoke a ciggy and spots his lover hanging around outside 
   in a car. He goes to meet her, just as the doctor emerges on another 
   balcony to puff on a sneaky ciggy of his own spotting Jim and getting 
   all suspicious and stuff.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jim's plan is simple: there's a serial killer scaring the crap out 
   of everyone by stalking lover's lanes, shooting the guy lover in the 
   head, then dragging the woman out onto the dirt to ravish and slap 
   around and finally strangle. There's a lot of slapping in this film, 
   by the way. It happens that the killer (who is an undertaker) and Jim 
   know each other, something which the film actually takes time out to 
   give an explanation for. Jim and his wife will go to one of the 
   killer's stalking grounds, he'll rough up Jim, and before you know it 
   Jim's down one wife and up a seven figure fortune.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The killer's plan, however, isn't simple. I won't go into it in 
   great detail, but he doesn't trust Jim and is about three steps ahead 
   of him in setting up a very convoluted plot where he keeps various 
   other woman drugged up in his home and goes looking for a woman who 
   looks exactly like Jim's wife. He's also lucky to get away with an 
   awful lot of stuff out on open roads without any passers-by but let's 
   not analyse how stupid parts of this film are.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The pace for this one is pretty quick and although the actor playing 
   the killer is kind of goofy, he's pretty entertaining, too. The whole 
   film is filled with nudity. And slapping, loads of slapping. I've 
   read comments saying that the soundtrack isn't that good but I found 
   it fine, and very Greek. Culturally there's a bit of folk dancing but 
   I'm sure a disclaimer in Greek said there were no plates harmed in 
   the making of this film.</FONT></FONT></P>

   soldiers sneaking into Nazi territory to perform an assassination. 
   However, what if we had a group of Germans trying to invade allied

    Lenzi exclaimed, &quot;I'll make this film, then a series of old

    Edwige Fenech completists only, and that's only if you can manage to

   a Minecraft-looking blurry mess with Greek subtitles.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>DESERT OF FIRE</B> is kind of like a Western set in the Saharan 
   desert, with good guys and bad guys and a hidden treasure and all 
   that stuff, but it's a film that never really goes anywhere. There's 
   no energy to proceedings and things just kind of happen, then things 
   slow down a bit, then there's a little action and repeat.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What it involves is Chinese actor George Wang playing an Arab who 
   robs a jeep full of wages so he can use the money to track down the 
   hidden treasure of Sharif...something or other (I've forgotten 
   already). Wang kills everyone travelling in the jeep, then all his 
   sidekicks, but while he's being smug, someone steals the cash and 
   flashes bright light into his eyes. Firing blindly, Wang thinks that 
   the spirit of Sharif has come back to haunt him, and runs away to the 
   nearest town to very badly lie that the jeep was ambushed by someone 
   who wasn't him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the town, lost English ex-Patriot St John dreams of returning 
   home to England, but also needs to locate Sharif's treasure. Rather 
   handily, he's married to Sharif's daughter, and his own daughter is 
   played by Edwige Fenech, a girl also seeking to escape the desert by 
   procuring money, even through any, naked means. At first she attempts 
   to seduce Wang, but when he reveals he hasn't got the stolen cash and 
   tries to rape her, Fenech seeks other less traumatising avenues, like 
   hooking up with the mysterious Ben (or Bill? Man, this film is forgettable).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ben/Bill has the cash and wants to use it for the greater good, but 
   he faces the wrath of Wang, the wrath of Fenech's mother, and the 
   machiniations of Fenech's dad. That rather small pool of character 
   means there's isnt going to be much by way of action in this one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In fact, apart from a couple of lame gun battles and an explosion, 
   most of the action comes from Wang shooting at people through a scope 
   (or while standing on a moving horse, so kudos to the stuntman who 
   did that bit), so it's not so much a desert of fire as a desert of a 
   slight puff of smoke on the horizon.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Therefore, the highlight of the film is Edwige Fenech, and 
   thankfully she has to run about braless, because if she didn't I'd 
   have been in a coma after the first couple of minutes.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Thank
    God that there's hardly any action in this film, because it was

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's bad enough when the opening credits of a film are so slow that 
   they trick you into thinking you've become trapped in some sort of 
   cinematic event horizon where it's never going to end, but when the 
   film following the credits unfolds with the pace of continental 
   drift, you've got a problem.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then cut to a clearly troubled Marissa Mell, who has a very 
   strange relationship with her husband, banker Philippe Leroy. 
   Philippe works for a high-ranking bank, acting as a courier to ferry 
   funds to certain account holders under the watchful eye of boss 
   George Riguad. Philippe's work often takes him away overnight as he 
   travels to Italy, France, etc with a lot of cash handcuffed to his 
   wrist. Whether or not it's this is causing tensions between them is 
   unclear, but they sit in awkward silence eating dinner until Phillipe 
   breaks a cup and Marissa goes of to check isn't hasn't woken their son.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now, be warned that a lot of this film involves Philippe going back 
   and forth from his work and it's upon returning from one of these 
   trips (via his secret lover Lea Massari) he finds that Massari has 
   discovered their son missing and that a man has called claiming that 
   he has kidnapped him. The kidnapper calls Philippe and tells him he 
   wants loads of cash, but he should go about his business and act 
   normally, so Philippe...goes back and forth between work again. Sigh.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, the kidnapper also has a bit of fun with Marissa, who is 
   demented at the thought of her son being kidnapped and will do 
   anything to get her back. Cue naked Marissa Mell pictures, which the 
   kidnapper develops in his mannequin filled home. He eventually starts 
   putting the pressure on Leroy to come up with the money, but when 
   Leroy is strangely nonchalant about the possibility of his son dying, 
   the kidnapper gets confused and confides in his partner, who turns 
   out to be none other than OH GOD there's a dog having explosive 
   diarrea outside my window, surrounded by laughing homeless people! 
   It's a Christmas miracle - wife, fetch the kids!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's kind of hard to write about a film where nothing really happens 
   about 80% of the time, so all I can say is Philippe Leroy (from the 
   trippy <B><A HREF="laughing_woman_1969.htm">THE LAUGHING WOMAN</A></B> 
   and the introspective semi-Gothic horror <B><A HREF="possessed_1965.htm">THE
    POSSESSED</A></B>) does his best, as does Marissa Mell (from the 
   Spanish giallo <B><A HREF="violent_blood_bath_1973.htm">VIOLENT BLOODBATH</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="marta_1971.htm">MARTA</A></B>, which is also a kind 
   of introspective Gothic horror/Giallo film). There's a decent twist 
   towards the end of the film, but it's clear that director Piero 
   Scuime was a novice, as the editing is choppy and even confusing at 
   times, the pacing is woeful and he doesn't seem particularly 
   interested in injecting any excitement into proceedings. The film 
   even ends with a character on a train (yep, travelling again) while 
   staring into space, flashbacking the plot of the film.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">If
    you've watched any late sixties film starring either Carroll Baker 
   and/or Jean Sorel, you'll know exactly what to expect here; one of 
   those old school giallo films where people try and outsmart each 
   other in huge houses/villas/mansions/castle for usually monetary reasons.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>DIABOLICALLY YOURS</B> wastes no time in building up the 'what's 
   going on this time?' vibe by having hunky Alain Delon waking up after 
   being in a coma for three weeks. Despite being drunk and driving at 
   one hundred miles an hour, Alain has survived a car crash. Even more 
   of a miracle is the survival of his wife, Santa Berger. This takes 
   Alain aback, not because she survived, but the fact that he's married 
   at all. For it would seem that Alain has completely lost his memory 
   due to the crash, but you can never be totally sure with these films.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    By the time he gets out of hospital and gets home, Alain's 
   practically pinching himself. Not only is he married to the beautiful 
   Berger, he lives in a giant mansion, has classic cars lying about 
   everywhere, and a Chinese servant he can order about. What's not to 
   like, apart from Berger never seemingly being in the mood for a bit 
   of love action, and the fact that something just doesn't feel right 
   to Alain. They say that he's George Campos, owner of a construction 
   company, just returned from Hong Kong to live in the country. Alain 
   isn't so sure, because he keeps dreaming of Algeria and what is 
   supposedly his dog wants to take a bite out of him. Then again, he 
   can speak a little Chinese and remembers beating the servant so much 
   he has scars, so what's going on?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Those familiar with these mind-game film is that just about 
   everything that is meant to be true at the start of the film is 
   turned on its head by the end, and even though I was half-right when 
   it came to the mystery, director Duvivier (who has a lot of fans it 
   seems, I'm unfamiliar), throws in plenty of twists all over the shot 
   and plenty of stuff to make even Sherlock Holmes doubt himself, and 
   he was a HUGE fan of giallo films as well as a totally real human 
   being who definitely existed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also, with such flawlessly put together people as Alain Delon and 
   Santa Berger on screen making eyes at each other while veteran 
   Italian actor Sergio Fantoni sits in the background swigging wine, I 
   was aware that as a mere plain human being, if I theoretically 
   appeared onscreen beside them, it would be like some kind of ape-like 
   creature wearing a Guiness t-shirt had somehow wandered onto the set. 
   I guess that's why they are the stars and I'm the whatever it is I do.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In conclusion, it's hard to write about a film without revealing any 
   of the twists.</FONT></FONT></P>

    bloody teenagers and their psychic abilities! You do your best, 
   invite them to stay when their mum dies, and what do they do? Start 
   glaring at things evilly, rub toast on the maid's face, and cause a 
   local doctor to miss his mouth when drinking water.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The girl is Letizia and she looks about as much like a teenager as I 
   look like Beyonce, but let's go with the flow. She arrives at the 
   villa of her Aunt Michela and her husband Gabriele Tinti, and 
   although things start out simple enough, it becomes clear that 
   something is a bit strange about Letizia. First, she comes on to the 
   butler, but at the same time scares the crap out of him by 
   transforming into some sort of demonic Bee-Gee! This affects his 
   sex-life with maid Gassella, who Letizia also comes on to (with some 
   erotic toast rubbing), which somehow causes Gassella to come on to 
   the Aunt. The Aunt resists, but someone is hiding and taking pictures 
   of the naughty deed!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gabriele and the Aunt also take Letizia out for some dinner where 
   they are met by a psychologist (turns out the Aunt has been having 
   some sort of funny turns and may have had a breakdown in the past). 
   Letizia gives him the evil eye, which makes the psychologist simply 
   pour the water down the side of his face. Yes, Letizia has some sort 
   of evil power, but what does she want with the family, and who is 
   that guy hanging around the place, looking sinister?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   this film was made in 1975. There's also a lot of nudity, and 
   Gabriele Tinti gets to sleep with every female in the cast. You get a 
   lot of dodgy visual effects as Letizia walks through walls etc, and a 
   nihilistic ending that's pure seventies gold. Too much screaming

    De Martino's a strange one, from a film making point of view. His 
   films for the most part are competently made and entertaining, but 
   most of them never really take off in terms of excitement or 
   insanity. <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#StrangeShadows1976">STRANGE 
   SHADOWS IN AN EMPTY ROOM</A></B> is the exception here, due to random 
   transvestite fights and what not, but films like <B><A HREF="crime_boss_1972.htm">CRIME

   ICY EYES</A></B> and <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KillerOnPhone1972">THE
    KILLER IS ON THE PHONE</A></B> are examples of how his films never 
   really get going. Technically, they're fine, but they don't get the 
   blood racing. They're just okay films.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Same with <B>DIRTY HEROES</B> I'm afraid. There's a good cast, even 
   a decent battle near the end, and good cinematography, but my god it 
   takes forever to get to the action, and although I think Adolfo Celi 
   has the most Roman 'Roman nose' I've ever seen (sorry Guiseppe 
   Castellano!), even I get bored of looking at it eventually.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's very near the end of World War Two, and three US soldiers have 
   just escaped their prison camp in occupied Holland. One is rugged 
   Frederick Stafford, called Sesame due to his safe cracking skills. 
   Another is an inexplicably red-headed Howard Ross (actually born 
   Howardo Rosso in Rome), another part time crook. The other guy gets 
   killed quickly so we'll never know his occupation. These two escape 
   to the partisans, commanded by Adolfo Celi. Seems like they all have 
   some sort of heist planned in enemy territory, so there's a whole lot 
   of planning and the whole gang to meet, so the first fifty minutes of 
   the film are taken up by this.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The gang include Stafford, Ross and Celi who will be doing most of 
   the leg work, whereas John Ireland (in a bigger role that usual) is a 
   US pilot and former partner of Stafford who will be causing a 
   distraction from the air. On the enemy side is Michel Constantin 
   (from the grim as fuck French film <B><A HREF="track_1975.htm">THE HUNT</A></B>)
    as a German soldier trying to make a bit of cash on the side and 
   Daniela Bianchi, who is coerced into doing the good guy's work 
   because they know she is a Jew hiding in plain sight by being married 
   to General Curd Jurgens, who is guarding the diamonds that are the 
   main purpose of the heist. He's a fairly benevolent leader, knowing 
   the war is done and just trying to keep his remaining troops safe 
   until it all ends. On the other hand, he's got a nasty SS officer who 
   has a serious case of denial going on.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And that's the set up, which is basically the set up for just about 
   every Italian war film from the sixties - it's the plot of <B><A HREF="dirty_dozen_1967.htm">THE
    DIRTY DOZEN</A></B>. When the film gets going it's good enough, with 
   scuba diving and boat chases and such like, but then things slow down 
   again for more talk until mercifully we get a large battle between 
   the US and German forces.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Surprisingly, De Martino then somehow gets ahead of the curve by 
   beating Peter Jackson's <B><A HREF="lord_of_the_rings_trilogy.htm">RETURN
    OF THE KING</A></B> by three decades for somehow making the decision 
   to have us sit through an ending for every single surviving 
   character, which adds on about ten minutes of run time. Thanks for that.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Another alright film from De Martino then. The Morricone soundtrack 
   is okay too, just rising above average now and again, and the film 
   looks rather good, but that's about it really, unless I can somehow 
   go back in time and give De Martino advice about pacing. I'm not 
   going to do that though, because if I ever learn to go back in time 
   I'm going to go back to the early seventies and kill Roy Wood of 
   Wizzard so I'd never have to hear &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas 
   Every Day&quot; ever again.</FONT></FONT></P>

   actors: Tomas Milian! William Berger! Laura Morante!</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">If
    you are a big fan of Milian or Berger and haven't seen this film, I 
   recommend you do not read this review and instead try to track down a 
   copy. I'd never even heard of it, and just happened to notice the 
   title on William Berger's filmography on the IMDb (while researching 
   the film <B><A HREF="#HerHarem1967">HER HAREM</A></B> - review 
   shortly of that). This might be a sci-fi film from Italy during a 
   time where the film industry was waning, but compared to, say, <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Miami Horror">MIAMI
    GOLEM</A></B>, you have a film that might be just as cheap on the 
   effects front, but is completely different in tone and structure.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Hats off to Tomas Milian as well, because I'm not sure many actors 
   could successfully play this role. Here, he plays Bernardo, a 
   recently widowed father of one, trying to put a brave face on for his 
   son while also trying to comfort his grieving mother-in-law. He's so 
   recently bereaved his wife only passed away a few days before the 
   film starts, so he's understandably upset that his son Guiliano 
   arrives for dinner well over an hour late, for the third night 
   running. He's not angry with the kid, merely comforting him and 
   gently asking what took him so long, and when Guiliano answers that 
   he was playing with his mother in the park, Milian's paternal 
   instincts take over and he reckons his son is just having a bit of 
   trouble getting over his mother's death.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things get more serious the next day when Milian is contacted by 
   Guiliano's teacher Renata. It seems that although Milian dropped his 
   son right outside of the school, Guiliano never arrived in class. 
   Remembering that his son said he was playing in the park, Milian 
   heads there, where he finds Guiliano's schoolbook with the word 
   'Mama' writtten on it. The police get involved and eventually 
   Guiliano is found sleeping in some old tunnels next to the park. His 
   excuse is again that he was playing with his mother, but when he 
   presents Milian with the necklace his wife was buried in, things get 
   really strange.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Milian and Renato at first go to the graveyard, where Milian accuses 
   the gravedigger of stealing jewellery. The man protests his 
   innocence, and on the way back home Milian spots his wife from a 
   distance. By now the police, the gravedigger and mayor/doctor William 
   Berger have become involved, as he personally treated Milian's wife 
   and signed the death certificate, but when Milian's wife's coffin is 
   taken to the morgue, occupied only by a dead vagrant, it is found to 
   be empty. Worse still, Milian meets that vagrant in the same tunnels 
   his son slept in the night before...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'll go no further with the plot than the moment Milian comes face 
   to face with his seemingly resurrected wife, because it's this moment 
   that perfectly reflects the tone of the film (and it occurs only 
   about half an hour in, so there's much more to discover here). 
   Director Aurelio Chiesa doesn't go for scares or hysteria (although 
   certain scenes in the film are very atmospheric); he presents a man 
   who has possibly imagined he's already gone through the worst period 
   in his life presented with something he couldn't possibly have 
   predicted, and Milian's conveying of utter incomprehension mixed with 
   grief and love is something to behold. This isn't the loud, screaming 
   Milian of <B><A HREF="brothers_till_we_die_1978.htm">BROTHERS TILL WE DIE</A></B> 
   or the subdued, underplayed Milian of Fulci's <B><A HREF="beatrice_cenci_1969.htm">BEATRICE
    CENCI</A></B>, but a new side - a middle-aged, melancholic side I 
   hadn't seen before, and it's impressive.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He continues in this vein throughout the rest of the film, which has 
   quite a few unexpected turns throughout, as well as a great 
   performance from William Berger as the stoic public representative 
   who wants to subdue stories about corpses walking about and tries to 
   use logic to solve what's going on. He gets his own scene near the 
   end to show off his acting chops too, and nearly pips Milian to the 
   post in the emotional stakes when he breaks down and pleads for help, 
   or even just hope from Milian, which led the point of the film to 
   finally sink in to my not very smart brain.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It was about this point I realised that what is superficially a film 
   about aliens (don't get excited about that - you see as much as some 
   blue laser lights and that's it), is really a film about dealing with 
   bereavement, and the fact that when we lose someone we can't, 
   initially, grasp that they are truly gone and keep hoping for them to 
   walk back in that front door, wishing that anything could bring them 
   back. This is sad film, but not overly so - it does have it's 
   bittersweet moments too, plus an out-of-nowhere full front nude scene 
   by Laura Morante. There's no violence as such save for two nasty road 
   accidents, but this film doesn't need anything like that - <B>DISTANT LIGHTS</B> 
   is its own kind of entity. There's even a mix of comedy and horror 
   when one poor fellow is mistaken for a reanimated person and get 
   locked in a room with a load of actual reanimated people.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I don't know if this Claudio Argento produced film is well known or 
   not, or even if an English language or subtitled version is 
   available, but it should be more popular. It took me totally by 
   surprise, and I did find myself welling up now and again (note - I 
   may just be insane, however). One of the few other Italian films that 
   managed that was the Edwige Fenech tearjerker <B><A HREF="anna_the_passion_the_torment_1973.htm">ANNA:

    bit of advice for kids and parents of kids - don't have massive 
   arguments with each other that you later regret, because sometimes 
   the chance to make up never comes, be it through accident, disease, 
   or your kid's entire school getting caught in a time slip and thrown 
   in the future. A bad future.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This happens to young Sho (Yasufumi Hayashi), who storms out on his 
   mother after she scolds him for dancing around her naked singing 
   Camptown Races (I say she had good cause) and refusing to attend 
   Japanese class. You see Sho and his family have just returned from 
   Los Angeles and now Sho is attending an international school full of 
   international students, which I guess is why quite a bit of the film 
   is in English. It also gives us quite a variety of characters, as one 
   hundred and eighty-one kids find themselves in a future full of sand, 
   monsters, and death.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sho withstanding, the pupils include a nice girl who fancies a rich, 
   athletic white boy who proves to be one of the more complicated 
   characters here, a fat guy called Piggy, an American kid who can't 
   stop chewing bubblegum (who gets the film's most spectacular death), 
   two sets of twins, a girl who keeps fainting, a very young kid called 
   Yu who followed Sho to the school, and a scientist-like kid who 
   provides what little exposition were allowed in this crazy film. 
   Adults include actor Troy Donohue, who has the hots for the lovely 
   young teacher who becomes a mother figure for everyone, an old lady 
   who doesn't seem to mind what's happening, and a delivery guy who 
   becomes violently insane because his dog was turned into a skeleton 
   (but also seems still alive in the 'past'), The amount of characters 
   becomes rather overwhelming as even more are introduced after the 
   entire school ends up in a bizarre place where it rains sand.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's a lot of elements to this film that's like a cheesy kids 
   movie, which includes teeny-bopper romance and TWO somehow 
   spontaneously occurring dance/music numbers (one based on Here Comes 
   The Bride, and the other Camptown Races again!), a bit of <B><A HREF="et_the_extra_terrestrial_1982.htm">ET</A></B>,
    by which I mean the strange creature who befriends young kid Yu (and 
   pisses on him [?]). This thing looks like a green arse with chameleon 
   eyes on its cheeks and prawn legs. It's initial appearance is a head 
   frying stop-motion sequence that kind of signals that the film has 
   stopped being plain weird and is now heading for completely weird territory.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then there's the horror: one guy's face is melted by boiling water, 
   sand pours from a dead teacher's mouth, and one kid has his entire 
   flesh melted off his body. There are large monsters that attack the 
   school and the kids violently attack each other. I'm not even 
   particularly going into these scenes in great detail as I wouldn't 
   want to spoil the crazy imagery for anyone, but advise that you seek 
   it out yourself (it's made an HD appearance on YouTube as of March 
   2020, so you better be quick).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What makes the film so watchable is that you actually care for the 
   kids. Sho at first comes across as a hyperactive pain in the ass, but 
   then as his guilt about his last meeting with his mother sinks in, 
   her image becomes his focus to be a better person. His mother (one of 
   the few characters not thrown into the future who never gives up on 
   her son's vanishing) tries to contact him (and does, in a way you'll 
   have to see for yourself). This, along with a lot of the characters 
   being generally nice (rather than selfish and duplicitous, as you 
   might find in other horror films), makes you care about what's 
   happening and makes the ending rather poignant.. Or it might be that 
   I've slept about six hours in the last three days and would probably 
   find the ending of Luigi Cozzi's <B><A HREF="#Hercules1983">HERCULES</A></B> 
   sad because he didn't throw enough stuff into outer space. For the 
   record, this Japanese horror film features the most well-rounded, 
   lovable and sensible characters I've ever seen in a film. Filmmakers 
   should do that more, in this world where everyone is angry about 
   everything all the time about ideologies they didn't even know they 
   cared about until the Internet and the Media shoved it down their throats.</FONT></FONT></P>

   thrown in for good measure.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Emma is a mentally unstable girl with no family and a dire fear of 
   becoming blind, so you can imagine how lucky she must a have felt 
   when she was run over by a car driven by a psychiatric nurse who then 
   subsequently took her in to care for her, nurse her, and give her a 
   bit of the old sapphic love. Doctor George Riguad voices a small 
   voice of caution towards the whole matter, but then it turns out he's 
   not in the film much anyway, so that's pretty much disregarded right 
   then and there.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The nurse, Perla Cristal (from hilarious William Shatner playing

   country house, but Emma's clearly a few beers short of a six pack and 
   terrorises the help. Perla has also hooked up with a rich 
   businessman, which does not please Emma one bit. I've got to admit 
   that in Emma's defence Perla sure gives out a lot of mixed messages, 
   from running her over to taking her in to care for her to slapping 
   her around for hanging around with psychic Lupe to threatening to put 
   her back in the asylum to trying to protect her after Emma goes nuts 
   and knifes Perla's lover to death.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The pair run off to the country, but Emma has got a serious neurosis 
   going on about people wanting to put her back into the loony bin, so 
   Perla's going to have to watch where she stores her sharp blades. 
   Just when you think you know where the film is heading, we get a nice 
   excursion into horror territory as a couple of hippies decide to be 
   Emma's friends, and you know hippies - act like assholes without fear 
   of retribution. Then again, you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Benefiting greatly from being very short at seventy-five minutes, <B>EMMA,
    DARK DOORS</B> just rolls along nicely, giving us some bloody kills 
   along the way and even throwing in some Bava-like head games when the 
   story randomly turns into a haunted house film. Susanna East does

   <FONT FACE="Arial Black,Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE="4">The End of Eternity<A NAME="EndOfEternity1984"></A> 
   (1984, Italy, Sci-fi/Experimental, Director: Ernesto Gastaldi)</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT FACE="Arial Black,Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE="3">Notable 
   actors: Mara Maryl! Ernesto Gastaldi!</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Look,
    it&#146;s an experimental home movie that wasn&#146;t intended for 
   release that&#146;s now been uploaded onto YouTube by director 
   Ernesto Gastaldi (on the 'Ernest Astaldi' channel &#150; is that a 
   joke or did he miss a couple of buttons there?). Two things you need 
   to know about this film &#150; it&#146;s not very good as you&#146;d 
   imagine, but Ernesto Gastaldi pretends to be the voice of an 
   interstellar chicken Maryl keeps in a box, so it&#146;s not a total 
   washout either.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film is in Italian without subtitles and is very dialogue heavy 
   with garbled sound, but from what I manage to discern, Mara is a middle-aged
    domestic seer (just like in Guilio Questi&#146;s <B><A HREF="arcana_1972.htm">ARCANA</A></B>)
    who lives with a much younger other half (played by her real life 
   son). They&#146;ve been existing mainly on income from her crystal 
   ball readings and owe a hell of a lot of money to people. In fact, 
   what may be a bailiff turns up to value their belongings and only 
   gives them a bit of ley way when Mara does him an impromptu free reading.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most of the first half of this hour-long film mainly involves Mara 
   and her young husband arguing about money, life, and existence. There 
   may have been some talk about a child they had that died young but I 
   may be wrong there. This culminates in an argument where Mara&#146;s 
   crystal ball is destroyed, and just when all is lost, the chicken 
   they keep in a box starts talking and promises Mara great fame and fortune.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It&#146;s pretty hard to make out the dialogue when Ernesto Gastaldi 
   is screaming it in a high-pitched chicken voice, but it&#146;s also 
   hilariously ludicrous that Mara engages the chicken in conversation 
   and receives an egg containing a key &#150; a key to success, money 
   and fame.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What we get is Mara becoming famous and receiving award after award 
   (on a budget of about ten lira) while the viewer gets a nostalgic 
   trip through all of Mara&#146;s previous films, like <B><A HREF="lonely_violent_beach_1971.htm">THE
    LONELY VIOLENT BEACH</A></B>, <B><A HREF="#NightWithCries1981">NIGHT 
   WITH CRIES</A></B>, <B><A HREF="#CheersToCyanide1968">CHEERS TO CYANIDE</A></B> 
   and what will always be her crowning achievement, the excellent <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Libido1965">LIBIDO</A></B>.
    Considering the rumour that poor Mara is suffering from advance 
   Alzheimer&#146;s and reportedly can&#146;t remember her career, I was 
   a bit touched by this sequence.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There&#146;s an ironic twist to the film too, and an ending where 
   the space chicken is travelling into outer space screeching 
   &#147;Andromeda! What are you waiting for?&#148;. Silly stuff and 
   probably not meant for mass consumption, but a real curio for 
   completists like me who are huge fans of both Gastaldi and Maryl. <B>(<FONT COLOR="MAROON">EDITOR'S

   Italy, Sci-fi, Director: Ugo Tognazzi)</FONT></FONT><BR>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">In
    2021, it's not that hard to imagine that the youth of today would 
   reject consumerism and live sterile, ordered lives to preserve the 
   human race and keep down the population, and it's not that hard that 
   my generation, used to sparking up a spliff and necking ecstasy 
   tablets two at a time, would reject such a notion and descend into 
   fatalistic hedonism, resorting to flatulent. bingo-winged boffing 
   while ignoring the fact that our sons and daughters are now 
   systematically eliminating us from society.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Such is the world that DJ Orso (director, actor, screenwriter and 
   fluffer Ugo Tognazzi) finds himself in. In the future, the world has 
   become so shitty that the youth conform to some organisation called 
   the ESP, wear bland clothes of grey and white, do not partake of any 
   fun and more importantly send anyone reaching the age of fifty to a 
   holiday camp. Permanently. Ugo, a popular DJ, has now reached this 
   age and at the urging of his compliant kids and grandson, is not 
   setting off on holiday with his wife Ornella Vanoni. Both have their 
   own view on this strange new law that's been implemented, with Orso 
   being more vocal about this new sterile generation. &quot;You have an 
   anus, I have an arse,&quot; he says. &quot;You copulate, I fuck,&quot;
    The young folk are all like 'whatever grandad' and send him off anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We get a kind of road trip sequence as Orso, his wife, kids and 
   grandkid travel to the holiday destination, stopping off for a weird 
   party in the some woods where decadent twins kill themselves as loads 
   of middle-aged people dance around naked, Orso has a bit of a hissy 
   fit ordering coffee (those designated for 'holiday' are given arm 
   bands that affords them free beverages on the way), hits his son, 
   which results in his daughter being blackmailed into sex by the 
   coffee server in order to stop him calling the ESP police, and Orso 
   going off on some half-arsed escape attempt that comes to nothing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eventually, they end up at the holiday camp anyway. The camp seems 
   kind of nice (the cinematography here is great, and is apparently a 
   real place in Spain, somewhere). Everyone seems happy enough, smoking 
   state-sanctioned grass, getting wasted, and getting it on with the 
   younger servants in exchange for their possessions. Orso is dismayed 
   to find a former suitor of his wife (William Berger) is on site and 
   seems to be getting the green light from Ornella. Even worse is the 
   discovery of the horrific Game everyone has to play every night. It's 
   like a reverse Bingo, so if you have cards left, you 'win' a cruise, 
   from which you never come back from.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    With Ornella sensibly commencing an affair with super hunky Berger, 
   Orso has no choice but get slightly involved in some sort of 
   resistance, smoke dope and get hooked up with youngster Corrine Clery 
   (from <B><A HREF="#KleinhoffHotel1977">KLEINHOFF HOTEL</A></B> and 
   Fulci's perv-tastic <B><A HREF="devils_honey_1986.htm">THE DEVIL'S HONEY</A></B> 
   (which is out there on the 'net if you remove enough safe filters 
   from your browser).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So yes, it's basically <B><A HREF="logans_run_1976c.htm">LOGAN'S RUN</A></B>,
    Italian style. The sets are amazing, the empty, emotionless human 
   society portrayed rather well. Ornella Vanoni is pretty good as the 
   divided wife of Orso, driven to seek some sort of sensuous oblivion 
   that leads to some pretty emotional scenes later in the film, as is 
   Berger, with his boyish charm and subtle defeatism, but it's 
   Tognazzi's performance that this film hinges on, ranging from 
   defiant, to resigned to horny to having some stubble. Pretty versatile.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Film &amp; Clips, who are uploading far too many Clips when they 
   should be uploading films, sneaked this one about a year ago with 
   English subs. It's not that exciting, has no gore, loads of 
   middle-aged nudity, but is still pretty good.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">So,
    my wife walked in on me the other day while I was rubbing sandpaper 
   on my balls in the kitchen and quite rightly was curious as to why I 
   was indulging in such an activity.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Well,&quot; I began, pausing to dip my toes into some boiling 
   vegetable oil, &quot;During lockdown, I've discovered that I like 
   inflicting pain on myself. I guess during this difficult and 
   snack-filled time we have all had to resort to various tactics in 
   order to pass the endless hours we've had to spend locked inside. 
   Mine is to, from time to time, use a cheese grater on my arse cheeks 
   for my own personal gratification, It just, you know, stops me from 
   breaking into our downstairs neighbour's house and beating him to 
   death with a toilet cistern lid because he won't stop fucking 
   drilling things.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;That's okay,&quot; my wife replied, &quot;As you say, we've 
   all got to get our kicks somehow. Mine has been to lace dog treats 
   with poison and leave them scattered around the park across the road. 
   There's just something about a dog owner's face when their dog goes 
   into agonising paroxysms that, you know, just helps temper the 
   obsessive thoughts about murdering that neighbour who gets drunk 
   every Friday night and plays Sinead O'Connor's &quot;Nothing Compares 
   2 U&quot; at full volume. I mean, he's fucking long term unemployed! 
   Why is he celebrating a Friday night - was it a hard week sitting on 
   his arse doing nothing but smoking skunk and drinking Malibu? 
   However, if I may offer you some advice, you have not suffered enough 
   pain until you have sat through <B>THE EXORCIST: ITALIAN STYLE</B>.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;You have piqued my interest,&quot; I said, wiring up my 
   nipples to the microwave, &quot;And it is strange that you, who have 
   literally no interest in Italian films, should suggest a rare title 
   to me, the sad, bald, Italian film enthusiast cursed to watch every 
   Italian film ever made! Pass me those pliers, and tell me of this 
   film. Is it like <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondTheDoor1974">BEYOND
    THE DOOR</A></B>? I liked that one. Or is like that <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Magdalena1974">MAGDALENA</A></B> 
   one where the girl ran around shouting about her fanny the entire film?&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;No, it is not. <B>THE EXORCIST: ITALIAN STYLE</B> is a horror 
   comedy by comedy duo Franco and Ciccio, only Franco isn't here for 
   some reason. Ciccio Ingrassio (whom I believe you liked in the film <B><A HREF="#TodoModo1976">TODO
    MODO</A></B>) wrote, directed, and starred in this one. It's kind of 
   just <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE EXORCIST</A></B>, only instead of 
   one person being possessed by Satan, there's multiple people as the 
   possession comes from whoever has a strange amulet on their person.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Go on,&quot; I said, and took a casual drink of bleach.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Well, first to get possessed is the son of the mayor, who is 
   shit at football one minute, but when he has the amulet on his 
   person, he's able to kick a football through a tree, swears a lot, 
   and sexually assaults women while stealing their underwear.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;So he's like sixteen or seventeen or something?&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;No, he's ten.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Well, we'd better move on from that and not think about it too much.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;I agree. The family need someone to help them out, so they 
   turn to Ciccio Ingrassia, a fake guru/exorcist who dresses up as a 
   priest and goes to the kid's house, where the kid has a fight with 
   everyone that's almost good, so they ruin it by including a Benny 
   Hill-style chase sequence. Then he drops the amulet and his sister 
   picks it up so she turns from a quiet girl to doing a striptease in 
   front of her family. Then they do the exorcism scene from <B>THE EXORCIST</B>,
    only using chillies instead of crucifixes, but you get all the stuff 
   flying about the room and all that. Plus, instead of pea soup, one of 
   them gets hit in the face with cheese. Speaking of cheese, can you 
   hand me the cheddar, some razor blades, and some nails?&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Sure - here you go. Tell me more of this film, for it sounds 
   like while watching it I would cringe so much my testicles would 
   retract into my body and sprout out of my ears, which would be rather 
   unconventional, but would also act as ad hoc ear warmers during the 
   winter season.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Indeed. So, the girl loses the amulet and it ends up in the 
   hands of the mayor's wife, who proceeds to grow a beard that leads to 
   an interminable scene in a barbers. Later, the mayor himself ends up 
   with it and does the head-spinning thing while pissing on a stage, 
   which leads to a rock-n-roll song that strangely predates the shitty 
   &quot;Devil in A Blue Dress&quot; from the film <B><A HREF="repossessed_1990.htm">REPOSSESSED</A></B>.
    Then, Ingrassia eats the amulet and explodes. For some reason.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;I've got to admit the film sounds painful, but I have also got 
   to ask, is there any point in me watching now that you've told me the 
   entire plot?&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;I've not got time to answer these questions as I now have to 
   go to the park.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I watched on as my wife lifted a carrier bag laden with dog treats.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;I'm off now,&quot; she said, and turned to me, &quot;One more 
   thing - do not shove the kid's pet rats up your arse again. I don't 
   know how they accepted my last explanation, but I'm not going to be 
   able to come up with another excuse like that.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   and <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#DarkBar1989">DARK BAR</A></B>), 
   is a blind shoplifter who is left behind in a department store so her 
   disfigured boyfriend Karl can go fetch the car, resulting in Elisa 
   being locked in the store. Seems she just waited in a changing 
   cubicle. I guess the staff don&#146;t check those before they leave, 
   so if you&#146;re in the mood to rob somewhere you might want to take 
   note of that. While Karl is trying to figure out a way back into the 
   store, Elisa is wandering around trying to find the exit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Up in the store&#146;s office sexy secretary Lorandana Romito (from

    has just snuck her boyfriend in for a bit of a love-in, not knowing 
   that her sleazy boss Alessio Orano has also hung around so he can 
   sneakily watch them getting it on. However, he accidentally knocks 
   over a pot plant and scares off the boyfriend, leaving him to chase 
   his secretary around and kill her right outside of the shop Elisa is 
   trapped in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A security guard then finds the shocked Elisa and the corpse, but 
   gets into a short scuffle with Karl, who will make a habit of turning 
   up at the wrong place and the wrong time throughout this entire film. 
   Cops descend on the place, including Mary Sellers (also <B><A HREF="stage_fright_1987_blu-ray.htm">STAGEFRIGHT</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Ghosthouse 1987">GHOSTHOUSE</A></B>),
    who is the deputy for hunky cop Marra. Now, I was willing to cut 
   Bava a lot of slack over everything that happened up to this point, 
   but when the plot asks for the police to take Elisa from the shopping 
   mall all the way to a police station, get her up a flight of stairs 
   and into an office, then standing shouting at her before her 
   boyfriend actually has to tell the cops she&#146;s blind, we&#146;re 
   in that special &#145;Lamberto Bava&#146; zone again. The plot 
   remains in this zone for the rest of the film. It's like <B><A HREF="twilight_zone_original_tv_series.htm">THE
    TWILIGHT ZONE</A></B>, only really fucking stupid.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Elisa&#146;s excuse for not telling the cops that she&#146;s blind 
   is that she and Karl are part of a rural commune run entirely by 
   disabled people who produce art and flowers to make cash (she left 
   out shoplifting there), and they are all committed to acting as if 
   they have no infirmities at all times, even apparently if they are 
   involved in a violent murder case. Even more brain damaging is the 
   cops bringing the store manager down to the station, too, but not 
   treating him like a suspect to the point that they even mention that 
   there was a female eyewitness to the murder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film is so idiotic I&#146;m actually in pain recounting the 
   plot, but the cops then ignore the store manager's suspicious and 
   startled look, and then HE looks over at Marra talking to his deputy 
   and decides &#147;There&#146;s a female talking to that cop I met 
   back in the shop. She must be the eyewitness! I must kill her!&#148;. 
   Coincidentally, the deputy is staying in the same hotel apartment as 
   Elisa but the killer doesn&#146;t notice Elisa, plus Karl also turns 
   up straight after the murder to compound things for himself, and then 
   even though the murderer finds out he killed the wrong person, they 
   just leave Elisa in the same hotel anyway, and that&#146;s after they 
   leave her alone in the middle of the street to chase after Karl.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I&#146;m genuinely getting a headache from trying to remember all 
   this now, but surely Bava just didn&#146;t give a shit what happened 
   in these films at this point? My plot description stops around the 
   halfway mark of the film&#146;s running time, so there&#146;s a 
   shitload of other stuff to get through here until you get to the 
   film&#146;s unintentionally hilarious finale. There&#146;s a romantic 
   subplot that involves boiling water in a paper cup using candlelight, 
   Marra just straight up bitch-slapping Elisa for some reason, and Karl 
   trying to escape the cops by going into a public toilet and squeezing 
   himself through a gap in a wall into an adjoining toilet. Not a 
   toilet cubicle, but an entire different room that also functions as a 
   toilet. What the fuck?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Well, it was good for a laugh at least. There&#146;s some throwbacks 
   to his father&#146;s work, like the murderer self-flagellating with a 
   huge whip, some black gloves, and the commune is full of weird and 
   wonderful art. I would say this one is worth enduring for the sheer 
   amount of ridiculousness Bava expects you to take on board, and the 
   ending which involves a plan so convoluted and unlikely it's like 
   Bava didn't even expect anyone to actually watch this film, let alone 
   enjoy it.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Yes, this is one of those broad Italian comedies, but for once it is 
   actually funny, to me at least. It involves a bunch of friends who 
   all work in a hotel, trying to set their mate up with the sexy 
   DJ/dancer lady who works in the disco called John's Fever. The mate 
   is Gianni, the cook at the hotel, and a goofy, awkward sort, with his 
   bushy moustache and giant glasses. He's a terrible dancer too, but 
   underneath that exterior lies a face that rather closely resembles 
   belly-buttoned chinned disco-visiting mad shagger John Travolta. 
   Could that possibly be the key to getting that DJ to let him on her 
   proud mary?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Assisting Gianni in his transformation are his mates, and as they 
   all pretty much share the entire screen time with Gianni, let's find 
   out who they are. First up is hotel porter Massimo Vanni (from 
   excellent Eurocrime film <B><A HREF="first_action_hero_1994.htm">FIRST
    ACTION HERO</A></B> and most famous in Italy for backing up Tomas 
   Milian in those <A HREF="cop_in_blue_jeans_1976.htm">Inspector</A> <A HREF="hit_squad_1976.htm">Giraldi</A> <A HREF="swindle_1977.htm">films</A>).
    super-hot Italian actress Sonia Viviani (from <B><A HREF="last_guappo_1978.htm">THE
    LAST GUAPPO</A></B> and my dreams, which also perhaps features 
   Massimo Vanni, too), Adriana Russo, who continually locks her boss in 
   the clothes shop she works in within the hotel, Claudio Bigagli who 
   is a bag boy, some guy who operates the lift, and a 
   Travolta-obssessed switchboard operator. Pretty much everyone appears 
   on screen all the time throughout the entire film, getting into jolly japes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For a change, however, the japes are jolly! I did actually laugh at 
   some of the gags in this film, from the Bee Gee piss-take disco track 
   that consists solely of their high-pitched 'Ah!' noises, to Massimo 
   Vanni's accident prone slapstick (let's admit it, he's not John 
   Gielgud, but a physical actor, so it works here). There are many sub 
   plots that carry the film along too, mainly the hotel receptionist 
   who has learned to sleep with his eyes open but in doing so leaves 
   himself open to continual pranks from the main cast. He also gets to 
   be the experimental subject for the group testing how closely Gianni 
   resembles John Travolta, which leads to him actually punching the 
   real John Travolta, who turns up at the hotel. Or at least an actor's 
   legs pretending to be his turns up.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I was getting a bit worried around the middle of the film when the 
   disco music dried up but when Gianni turns up at the club in Travolta 
   mode that all kicked back in again, providing us disco fiends with 
   plenty of disco action. The entire soundtrack is on YouTube by the 
   way, so somebody out there cares. Interestingly, the soundtrack 
   includes a track by Linda Lee, who sings that awesome dark disco song 
   that's playing in <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS</A></B> 
   when Ian McCulloch and Tisa Farrow are trying to sneak onto the boat. 
   That's called 'There's No Matter' and was a single, backed by the 
   b-side 'Love was the Magic', which leads me to believe that English 
   probably wasn't Linda's first language. Fulci also used one of her 
   songs in The Psychic too. She's woefully underrepresented on YouTube.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Suspiciously, they even include a Massimo Vanni combat sequence 
   where he does a few stunts. This takes place during a huge disco dancing/fight
    scene at the end of the film. It's like someone went into the future 
   and discovered that a sad bastard (me) was a huge fanboy of Vanni, 
   then went back in time and added that to the script. You do get 
   plenty of Vanni screen time here, so try not to blow a gasket when he 
   flicks he eyes straight at you at the end of the film and does a 
   cheeky 'sniff' expression. I was just recovering from Sonia Viviani 
   doing a double eye wink send off at that point. Ruined a perfectly 
   good pair of boxers shorts right there and then.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In conclusion, I bet that Travolta lookalike Guiseppe Spezia looks 
   more like John Travolta now than John Travolta does, seeing that 
   Travolta looks like a peanut that's fallen behind a cooker and is 
   only discovered years later when the cooker is removed, sporting a 
   proud beard of fungus around it's lower half.</FONT></FONT></P>

   but compounding the crapness is Antonio Margheriti Godfrey Ho-ing 
   some other film into certain scenes (or rather, building scenes 
   around the footage he's 'borrowed'). I'm almost certain this is what 
   happens in this film, but I can't check, nor am I an expert enough in 
   Peplum to identify the film the footage has been nicked from.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The ultra-thin storyline involves the persecutions of Christians in 
   Rome after the death of the Emperor Constantine (himself big on the bible-bashing),
    this means that Romans who are enthusiastic for polytheism are 
   turning on their Christian fellows, even if they are in a 
   high-ranking position like tribune Marcus and his wife (Ida Galli, 
   a.k.a. &quot;Evelyn Stewart&quot;). Marcus goes from beefy nice guy 
   to homeless beefy nice guy fleeing for his life while being chasing 
   by his own soldiers. His wife is gravely injured, but only by 
   breaking a dam and flooding the plain below does Marcus escape. It 
   also gives good ol' Antonio Margheriti the chance to break out the 
   minature sets and provide us with one of the few interesting scenes 
   in the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcus hooks up with a barbarian tribe, but not soon enough to save 
   Ida. Then again, her death means Marcus has got the green light for 
   barbarian Svelta (Loredana Nusciak), so it's a kind of &quot;glass 
   half empty, glass half full&quot; kind of situation, and Svelta in my 
   opinion is definitely an upgrade on Ida Galli. Marcus goes all <B><A HREF="dances_with_wolves_1990.htm">DANCES
    WITH WOLVES</A></B> with this tribe, but when he gets the offer to 
   fight in the arena in order to free his Christian homies, he's back 
   in Rome before you can say &quot;Jesus, has only half an hour of this 
   film went by?&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I was going to slag off Marcus's moobs but now that I've been 
   trapped with my kids during lockdown for months on end doing nothing 
   but eating and drinking beer I'm just going to shut up about that and 
   move onto to the stolen footage. From here on in, whenever the film 
   has to get to something epic, footage from another film creeps in, be 
   it shots of a crowd watching Marcus take on gladiators in the arena, 
   or the big battle at the end, some other film kicks in, with some 
   close up shots of Marcus and whoever to pad things out a bit. In 
   Margheriti's defence he does pull out the tiny sets in the end when 
   Rome gets destroyed either by God or by an earthquake. I'm not 
   watching this again to double check.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <B>THE FALLS</B> is a fake documentary detailing the survivors of 
   something called the Violent Unknown Event, an event with an 
   epicentre located in London or possibly Wales. Many people died, and 
   the VUE commission have compiled a directory of the nineteen million 
   survivors, of which The Falls is a cross-reference of that directory,

    Most sensible people, upon reading the above paragraph, would have 
   run a mile by now, and even those made curious by it might ditch the

   ninety-two different experimental films, and also a chance to set up 
   what would make up his universe for future films. It's like a 
   milestone in his career, a closing chapter on his obsessive listing 
   in his short films. Like <B><A HREF="peter_greenaway_short_films_1975-1979.htm">A

    The victims of the VUE all start speaking different languages 
   (ninety-two of them), so Greenaway gets stuck into the various 
   aspects of that, and they also start behaving or displaying the 
   traits of various birds, so there's endless references to flight, 
   both by bird and man, references to eggs and migration, a man thinks 
   a turkey contains the spirit of his dead wife, another plans to fly 
   from the top of a skyscraper. And there's three hours of this.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Greenaway does try to present the material in various fashions, from 
   straight documentary style to references to <B><A HREF="alphaville_1965.htm">ALPHAVILLE</A></B>,
    cut-ups, fast editing, found footage, all the while building this 
   world of absolute nonsense that tries to figure out what the VUE is, 
   but in the end just muddies the waters so much that you are better 
   viewing the film as an absurdist take on stern British documentaries.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's if any of it happened at all, as the ninety-first entry

   telephone including the ninety-second entry.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The music keeps things going too, from Michael Nyman's ever evolving

    From what I can gather, student Anne is obsessed with Egyptology and 
   either imagines herself to be or actually is the Goddess Isis. 
   Whatever the truth is, she has a dream one night where a voice 
   (Osiris?) makes her go out into a fantasy Egypt land and dig up a 
   necklace. The voice also tells her wear it or else someone will get 
   hurt. So that's Anne. Then we have Jeff, who I think is Anne's 
   brother? He's just hooked up with Susan, and she's brought in friend 
   Nancy, who goes all weird when the Egyptian stuff is mentioned. All 
   four, plus some random guy called Sam, decide to go camping 
   somewhere, and it takes them nearly half the film to get around to 
   making that decision!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most of that time is taken up with people just standing around 
   talking, although Anne does dream her mirror is bleeding now and 
   again. Anne also dreams of an aggressive black dog, played by the 
   least aggressive looking Labrador you've ever seen, dubbed with evil 
   roars! I guess that's supposed to be Anubis. Maybe. Anyways, there's 
   a whole load of dialogue before the horror bit starts proper 
   fifty-four minutes in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Plot aside, I've got to admit that eventually the whole film has a 
   kind of <B><A HREF="garth_marenghis_darkplace_2004.htm">GARTH MARENGHI</A></B>-vibe,
    only genuine. Lines are flubbed left right and centre, edits don't 
   make any sense, people run holding hands through the woods but in 
   close up they are running alone. It was only when I realised I should 
   be concentrating on that stuff that I started to enjoy the film. 
   There's a scene where two girls decide to go for a swim, and you can 
   clearly see one of them trying to keep a poker face while the rocks 
   under her bare feet are clearly causing discomfort.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I don't know why Adeeb Barsoum decided to keep all the horror 
   elements to a minimum, but hats off to him for including one of the 
   most hilarious fight scenes I've ever seen, right at the end of the 
   film. Who wants brutal fist fighting when the two combatants can 
   simply tug on the sleeves of their opponent and kind of jerk back and 
   forth a bit? Better still, it's intercut with shots of the black 
   labrador with evil dog sound overdubs. I also laughed at loud at the 
   brutally insulting, sudden ending.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It only cost a grand to make according to the IMDb, and I don't like 
   to be down on films that are labours of love, but this one is pretty 
   funny in its awfulness. Bad movie fans could pick this one to pieces, 
   which I guess was the motive of the guy who uploaded it onto YouTube.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Hotel owners Paolo and Silvia have a terrible relationship that they 
   try and hide from their guests and customers. Paolo is cheating on 
   his wife. During a wedding. In the basement. He makes as much effort 
   at hiding his tracks it's like as a side project he was hired to plan 
   the 'suicide' of Jeffrey Epstein. And he's not the only one. They are 
   all at it in this film. These days we're all too distracted by 
   YouTube lists and Coronavirus updates to make the beast with two 
   backs, but in the Eighties that's all they could ever think of.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Silvia heads off somewhere one day and Paolo takes his girlfriend 
   for a ride (a real one) in his posh car. Not long after, he's 
   involved in an accident that makes him blind. The young motorcyclist 
   that nearly loses his life due to Paolo feels strangely guilty about 
   being involved, and then gets some strange movements in his 
   undercarriage once he spots pouty, busty Silvia and her blind 
   husband. He's a jobbing actor, but Silvia hires him anyway and after 
   catching her husband getting it on with his mistress while blind (!), 
   she thinks 'to hell with this' and gets it on with the young fella.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Things get pretty tedious by this point because all the viewer has 
   endured is endless scenes of people getting it on while other people 
   listen in or watch them. I was wondering if anything was going to 
   happen when at last Silvia comes up with a plot to kill her blind 
   husband and get his inheritance. Things are complicated by her lover 
   being a reluctant killer and the fact that he also has a bit on the 
   side who might be in for a spot of blackmail once it all kicks 
   off...and I mean kick off like a small kitten accidentally batting a 
   cotton ball into a pile of odd socks.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Now, this film basically exists on YouTube in a copy about one hour 
   eight minutes long. I was thinking to myself &quot;This film must 
   have been filthy before it was edited - I must track down a longer 
   version and confirm this for academic reasons&quot;. So I found an 
   Italian language version on YouTube (by using Yahoo or Bing to search 
   for the film because a direct search on YouTube doesn't bring up the 
   film. I have no idea why this happens), and that version runs at one 
   hour seventeen minutes, and that version is tame as hell!. There's 
   one shot of actress Loredana Romito having a shower, and the rest of 
   the footage cut out involves thigh stroking, moaning, and Paolo 
   smashing a vase. What was this film edited for? A children's TV channel?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Worse still, the lame attempts to create a giallo atmosphere 
   basically end in a wet fart. There's a murder, then a mysterious 
   murder, then a bizarre random gunfight, then the film is over. I am 
   VERY lenient when it comes to late Eighties Italian films (I love 
   them basically), but this was a poor, poor effort.</FONT></FONT></P>

   Well, it was okay I guess, but it's an entire hour before the film 
   gets around to the Giallo stuff, and I'm talking the old school, soft 
   Giallo of lovers plotting against spouses, with more erotica thrown 
   in for good measure. Monica Guerritore seems to have made a living 
   from these erotic Gialli, so if anyone wants to upload more, I'd be 
   grateful. However, this is a film that isn't really worth tracking 
   down - the cinematography is too 'nineties' in execution and was 
   almost like a TV movie, so there's none of that style you'd expect 
   from such a film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    George Martin (from Spanish horror film <B><A HREF="diabolical_shudder_1972.htm">DIABOLICAL

   killed the owner. The owner's widow agrees to pay Craig Hill and his 
   gang seven thousand dollars to get those horses back, which Hill 
   agrees to. After a bit of investigation (and a few shoot-outs), Hill 
   finds that Martin has set up shop at a ranch owned by the widow Cook, 
   her sister, and her daughter. Her sister is due to marry hunky Howard 
   Ross the next day, but for now they are busy dealing with a 
   mysterious new neighbour and a bunch of hairy-ass cowboys sleeping in 
   the barn.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Strange thing is, when Hill and his gang turn up, there's no shoot

   scam the widow for the reward money. That would be all well and good, 
   except for someone murdering all three women in the middle of the 
   night. Everyone's blissfully sleeping in the barn when Howard Ross 
   shows up to get married and discovers the bodies. He also finds a 
   bunch of strangers sleeping in the barn. Rather than take on a lot of 
   guys, he sneaks back to town and forms a rather huge posse. By this 
   time Hill and Martin have found the corpses and realise who's going 
   to get the blame for it. They barely escape before the posse comes 
   gunning for them, but how are they going to prove their innocence 
   when facing a hail of bullets, and who among them did kill the women?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Others might find the build up slow, but once this film gets going 
   it's pretty much action all the way, and it takes it's own route 
   plot-wise, rather than the old tired plots of bounty hunters and 
   corrupt businessmen. Here we have two gangs who barely trust each 
   other trying to survive together while being chased across the 
   endless landscape by bloodthirsty townspeople as one by one the gangs 
   get whittled down. There's plenty of violence and grim sights on 
   display, like the townsfolk hanging the bullet ridden corpses from 
   gallows so that the remaining gang members can see what fate they are 
   going to meet. Whereas I never seem to read a good word about Craig 
   Hill or George Martin, both do well here. They are not just 
   caricatures - they are complex characters trying to outsmart each 
   other and the law. Even minor characters get a chance to stand out - 
   the sheriff trying to calm the baying mob, the protective gang member 
   who embarks on a suicide mission to avenge his kid friend, and the 
   Scottish religious couple who sound like Groundskeeper Willie.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The cinematography by good old Stelvio Massi always helps too. I

    don&#146;t want to mess with Miami cop Fabio Testi. He loathes crime 
   and corruption, and he really hates it when his partner is crippled 
   by a masked gunman at a roller disco. He probably hates it mainly 
   because he's knocking on a bit and he's worried about his blood pressure.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As a cop, Fabio has a pretty complicated family set-up. He&#146;s 
   divorced, which is usually a given for a cop like him, but his 
   ex-wife was the daughter of gangster Gabrielle Ferzetti, who used the 
   Press to run Testi out of town (although in saying that, they&#146;re 
   on good terms). Fabio&#146;s previously estranged daughter has shown 
   up to hang around his house like a typical teenager, and over the 
   course of the film he ends up dating Laurie, who is the lawyer for 
   the bad guys.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But has why Fabio been allowed to return to Miami after so long? 
   It's all down to a violent gang who are targeting the crime syndicate 
   running the city and massacring them, and only Fabio is mad enough to 
   go up against them. You&#146;ve got your typical tropes here as the 
   D.A. is on Fabio&#146;s case and Fabio has a habit of killing anybody 
   who could lead him to the gang&#146;s leader, much to the D.A.&#146;s 
   umbrage. How is a cop supposed to get his job done while he&#146;s 
   chasing Massimo Vanni around Miami, dodging assassination attempts on 
   his life, badly preventing witnesses from being murdered and playing 
   mind games with his ex-father-in-law?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It might seem at first that this film is just going to drag on and 
   on, but the body count is through the roof and the film is rather 
   violent as the assassinations of the criminal syndicate are rather 
   heavy on the collateral damage. In fact, when two guys burst into a 
   restaurant and try to kill Fabio, they seem to hit everything in the 
   room except him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What I love best about this film is the last twenty-minutes, when 
   Fabio&#146;s daughter gets kidnapped and Fabio goes on the rampage, 
   seemingly killing every crook in Miami in a hail of bullets, or 
   killing them in a hail of bullets while driving heavy plant 
   machinery, or just giving up on hails of bullets and blowing the crap 
   out of everything with dynamite. He evens shoots a guy on fire and 
   another who looked like he was dead already, plus the bad guys get in 
   on the act as one manages to fire off a shot while falling off a tall 
   building to his death. This is all done on a budget of about ten pounds.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That&#146;s not all though &#150; Fabio also has to take on Giovanni 
   Cianfriglia in a middle-aged man mud fight (Cianfriglia&#146;s a 
   little grey around the temples, but still looks rock) and a slow 
   motion scene before the film ends.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   the same five or six characters over and over again. It is truly 
   diabolical, especially considering it was made in 2012.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Everything else about this film is awful too&nbsp; - The 
   voice-acting is an assault on the ears and it just shows you what 
   actors will do for cash spouting lines like this:</FONT></FONT><BR>

    not exactly an expert on Formula 1 racing. All I know is that 
   there's a guy around just now called Lewis Hamilton who always wins 
   these races, because when the COVID crisis started, he was kind 
   enough to lower himself from his celebrity status to show us stinking 
   vermin masses how to wash our hands. I'm glad he did, because if he, 
   and many other famous people who seemingly think that they'll die if 
   people aren't paying attention to them for more than five minutes, 
   hadn't uploaded videos on social media showing us unimportant, 
   irrelevant scum how to wash our hands, I wouldn't have discovered 
   that up until now I've been doing it all wrong. You see, what I 
   thought were my hands turned out to be my knees, and although I know 
   now that I have to use soap and water, I was until recently rubbing 
   my knees in a pool of baboon semen and washing it off using Castrol 
   GTX. Thanks, Lewis Hamilton, Gordon Ramsey, and all those other 
   celebs out there! Thanks for uploading videos of you all showing us 
   how to wash our hands! Can you upload one showing us how to wipe our 
   arses too, please? Because up until now I've been using the hair of 
   that old-age pensioner neighbour of mine.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Having suffered through <B><A HREF="#OneHundredth1981">ONE HUNDREDTH 
   OF A SECOND</A></B>, I know that putting drama into sport is not an 
   easy task, and that opinion is reinforced by this film. It's not as 
   bad as that skiing snore-fest, but it's not exactly as rip-roaring 
   emotional rollercoaster either. It follows the career of one Ken 
   Stark (Brad Harris in non-acting mode), a man determined to win the 
   Grand Prix from the hands of actual real life fast car-driving dude 
   Graham Hill. Stark works for manager Franco Ressel, who has a few 
   other drivers under his wing too. Look, I don't know how racing works 
   at all, so don't bother writing in to point out the technicalities of 
   Formula One. There's some drivers that seem to be all on the one 
   team, including Harris, Ivano Staccioli, and some other guy who likes 
   to bring his wife and kids along for good luck. There's also a rival 
   manager guy whom Ressel pulls smug faces at.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Staccioli has a crash and ends up paralysed, Ressel has him 
   replaced by up-and-coming motorbike driver Valli (Giacomo Agostini, 
   who was a real life motorbike controller pilot. He also does better 
   acting than most of the cast, so kudos to him). Depressingly, whereas 
   I thought I had only <B><A HREF="le_mans_shortcut_to_hell_1970.htm">LE
    MANS, SHORTCUT TO HELL</A></B> to watch after this film with regards 
   to racing-themed films, I notice that Agostini also starred in the 
   musical (!) <B><A HREF="love_formula_2_1970.htm">LOVE FORMULA 2</A></B> 
   and motorbike film <B><A HREF="racing_cars_on_the_asphalt_at_full_speed_1970.htm">RACING

   I guess I'll review that at some point too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Valli is young and ambitious and literally cocky, especially when it 
   comes to Harris' wife. His momma worries about him, but then every 
   driver has someone who worries about them, like that driver who has a 
   wife. He doesn't want to drive anymore, but when Harris convinces him 
   to go back on the road and brave those 'parabolics', the guy ends up 
   looking like overcooked Kofta and Valli gets kicked right out of the 
   team for causing his death, out of the team and straight into the 
   arms of the rival manager, who has a mechanic on his team played by 
   perennial bit-part actor Fulvio Mingozzi! He has more to say in this 
   film than the last ten I've seen him in, and most of it is racing car 
   bollocks. Skidding limit? What the fuck is that? He also has a 
   mega-car for Valli to ride in the last race, but can Valli beat 
   Harris and also beat Graham Hill? You'll have to not bother watching 
   this film to not care about finding out!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Somehow not coma-inducing but by no means any good either, director 
   Guido Malatesta tries to include every trick in the book to keep the 
   viewer's interest, like having us hear the thoughts and worries of 
   the drivers, seeing their day-dreams of victory, and including 
   split-screen flashbacks that you can hardly see on the pan and scan 
   version available online. Those expecting a lot of Graham Hill should 
   expect mostly stock footage of him and some proper footage of the 
   actors trying to talk to him while he looks confused and nervously 
   smiles, like a film crew just snuck onto the racetrack and started 
   filming him. Everyone else (except Ressel, Staccioli and Agostini) 
   just half-arse the film, especially Harris, who arrives home to find 
   Agostini getting it on with his wife only to just stare at them a 
   bit, and then leave, like he's forgotten to get something out of the car.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's been on YouTube since March and only 165 people have watched 
   it, and I guess about 65 of them are me dipping in and out of the 
   film while doing something more interesting. Still, the relentless 
   drive to watch every Italian film ever made will force me to watch 
   all the other films mentioned in this review. Some say I have a 
   choice, but it is a curse. A curse!</FONT></FONT></P>

   comedy horror that is actually entertaining and inventive,</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What drew me in was the cast - Romano Puppo as Frankenstein's 
   monster? Ania Pieroni as a sexy vampire? It's no surprise that Edmund 
   Purdom plays Dracula though, seeing as he always looks like he's 
   allergic to sunlight and likes drinking blood. Ania Pieroni as a sexy 
   vampire? Paul Muller not as a monster unless that monster is the 
   cold-hearted greed of the real estate market? Ania Pieroni as a sexy vampire?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Comedian Paolo Villagio plays forty-year-old-virgin estate agent 
   Fracchia, who has once again messed up selling property at his work. 
   Enraged boss Paul Muller gives him three days to sell a property or 
   he's fired, and his only chance comes in the form of myopic, verging 
   on blind Gigi Reder. He requires a five bedroom property, and luckily 
   Fracchia finds one - located in far off Transylvania. Now all he has 
   to do is pretend to his customer is that everything in the castle is 
   fine and the place isn't inhabited by two terrifying vampire people.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    First off, however, they have to spend the night in the local town, 
   where they meet vampire hunter Kaspar, who tries to warn the dumbass 
   Fracchia about the castle. Fracchia won't listen, and goes back to 
   the local inn with Reder, fending off two attacking rubber bats 
   (Purdom and Pieroni in vampire form) before stupidly passing up a 
   chance to pop his cherry with the innkeeper's daughter. While he's 
   off trying to talk himself into being brave enough to sleep with her, 
   Kaspar uses a machine that fires ultra-violet light beams on Pieroni, 
   but it isn't enough and he gets munched. When Fracchia goes back to 
   the innkeeper's daughter's room, he finds her in the throes of 
   passion with a mysterious stranger, although in reality it's Purdom 
   feeding on her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, Fracchia and Reder head to the castle, where they try 
   and ignore the blind butler (with Fulci-like &quot;<B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">BEYOND</A></B>&quot;
    white eyes) while Fracchia improvises sales talk to cover up the 
   creepiness of the castle - describing the torture room they find as 
   the 'entertainment room' and the crypt as the 'wine cellar', where he 
   also has to try and ignore the butler chopping off servant Boris's 
   hand and adding it to a stew. What is pretty hard to explain are the 
   two coffins containing what appear to be two very dead people, and 
   when the sun sets, these two get up and introduce themselves as Count 
   Dracula and his sister, who takes a liking to Fracchia, which does 
   not please her boyfriend, monster Romano Puppo.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Endlessly stupid and a film that just keeps gathering more momentum 
   in the stupid stakes as it goes on, <B>FRACCHIA VERSUS DRACULA</B> 
   (for me) did contain a lot of laughs and inventive scenes, like 
   Boris's hand constantly detaching itself, Purdom putting on a live 
   performance for Fracchia where his voice randomly changes from male 
   to female in the middle of a song for no reason, and the tennis match 
   between Fracchia and Puppo, where Puppo hits the ball so hard it 
   explodes like a bomb upon impact with the ground. Throw in the 
   bizarre wedding at the end where among the guests are entire zombie 
   horde, Purdom randomly teleporting around the place and the sound on 
   the copy I was watching being replaced by digital static sounds for 
   two minutes and you've got an Italian comedy that's actually good.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This Paolo Villagio fella seems to have made his bread and butter 
   playing a character called Fantozzi in nine films, with this Gigi 
   Reder fella as a sidekick, and in searching for those facts, I see 
   there's another horror comedy in there called <B><A HREF="dr_jekyll_likes_them_hot_1979.htm">DOCTOR

    favourite grumpy gramps is back to sock men in the jaw, scowl at 
   minions and oversee a diamond heist that he's masterminded so 
   perfectly, he feels he doesn't need to even tell people what he's 
   about to do...but still asks them for thirty million lire up front if 
   they want a cut. Strangely, this doesn't work.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Joe's just out of jail and no wonder he's in a bad mood. The only 
   associate he has left is Giampiero Albertini, as everyone else is in 
   jail, dead, or retired. Worse still, his lawyer's gone and misplaced 
   ten million lire Joe gave him before he got sent down. How is a 
   criminal mastermind supposed to pull off the gig of a lifetime with 
   no mates and the arse hanging out of his trousers? Giampiero knows a 
   guy who might help - pimp/gangster Bruno Corazzari and although he 
   has the cash (as evident with his big fancy whorehouse filled with 
   oil paintings, behind which are hatches he uses to watch his 
   customers), he's not going to just hand Joe the cash without an 
   explanation of what Joe is going to do with it. Needless to say Joe 
   leaves empty handed, and grumpy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Joe decides he's too busy to raise the cash himself and therefore 
   delegates this to Giampiero and another sidekick, because he's got to 
   pretend he's gone to Switzerland for cancer treatment to set up an 
   alibi. The sidekick raises five million, but super-gambler Giampiero 
   reckons he can win more in a poker game. It's bad enough when he 
   loses it, but when Corazzari walks in on the game and announces that 
   he owns the club and Gianpiero owes him, Giampiero just about fills 
   his grundies. One kicking later, Corazzari gives Giampiero the thirty 
   million, but only if Giampiero will tell him when the heist takes 
   place. Watch out Giampiero - that's one grumpy boss you've got - 
   better not act so suspicious around old Joe!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Joe's crew consists of the sidekick (driver), a former Olympic gold 
   medal winning marksman turned junky who can only shoot straight when 
   he's full of quality skag, a suicidal actress who doesn't quite know 
   what's going on, Franco Ressel, and some other guy who seems to know 
   chemicals. Giampiero gets sidelined as Joe doesn't trust the way he's 
   looking all shifty and nervous. It takes about an hour for director 
   Guerrini to get to the actual heist, but luckily he fills the screen 
   with all manner of weird and wonderful camera angles and editing 
   coupled with the most unusual soundtrack of screeching electronic 
   tones and what sounds like someone rubbing on a balloon.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Luckily, the pay off that comes in the form of the heist is worth 
   the wait too, as we get sleeping gas, gunfights, car chases, one 
   gangster member getting acid poured onto his face and hands to avoid 
   identification, and a pretty violent, blood splattered gun battle. 
   I'm not sure I understood the motives of the guy at the end mind you, 
   but who cares when Joe Cotten's grumpiness is backed up by such 
   underrated supporting actors as Giampiero Albertini (who always does 
   a great humble and sad), Bruno Corazzari with his steely glare and 
   menace, and Franco Ressel with his sinister arrogance. Director 
   Guerrini also made the brilliant giallo <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#ThirdEye1966">THE

    hell! Who's the intended audience for this crap? I think even serial 
   killer Fred West would have had trouble with certain scenes in this 
   one. In fact, I think in one of his last interviews he said &quot;I 
   liked the bit where they covered that woman in cognac and burned her, 
   but the bit where they showed pictures of a woman eating shit was a 
   bit too far to be honest. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to bury

    I suppose if you're going to make some sort of exploitation film 
   about the Holocaust you might as well go the whole way and make it 
   almost a parody of the horrible events of World War Two. Not that I'm 
   a fan of this kind of film. In fact, even though I've spent four 
   years watching every Italian film possible, the old Nazisploitation 
   films have never been a priority, but then this one showed up on 
   Youtube and as I'm also trying to watch all of the &quot;Video 
   Nasties&quot; on the BBFC list, I had to make the stupid decision to 
   watch it, because I'm not fucking paying for a film like this.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once you're suckered in, you'll find that the plot involves an 
   ex-concentration camp survivor called Lisa helping some Nazi 
   commandant called Conrad escape a death sentence, but just why she 
   does this isn't immediately apparent. Following the trial, the two 
   meet at the abandoned camp, which triggers a flashback that involves 
   all manner of disagreeable crap.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You see, Lisa's taken to some woman-only camp where the girls there 
   are to service resting soldiers from the Eastern front, and to truly 
   cement the tone of this film, a bunch of naked soldiers are shown a 
   series of pornographic slides, like a mother having sex with her 
   daughter and the aforementioned 'woman covered in shit' picture, 
   which triggers a huge orgy/rape scene. I'm not sure I'd be turned on 
   by someone covered in shit in any situation, but then again I'm not German.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's around this point we get introduced to Alma, Conrad's lover, 
   who likes to feed women to her dogs when they are on their period 
   (the women, not the dogs), who also likes to torture the prisoners. 
   When realising that Lisa doesn't seem to suffer under any torture at 
   all, due to her misguided guilt in thinking she was responsible for 
   her family getting sent to the gas chamber, she and Conrad embark on 
   an adventure where they try and push Lisa as far as possible to make 
   her beg for her life. It should be noted here that Alma shoves a whip 
   right up Conrad's arse because he spunks his pants while torturing 
   Lisa, but in the next scene, Conrad is using the whip while 
   addressing the troops. I hope he gave it a rinse first, the dirty bastard.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Full of torture and speeches about how the Reich can just do 
   whatever they want with Jews, including making lampshades out of them 
   and underwear made of hair (did I actually see that?), the film 
   really, truly scrapes the bottom of the Italian exploitation barrel 
   when there's a huge dinner party involving all the Nazis, where the 
   main course is a stew made up of unborn Jew babies. Once again, I 
   must ask who the intended audience for this was, taking into account 
   Italy's allegiance during the war.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's nowhere near as bad as that Godfrey-Ho like, cobbled together

   of the exploding hut kind, and Lucchetti throws in enough nudity and 
   action that made me stick it to the end, like a McDonalds that isn't 
   that great, but you eat it anyway because you need to eat something. 
   That mainly happens in the last third of the film, however, because

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film starts off with a homeless Harrison Muller getting shot in 
   the stomach by some guy who were going to rape some chick, and while 
   he's in hospital it gives him plenty of time to have a flashback back 
   to the Nam, where he was conflicting with another soldier, Slisco 
   (Yes, Cisco would have been easier, but there you go). Slisco (sigh) 
   likes to brandish and threaten other soldiers with a fancy knife that 
   he also likes to torture Vietnamese hookers with. This doesn't go 
   down well with Muller, and the next think the two are fighting and 
   its only the intervention of Major Richard Roundtree that saves the 
   day. Although he might have considered sending the both of them on a 
   secret mission together a bad idea as Slisco heads home without 
   Muller and Muller gets five years in a VC prison for his troubles.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now Roundtree is back because him and FBI agent George Ardisson (who 
   has appeared in all flavours of Italian movies, from gothic horror <B><A HREF="katarsis_1963.htm">KATARSIS</A></B> 
   to piss-take giallo <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#ClapYoureDead1974">CLAP, 
   YOU'RE DEAD</A></B> and even a bit of Mario Merola in <B><A HREF="inmate_1981.htm">THE
    INMATE</A></B> [where Merola reduces a whole prison to tears by 
   singing a song about his momma!]). It seems that not is Slisco up to 
   his old tricks at carving up hookers with weird blades, he's now head 
   of an international drug-running ring. At least he's been keeping 
   himself busy, unlike Muller who we first see sleeping under a bridge. 
   Also, fifteen years have passed but no one's aged a bit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The return of Slisco means that at first Roundtree and Muller have 
   to run around the good ol' US slapping drug dealers around and 
   getting into punch-ups and gun fights, which is all good, healthy 
   stuff. Where the film runs into trouble is when Muller heads off to 
   Vietnam to track down his old buddy, because when Muller starts 
   getting into gun battles in the jungle, it seems that all they've 
   done is film him shooting at stuff off-screen while bits of others 
   films are shown (especially when it comes to stuff that costs money, 
   like huts exploding and stunts). Even worse, it does look like Muller 
   is on location in the Nam (Philipines then), but Roundtree obviously 
   hasn't even left American soil, because he doesn't even appear in the 
   footage with Muller! Instead, he also shoots at stuff off-screen. 
   What can you do when the biggest name in the film can't be bothered 
   appearing alongside the guy who's taking part in the stolen footage 
   sequence? Plus, I swear there's a short shot of Roundtree running 
   through smoke that's been lifted from a Seventies film of his - the 
   stock changes and everything.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Still, there's nudity galore as all parties get involved with naked 
   ladies, and the action is pretty much non-stop, even if it is crap.</FONT></FONT></P>

    a ghostly love story, except it might not be. It's a paranormal 
   horror, or it might be the product of a sick mind. One character even 
   argues that time doesn't exist, which may just be as well, seeing as 
   she's either dead, or alive, in possibly two different forms, until 
   she dies again, but possibly doesn't die at all before appearing in 
   another form.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    <B>GHOST OF LOVE</B> is a horror film directed by a guy who didn't 
   really make horror films (except for <B><A HREF="#AnimaPersa1977">THE 
   FORBIDDEN ROOM</A></B>, which some would argue isn't a horror film), 
   starring a guy who didn't really appear in horror films, with 
   cinematography from Tonino Della Colli and a <A HREF="ghost_of_love_1981.htm#OST">romantic
    soundtrack from Riz Ortolani</A>. Some may find it slow, but for me 
   it was quite unique and rather touching, as well as maintaining a 
   fairly high creepy factor.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcello Mastroianni plays Nino, an accountant trapped in a fairly 
   dull marriage who decides to get the bus to work one day. While 
   minding his business, a decrepit looking woman boards the bus but has 
   trouble finding a 100 lire coin for the fair, so Marcello selflessly 
   gives her a coin, but tries to mainly avoid the sick-looking lady 
   with the bad teeth. Thinking nothing more of the incident, he goes 
   about his business, although the lady promises she will return the 
   money. When he arrives at work, he finds a 100 lire coin on his desk.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Brushing this off, he returns home to banal conversation with his 
   wife and receives a phone call from someone claiming to be the old 
   lady from the bus, who reveals that she is Anna (Romy Schneider), 
   Marcello's long lost love, who broke up with him for no good reason 
   twenty years prior. Marcello is shocked by this sudden turn of 
   events, and the sickly appearance of one who once found so beautiful.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This all sets Marcello off on a nostalgia trip, made worse when he 
   receives a postcard from Anna in the post that was originally sent in 
   1963. Confused, he walks through the misty streets of Pavia until he 
   happens upon Anna's old house, only to startle the landlady. Shortly 
   afterwards he is accosted by the sickly Anna, who forces a kiss on 
   him before running off. In shock, Marcello drops his umbrella and 
   runs off home, only to find a friend of his has just witnessed the 
   throat-slashing murder of the landlady, with an filthy old lady in a 
   white coat as a possible suspect.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It doesn't help that the police find Marcello's umbrella at the 
   scene, but then again the landlady's nephew is the prime suspect and 
   he's run off, so Marcello tries to keep things normal by having lunch 
   with his friends (in a scene that highlights Tonino Della Colli's 
   skills as a cinematographer). It is here that Marcello explains 
   recent events, but then his doctor friend reveals that Anna has been 
   dead for three years, so you can imagine Marcello's surprise when a 
   younger, healthy Anna appears on the scene...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guess the only perfect love is the one that gets away, because 
   Marcello's character tries to find happiness in rekindled love with 
   someone who might have sinister motivations. Or it might all be 
   happening in his head. Director Risi keeps things muddy enough that 
   you can draw your own conclusions, but that doesn't mean the ending 
   of the film is unsatisfying. He's also clever enough to insert enough 
   paranormal stuff to cut through the romance, some of it so subtle you 
   have to be on your toes to spot it. There's the in-your-face horror 
   of Marcello having a seemingly normal conversation with an entity 
   that's just called him out of the blue at some random person's house 
   while said person (a priest trying to keep Marcello out of trouble) 
   cowers in the background asking who Marcello is talking to over and 
   over again, and then there's the blink-and-you'll-miss-it split 
   second shot in the seemingly healthy Anna's home that indicate that 
   things just aren't quite right.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is a film that'll divide opinion, but I liked it. Marcello 
   Mastroianni is subdued here, but he plays Nino with a certain naive 
   innocence, like he himself doesn't quite believe his lost love has 
   come back to him, but he's willing to gamble it all anyway for that 
   one last chance at love. Not much gore except for a neck slashing, 
   but plenty of atmosphere and creepy imagery.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   outline done anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Vanessa starts off as the browbeaten and physically beaten wife of 
   abusive painter Stefano Abbati (from <B><A HREF="#MoroAffair1986">THE 
   MORO </A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="#MoroAffair1986">AFFAIR</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   and <B><A HREF="throne_of_fire_1983.htm">THRONE OF FIRE</A></B>), 
   basically trapped in a huge villa on a Greek island and sporting a 
   haircut so weird I thought she was wearing a Russian hat. Stefano 
   generally treats Vanessa like property, even bringing floozies home 
   to force on her. He does however show some emotion when she seemingly 
   dies in a car crash.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It turns out Vanessa might be smart enough to fake her own death and 
   run off with a small fortune she received in inheritance after her 
   parents died in a car crash (cue giallo-like childhood trauma 
   flashback), but she&#146;s not smart enough to destroy an amazingly 
   large and badly hidden amount of clues that lead Stefano to suss out 
   what&#146;s going on fairly quickly, screentime-wise.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What Vanessa has done was leave Greece and head for the Italian 
   mountain town of Cortina, where she has many happy memories (except 
   for that one about her parents dying). She settles down as characters 
   in these lame-ass plots do &#150; finding new love in boring botanist 
   Marco, and bringing in two lodgers in the form of Mara and Sergio 
   whom she met while they were all having a naked jacuzzi together. 
   Mara seems okay, but Sergio&#146;s a coke sniffer monster who tries 
   to rape Vanessa and gets thrown out accordingly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It only takes about forty minutes screen-time for Stefano to track 
   Vanessa down, so that leaves half the film left to descend into a 
   plot just like those old Umberto Lenzi films from the late sixties, 
   only with a much more soap-opera feel about it. And a terrible soundtrack.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sergio Martino&#146;s cinematographer Giancarlo Ferrando (cheers 
   Fred) does get the visuals right, but the hackneyed, lame plot had me 
   flagging by the fifteen minute mark and suffering by the hour mark. 
   No wonder the genre died out. You gotta push those envelopes, people!</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">I
    suppose when you're in a strange land you can get pretty curious 
   about the locals and surrounding environment, but I don't think I 
   ever witnessed anyone dive head first into the unknown like Nadia 
   Casini does in this film, then again I've also never witnessed 
   someone get bored with that almost instantly and just go off and do 
   something else instead. And then get bored with that too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This atmospheric film starts out with Nadia Casini and her new 
   husband arriving on a Caribbean island. Nadia is young, pretty and 
   spontaneous whereas her husband is old and pot-bellied. He does have 
   a shitload of money though, which is why Nadia married him. In fact, 
   first thing he does is take Nadia out on his yacht, where she sees a 
   mysterious part of the island. Her husband tells her she should never 
   go there, as it is called Black Rock and the locals are scared of it. 
   Nadia then immediately drops the subject because she spies local 
   woman Beryl Cunningham running around a beach with her arse out, 
   making love to some guy in the sand.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Beryl turns out to be a former secretary of Nadia's husband who now 
   works as a teacher. Nadia's interest in piqued as she's been looking 
   for someone to chum about with. There is the guy who works on the 
   yacht and fixes her radio, but all she does with him is ask him about 
   Black Rock, to which he says she probably shouldn't go there as it's 
   dangerous and stuff.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Nadia finally gets to hang out with Beryl, they do all these 
   cool things that friends do when they meet up, like get naked in 
   front of each other, sunbathe topless with each other, take showers 
   in front of each other and even swap clothes with each other. Gaining 
   Beryl's confidence, Nadia confides in her that she doesn't love her 
   husband and is still looking for true love. Beryl says she knows 
   someone that could sort that out for her. Nadia also asks her about 
   Black Rock, and Beryl warns her that the locals shun the place, and 
   that she should leave it alone. So when Beryl falls asleep while 
   sunbathing, the first thing Nadia does is swim over to Black Rock and 
   gets startled when a huge python starts moving towards her. Nadia 
   tells her husband about the incident and also complains that nobody 
   warned her about Black Rock, but he just tells her she's talking crap 
   because there are no snakes on the island.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nadia also gets deeper into local culture when Beryl takes her to 
   see a local witchdoctor in a creepy graveyard who does a quick 
   ceremony where Beryl sees the transparent figure of a white guy she's 
   never seen before and Nadia receives a love potion from the voodoo 
   guy. I couldn't help but notice that even though this guy was very 
   badly crippled and was struggling with two walking sticks, Nadia just 
   kind of stood there and let him walk all the way towards her over 
   rough terrain, which lends more to the idea that maybe the director 
   told Nadia Casini that her character's motivation was that she just 
   never thought about anything, ever.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It isn't long before Nadia's chatted Beryl into taking her to one of 
   those voodoo ceremonies she's seen on television and we get the low 
   point of the film. Rather than go into details I'll just state the 
   phrases &quot;Goat&quot;,&quot;Machete&quot;, &quot;Italian 
   Film&quot;, &quot;Seventies&quot; and &quot;Unnecessary&quot; and 
   we'll just move on to one of the high points of the film, where 
   Beryl, Nadia, and just about every female at the ceremony goes nuts, 
   strips off, and writhes about in the dirt. This pleases the head 
   voodoo lady, and indeed the mysterious guy standing behind her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It turns out the guy is The Snake God and he's taken a liking to 
   Nadia, so he makes the voodoo lady ask her out for him because he's a 
   bit shy and they end up on Black Rock getting it on, so maybe Nadia's 
   found true love after all. Better still for Nadia is her husband 
   dying in a plane crash roughly around the same time so now she's free 
   and single, and has a huge house on a Caribbean island so you can't 
   get better than that then, eh?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Well, Nadia also has an ex-lover called Tony whom she brings over 
   from Rome the day after her husband's funeral. Beryl's all like 
   &quot;Wait - didn't we just bury your husband?&quot; and Nadia's all 
   like &quot;Well Duh! That was YESTERDAY, silly.&quot; So Tony's here 
   to service Nadia, but will the God Serpent be okay with this set up, 
   and why is Tony the guy Beryl saw in her vision? You'll have to watch 
   the film to find out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Strange that such a film plays out like a horror for the first hour, 
   then with the arrival of Tony becomes more of a soap opera. The 
   scenes of the witchdoctor and the voodoo lady are great, moody, 
   atmospheric moments, as is the Serpent God kind of hanging around the 
   fringes of Nadia's reality. There's also a massive amount of nudity 
   in the film too, especially from Casini, who spends about sixty 
   percent of the film naked. She also does that thing we've all done. 
   You know, when you're on holiday somewhere really hot and can't sleep 
   due to the heat, so you get up and rub your arse up and down a wall 
   while groaning erotically.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As well as a lot of nudity, we also get what literally can be termed 
   'Bongo Fury'. These folks pretty much play the bongos all day and all 
   night, no matter what they are doing. That voodoo stuff looks a lot 
   more fun than the Catholic stuff I experienced while growing up. We 
   never had naked woman writhing about in the dirt. We were just told 
   we were all going to hell and to not get too close to the priest.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>THE GOD SERPENT</B> is kind of good if you like pretty looking 
   women and good cinematography, but just be warned it does not go in a 
   direction you'd expect. It looks like Beryl Cunningham also bares her

   television screens at once (one always including the news, and I 
   might be reading too much into it but I swear some of the topics 
   refer to other Petri films, like the mystery disease in <B><A HREF="#TodoModo1976">TODO
    MODO</A></B> and political turmoil in the workplace, as in <B><A HREF="working_class_go_to_heaven_1971.htm">THE
    WORKING CLASS GO TO HEAVEN</A></B>), but it's merely a backdrop as 
   Giannini sinks into a world of misery due to his various hang-ups and 
   his marriage to a frigid wife.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He's surrounded by sex but can't have any, despite even trying it on 
   with a colleague at work, although asking her for advice, dropping 
   his drawers, and asking if his penis is either too big or too small 
   doesn't quite break the ice as well as he expected. At night, instead 
   of paying attention to his wife, he watches television, and as the 
   film goes on the images get more erotic (if a guy giving himself a 
   blowjob is erotic to you, that is). He even tries it on with his 
   wife's cousin on a day out to no avail.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Through all this, and the weird backdrop in which the film is set 
   (which I'll discuss later), a mystery arises. An old friend of his, 
   Gualtiero, makes contact after fifteen years as Giannini is his 'best 
   friend'. Gualtiero thinks people are out to kill him, but somehow, 
   with all conversations involving Giannini's character, talk turns to 
   sex, and Giannini finds out that Gualtiero's wife is a nymphomaniac. 
   Whether this prompts Giannini to help his friend, whom he thinks is 
   mad, is up to you.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The events of the rest of the film roll out surrounding Giannini 
   'helping' Gualtiero and his wife Ada (which leads to the most awkward 
   sex scene I've ever seen in a film), and somehow trying to get 
   through to his wife. Oh, and watching, always watching, those screens.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Rome these characters live in is also very strange. There are 
   constant black-outs. Constant bomb threats at work, which prompts 
   everyone to go down to the park and play football and eat gelati. 
   Everywhere, literally everywhere, is covered in trash, either 
   indicating that there's a lengthy strike going on with the garbage 
   collection or things in general are breaking down. No character acts 
   normal either, as if they've all forgotten how to act normal.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It is a comedy mind you, so there are farcical moments, like 
   Giannini waltzing with Gualtiero, but it's Elio Petri's version of a 
   comedy, so you know it's going to be off-kilter. I wouldn't say it's 
   among his best work, but it's still a good film. It's a pity the 
   version I watched was blurry as hell and fullscreen. However, it IS a 
   great film if you want to learn loads of Italian swear words, because 
   there's a whole scene based around Giannini pondering his use of 
   profanity, so it's &quot;Figa&quot; this and &quot;cazzo&quot; that. 
   Eeh, the language.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   I've since discovered that Elio Petri stated the film was about how, 
   due to the media, people don't actually live life anymore, only 
   living some kind of fake version of life, and that's what the film is 
   about. So there you go</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco">.</FONT></FONT></P>

   and betrayal and the questionable actions of those in authority.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It all starts off like it's going to be really complex too, with the 
   CIA gathering in Rome to discuss a future operation to overthrow 
   rulers in some African country and replace them with US-friendly 
   people. This lot of CIA are led by Tony Musante, an agent on his last 
   chance with his superiors, with sidekick Renzo Palmer in tow. They, 
   and others, are keeping an eye on an African dignitary currently 
   visiting Rome, but then Musante receives news that a rival agent, 
   Lambert, might be meddling with matters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We don't initially see Lambert, but we do see his son and wife 
   watching him drive angrily away following an argument. Later that 
   night, someone sneaks into Lambert's house and takes a high-powered 
   rifle, and we soon see that this person is a (thankfully reserved) 
   John Steiner, who rather nonchalantly heads for a nearby Hilton hotel 
   and calmly guns down a beggar who was pan handling outside. Then he 
   guns down a tourist taking pictures, just to make sure everyone gets 
   the general idea there's a gunman on site.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Steiner also stacks the odds in his favour by taking two hotel 
   patrons hostage, namely famous socialite Claudia Cardinale and her 
   lover, some vain actor guy who for some reason answers the door to 
   Steiner totally naked. The police are soon on site, and after a brief 
   gun battle where a policeman dies, Steiner starts with his first 
   demand - three coffees and twelve boxes of cornflakes. The cornflakes 
   aren't due to some fanatical devotion to cereal, but rather to have 
   an extra crunchy early warning system outside of the hotel room.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After Lambert's rifle bag is found on the roof, the CIA are sucked 
   into proceedings, and Musante finds his superiors breathing down his 
   neck again and Cardinale and Steiner try to outsmart each other, but 
   is Steiner the agent Lambert, and if he isn't, who is he? And where's Lambert?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I love the Eurocrime films of Lenzi, Castellari, Massi etc, but I 
   also love the totally different way Damiano Damiani approaches the 
   genre. His films are more realistic, which makes the sudden outbursts 
   of violence seem more shocking when they finally arrive. This film 
   isn't as graphically violent as <B>I AM AFRAID</B> or his later (and 
   less satisfying but still good) <B><A HREF="warning_1980_giuliano_gemma.htm">THE
    WARNING</A></B>, relying instead on the various attempts made to get 
   to Steiner and the clever ways he keeps outsmarting the cops to carry 
   the film along. His plan to escape is pretty clever - I won't mention 
   who ends up in the room with him, but he makes everyone dress exactly 
   the same, wear motorcycle helmets, and hold guns and identical 
   suitcases in order to confuse snipers.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Guido and Maurizio De Angelis are also old hands at the Eurocrime 
   genre, and give us a mix of electronic and symphonic tunes on the 
   soundtrack. As well as a restrained, charming Steiner, we get good 
   support from Cardinale and Musante, but Renzo Palmer isn't given much 
   to do. Fabrizio Jovine also stands out as the Italian cop having to 
   deal with a crazy American shooting people, and the incredulous 
   machinations of the CIA.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   most gluttonous and over-sexed of all, and while we're talking about

    COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE </A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="cook_the_thief_his_wife_and_her_lover_1989.htm">&amp;</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="cook_the_thief_his_wife_and_her_lover_1989.htm"> 
   HER LOVER</A></B> and <B><A HREF="#Zed2Noughts1985">A ZED AND TWO NOUGHTS</A></B>.
    This must have been a huge influence on Greenaway, as Zed also 
   features Ferreol as a main character, and also has her lying on a 
   gold bed with a mirror above it, between two men. That, the constant 
   displaying of food (or animals in various states, including food), 
   the actors often all contained in one shot, and general feel of the 
   film are very Greenaway-like.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   There's not much of a plot mind you, but more of an exploration of 
   the five main participant characters and their determination to self-destruct
    in the most gluttonous manner. Which brings me back round to my 
   initial question about this film - did Marco Ferreri want to have 
   gallons of shit explode in Marcello Mastroianni's face symbolically 
   or was he just having a laugh?</FONT></FONT></P>

   Director: Augusto Caminito)</FONT></FONT><BR>

   actors: Harvey Keitel! Klaus Kinski! Roberto Bisacco! Debora Caprioglio!</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">What's
    the worst thing you can encounter out on the plains of Africa? It's 
   Klaus Kinski. And what's the worst thing you can encounter out on the 
   permafrost of the Arctic circle? It's also Klaus Kinski. The African 
   tribesman call him Khoe!arga Igaro! Kenangu, which means &quot;The 
   one who looks like his features are trying to slide off the bottom of 
   his face&quot;. and the Inuits have twenty names for him, the most 
   common being Inuvinirnik Takujunga, which translates to &quot;Please 
   put this bag over your head, you're scaring my children&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But what causes Kinski to occupy two separate hemispheres in the 
   same film? Well, for the most part, it's because he's trying to 
   avenge the death of his wife by killing the panther that mauled her, 
   then it's mainly because while he was in jail for hurting some guys 
   who were trying to kill the panther he wanted to kill, the panther 
   died, perhaps of old age. We never find out. What we do know is that 
   Klaus Kinski is really bad at deciding whether or not he wants to 
   kill something. By my count I think he had three separate chances to 
   kill the panther. The first time he just sort of looks at it. The 
   second time he seemingly decides he needs bigger bullets, and the 
   third time he actually frees it from some other guys who were trying 
   to catch the panther.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Apart from dithering about panther killing, Klaus seems to spend a 
   lot of time drinking and staring into space thinking about his dead 
   wife Debora Caprioglio (and no, you don't get to see her 
   jaw-droppingly large assets). He sometimes does this while staring 
   over a waterfall while a tune eerily similar to the theme tune from <B><A HREF="blade_runner_1982.htm">BLADE
    RUNNER</A></B>, although sometimes he just does it while at home, 
   where a strange native woman stares at him and say nothing. Was she 
   meant to be the panther or something? Who knows. The panther also has 
   some spooky POV stuff going on that goes nowhere too. It's great that 
   we're spending so much time with Kinski's character here. I'm just 
   mentioning that for some reason. Also his character's name is Klaus 
   Naginsky. You wonder why they even bothered doing that.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Kinski gets sent to jail for blowing up some other hunters and 
   that's when he's recruited by Roberto Bisacco (from the great <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   and the not-so-great <B><A HREF="rage_within_1969.htm">THE RAGE WITHIN</A></B>).
    He wants Kinski to head up to the Arctic circle and kill a seal 
   hunter who murdered a young guy trying to document how brutal fur 
   trapping is because the police won't do anything about it. Kinski 
   agrees, his bail is paid, and we spend forever watching him staring 
   into space, shaving, showering etc, then he heads off into the 
   tundra, talks to a seal, eats something and then walks off only for a 
   voiceover to tell us that his character vanished and the search was 
   called off after three weeks. So, forty minutes of this film is 
   dedicated to a character who is barely involved in the plot.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I thought Harvey Keitel would have turned out to be the bad guy 
   here, but instead he's Kinski's replacement, so then we get to watch 
   HIM travel all the way to Arctic Circle and set up camp too. Plus, it 
   takes him about five seconds to find Kinski's body (he's under the 
   ice somehow, possibly murdered, but I'm going to sail right past this 
   because it raises so many questions about what happens later). 
   Proving that the title Great Hunters might be a bit optimistic, 
   Keitel gets attacked by the murderer and his mates and left for dead, 
   only to be adopted by an Inuit tribe. So the film turns into <B><A HREF="dances_with_wolves_1990.htm">DANCES
    WITH WOLVES</A></B>, too, I'd imagine as I've not watched that one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film sounds like it's about three hours long, and it feels it 
   too, but it's only one hour forty and I've only described about the 
   first half. Keitel the actor barely even attempts to do any acting at 
   all and genuinely looks totally confused about what he's supposed to 
   be doing, which leads to some funny scenes, especially the bit where 
   he's in an igloo and an Inuit girl is burping his worm under some 
   blankets, only for Keitel to worriedly glance around at an old man 
   who's sitting watching them.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Better still is when Keitel tracks down the bad guy and gives him 
   Rutger Hauer's speech from the end of <B>BLADE RUNNER</B>! He even 
   says &quot;I've seen things you people wouldn't believe&quot; then 
   goes on about seal clubbing and it's cruelty. I'm pretty sure the bad 
   guy would believe him though, seeing as how he was supposed to be a 
   seal clubber. Lucky for us we don't get to see any real seal 
   clubbing, just extremely fake seal clubbing, which was also kind of funny.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This weird empty film ends with even more head-scratching dialogue 
   as Roberto offers Keitel a cigarette to which Keitel replies he quit 
   ages ago, then asks Roberto if he's quit too, even though Roberto 
   pulled a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and offered Keitel one. 
   Things like that happen all through this film. With most of the film 
   concerned with either documenting Kinski or Keitel doing menial tasks 
   or staring at things, a weird <B>BLADE RUNNER</B> fixation, and 
   almost total lack of action, <B>GREAT HUNTERS</B> isn't even about 
   great hunters. Kinski was a terrible hunter and Keitel I guess 
   trained to be a hunter with the Inuits, then went home and never 
   hunted again.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The cinematography was nice though. No wonder this film is obscure.</FONT></FONT></P>

   in this film as it does not follow a linear plot at all for the first

   precisely why the characters on screen are doing what they're doing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    First off, we have a moody-looking Marisa Mell (from other old 
   school Gialli like <B><A HREF="perversion_story_1969.htm">ONE ON TOP 
   OF THE OTHER</A></B> and <B><A HREF="#DevilsRansom1971">THE DEVIL'S RANSOM</A></B>)
    standing on a cliff, staring off into the distance, possibly even

   however, Marisa is gone.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   businessmen like Fernando Rey, all organised by Sylva Koscina (from <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">SO
    SWEET, SO DEAD</A></B>). Without revealing to much of the plot, I'll 
   say that all of these people start complicating everybody else's 
   lives, resulting in people being conned, people being shot, Howard 
   Ross having an outlandish hairdo and a lesbian bath between Marisa 
   and Sylvia. Hooray for lesbian baths and all who sail in them!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    No blood or gore here, just twists and ulterior motives and Marisa

   though, especially during a groovy orgy at the home of playboy type 
   Massimo Serato (from the so-so <B><A HREF="who_killed_the_prosecutor_and_why_1972._italy_ads.htm">WHO

    There's not much else to say about this one without spoiling the

   mobster who drives a WHITE Mercedes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This time around he's not so much getting into trouble via a son or 
   daughter but it's women that are causing him to cry and sing very 
   loudly. Merola's out one day at the Madonna de'llArco near Naples (I 
   looked that up), where pilgrims get blessings by rubbing a huge brass 
   plaque with their napkins. Merola's there with current girlfriend Ria 
   De Simone, a struggling actress, when she meets an old friend of 
   hers, Margherita. Merola's already giving her a bit of the eye while 
   rubbing that shrine, but there's real sparks in the air when he's 
   having lunch with both Ria and Margherita, when the locals urge 
   Merola to grace them with his lovely voice. I'd have been more angry 
   that people where stopping me eating that nice looking half roast 
   chicken on my plate, but for Merola it means he can not-so-subtly 
   hint that Margherita and him might have a future together.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's not just singing and chicken eating that a Guappo has to do of 
   a day, because Merola's got to go around sorting out the community's 
   business, like making sure the theatre company Ria is working for 
   change the script for her, or making sure that nice boy who knocked 
   up that girl does the right thing and marries her. He also slaps a 
   great deal of people, in both aggressive and friendly styles. 
   Eventually though he gets 'round to Margherita and starts wooing her 
   and scaring (slapping) off the competition - a local jeweller with 
   the hots for Margherita. Soon enough all this works and he's giving 
   Ria the old heave-ho, where she has a flashback to when she met 
   Merola. One night, Merola got shot while slapping Sal Borghese, and 
   they fell in love while she tended his wounds. Now he's off and all 
   Ria can do is have a knife stand off with Margherita in public. If 
   there's one thing I learned from this film, it's that every single 
   person in Naples carries a knife.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What Merola doesn't seem to understand is there are two types of 
   women in the world. Those who like watching tiny men getting slapped 
   about, and those who take that as an indicator that the person doing 
   the slapping might be a bit of an asshole. Margherita starts having 
   doubts almost right away, and when he tries acting the big man with 
   her, she's having none of it, and that jeweller is back on the scene 
   - can Mario sing his way out of this one?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Maybe it doesn't matter who directs these. This one is by Stevlio 
   Massi, but it could well have been by Alfonso Brescia and I wouldn't 
   have noticed a difference. Most of the usual traits are here - 
   Naples, food, Merola singing, Merola getting sad, Merola getting 
   angry, everyone talking at full volume. The only things that are 
   missing are two kids pretending to be a married couple and the 
   deafening comedy antics of Luciano Montaldo, who is replace here by 
   staff in a bar who provide the laughs. There's a bit more singing 
   than usual I guess, and for some reason his character is more of a 
   dick than usual.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   cops or criminals, journalists or politicians. It's just about a man 
   who wants to protect his family while all this goes on, but somehow 
   manages to prove he's an asshole in the process. Which I believe I 
   also said about the film <B><A HREF="#DangerousToy1979">A DANGEROUS TOY</A></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Luigi is the stone-faced protagonist here, distant from his wife 
   (Cardinale) and a stranger to his teenage daughter. One night a 
   neighbour alerts police to a break-in happening in their apartment 
   complex and one of the unarmed burglars is shot dead by the police. 
   Thinking that society is breaking down, Luigi seeks to arm himself.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The thing is, Luigi becomes obsessed with the gun and thinks it can 
   solve all his problems, and it also seems to give rise to his less 
   sociable aspects, thinking that a gun will stop his daughter 
   attending hippy parties and taking drugs, or heal the broken marriage 
   between himself and Cardinale. Whereas in <B><A HREF="dangerous_toy_1979.htm">A
    DANGEROUS TOY</A></B>, Nino Manfredi's character is a goofy guy who 
   finds courage weilding a gun and is consumed by it. Luigi was already 
   an asshole and uses the power the gun gives him to exert his asshole 
   personality over others.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It kind of reminded me a bit of the Michael Douglas film <B><A HREF="falling_down_1993.htm">FALLING
    DOWN</A></B>, although not as extreme. Luigi doesn't seem to realise 
   that he's dug his own furrow and although he can't control his 
   aggression, he does regret it. Cardinale does well as the wife who 
   puts up with his crap, even though Luigi doesn't seem to understand 
   there's anything wrong at all.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nicely acted by a small cast, consisting of not much violence but 
   strangely affective, <B>THE GUN</B> is a nice deviation from the 
   usual trodden path, with a good musical score chucked in there too. 
   If I had to compare with <B>A DANGEROUS TOY</B>, I'd say that film is 
   more enjoyable over this, as the guy who plays Luigi (Stefano Satta 
   Flores), doesn't display as much depth as Nino Manfredi.</FONT></FONT></P>

    The plot involves something to do with sex being banned to stop

   that isn't really focused on here, as the bulk involves lead 
   character Massimo being put through various insane situations. Like 
   being strapped to a shagging machine while other students watch, 
   being put through a kind of car wash with a plastic bag on his head,

    Remember sitting through <B><A HREF="it_chapter_two_2019.htm">IT 
   CHAPTER TWO</A></B> and thinking &quot;For fuck's sake! Enough with 
   the jump scares&quot;? Well, you won't get any of that here, as most 
   of the horror is implied or even not implied at all, as we get to 
   live with poor Albrun up in the Alps during what looks like the 
   Fifteenth Century. It's not fun, that's for sure.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film is split into four parts: Shadow, Horn, Blood, and Fire, 
   and tells of four incidents that happen to Albrun and shape her fate. 
   Shadow involves her time as a child, living meagrely up in the 
   mountains with her wizened mother, Pariahs in their community due to 
   their not being Christians, the mother and daughter have little 
   contact with the local villagers, who call them witches and even turn 
   up outside their Alpen shack to threaten them. Life is grim for these 
   too, and about to get grimmer as Albrun's mother gets sick from what 
   looks like either the black death or as some person said on the IMDB, 
   syphillis, which implies that Albrun may be a product of her mother's 
   supposed vocation as a hooker. Don't expect any real answers, 
   however, it's all up to you to interpret what's going on. If you're 
   still awake by the end of it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Albrun is hiding evidence of her first period from her mother, 
   her mother is getting sicker and sicker, until she seemingly gets 
   better, possibly molests Albrun, runs out into the wilderness, eats a 
   goat and dies of exposure. That's the shadow part of the film, but 
   Albrun's mother hangs heavy over the rest of the film, even seemingly 
   calling to her from the darkness of the forest that Albrun is 
   fascinated by. Now, this is what drew me in about this film. There's 
   a lot of scenes of Albrun perturbed by what may or may not be 
   something lurking in the trees, and the film isn't in a hurry to 
   confirm or deny any suspicions. This kind of tapped into the same 
   kind of thing while passing through derelict factory sites and old 
   sewer works as a kid. Those were some spooky places, and the shadows 
   grew long early in the winter which played havoc with your 
   imagination when you were young. This film hit that feeling on the 
   head. Ironically, Stephen King's book 'It' did that too, so it's a 
   shame the films resorted to &quot;LOOK - I'M A BIG SCARY CLOWN oh 
   forget I'll come back later...BOO!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Without discussing the entire plot, adult life isn't the best for 
   Albrun. She has a baby daughter (from where or whom is not 
   explained), is still a pariah, but has made a friend in Swinda. Well, 
   friend at first, but things take a dark turn that pushes Albrun 
   further into either madness or witchcraft, where she seeks revenge on 
   the villagers and explores her own insanity. Very, very slowly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It may get exhausting that every single thing Albrun does or 
   experiences seems to take half an hour, but it was a refreshing 
   approach to horror that I needed at that time and was in the mood 
   for. The last half hour (half hour running time, six hours films 
   time) lets reality slip until you don't know what's real or not and 
   there is some shocking scenes, but I can't impress enough how slow 
   this film is. Definitely one that will divide audiences.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   house-warming party by setting out cheese and wine (and as an

   on the pull, a woman making coffee, a man waking up with a hangover, 
   and even more administration. It was so exciting my brain was 
   literally making me do anything else in order to avoid watching this. 
   I even washed my front door. Who washes their front door, especially 
   in Scotland, where my front door is washed on a daily basis by the

    The story is that a witch and her daughter are seeking eternal life 
   and centuries later they seem to invade the brains of two people - 
   the househunting guy and the shop girl. The house-hunting guy buys a 
   house in which there's some evil well in the basement, and his mind 
   starts going as a voice keeps telling him about eternal life and how 
   he has to give a blood sacrifice in order to obtain said eternal 
   living. The shop girl suffers from similar dreams, hearing the same 
   voice and even dreaming about killing someone and lowering them into 
   the well. Both seek victims, the guy from several bad attempts at 
   seduction at a bar, the girl from her aerobics class.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   scenes though I guess.</FONT></FONT></P>

    The plot eventually gets round to being all about Herc going to save 
   his future bride from Minos, with his sidekick (and much better 
   looking) Mirella D'Angelo by his side. On the way, they encounter 
   bridges and fountains and swords made of rainbows, go to Hell, go 
   into space to drive a chariot around an asteroid belt, grow giant and 
   separate Africa from Europe for Bobby Rhodes while Herc throws a lot 
   of stuff (including himself) into space, like some cosmic fly-tipper.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Add to this stop-motion monsters and ropey cheeseball eighties 
   effects literally every second, seemingly every destination being in 
   space (Minos seems to live in the middle of a fog filled crater on a 
   giant crystal head, up until Herc finds him in the city of Atlantis, 
   which is also seemingly in space), and a near constant pec-flexing by 
   Lou Ferringo, and you've got a near unstoppable juggernaut of 
   greatness that is simply a delight to watch, even if it's sometimes 
   for the wrong reasons. By that I mean scenes where Herc fights the 
   bear, which is scenes from the film Grizzly mixed with Ferringo 
   fighting a guy in a bear suit (I'm not making that up!), which he 
   promptly throws into space. That bit always cracks me up.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   'dirty weekend' scenario now that they've been 'accidentally'

    Samson is the name of this fellow, and it sounds like he has had one 
   'Roid Rage too many, as he's been declared a terrorist by the local 
   Philistine government. Samson sure loves to stand on higher ground 
   and throw spears at people, because he does this a lot to the 
   Philistine army. What he doesn't do is strangle a couple of lions, 
   because Herc does that. I actually typed 'loins' there originally 
   instead of 'lions', because maybe deep down I want to see Herc 
   strangle loins with his bare hands. Or at least a lion (or loin) 
   tamer with a Herc wig on. Plus, I thought I saw Herc strangle only 
   one lion, but then they find another one dead in someone's house (?), 
   so who knows what's happening there.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Philistine King, who seems to think the best way to command 
   troops is to kill some of them, has a scheming evil wife that's 
   always got his ear. I can't remember if it's her that prompts the 
   huge slaughter in the town that happens in the middle of the film, 
   but it's all rather violent, with people being stabbed, hung, and 
   crucified. This makes Samson even more mental than he was before, 
   while Herc and his mates just get captured. Herc does manage to 
   convince the King that he's not Samson, and is sent to get the other 
   muscle-bound moron.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most people when they meet introduce themselves and shake hands, but 
   Herc and Samson do it the man's way - by wrapping huge fucking steel 
   bars around each other. From what I saw Samson was more into it than 
   Herc, but I believe that's because Herc needed something extra going 
   on in there, like 'pulling a train' as it were, with Ulysses in the 
   middle so Herc could donkey punch the little bastard in the back of 
   the head when he was on his vinegar strokes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things pretty much follow the usual plot of these films, but the 
   battle at the end was pretty epic. You'll feel sorry for the 
   Philistine army as their King is firing arrows at them from behind 
   and Herc and Samson are pushing down an entire building on their 
   heads from the front. Herc's parting speech to Samson is pretty funny 
   too, because Samson pretty much looks like he hasn't got a fucking 
   clue what Herc is talking about.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I'm in two minds whether or not to review more sixties Peplum films, 
   because it's not like I'm treating them seriously, is it? Mind you, 
   about eight years ago the security guard of the building I worked in 
   found out that I liked Italian films and told me that him and his 
   schoolmates used to go to the cinema back then and watch the old 
   Peplum films, have a good laugh at them, and throw stuff at the 
   screens, so maybe they were never meant to be taken seriously, eh?</FONT></FONT></P>

   with his own film!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Initially filmed as a comedy, director Marco Ferreri changed his 
   mind about the film and edited it to be more of a drama instead, so 
   what you end up with is something somewhat unique, if not entirely 
   successful, It also kickstarted Carroll Baker's career in Europe, 
   where she notched up, by my count, nine Giallo titles (including the 
   rare <B><A HREF="body_1974.htm">THE BODY</A></B>) and also giving us 
   the great <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BabaYaga1973">BABA YAGA</A></B>,
    putting her up there with Edwidge Fenech as Giallo royalty.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now, the plot of this one will be familiar to those who have watched 
   some of Baker's Giallo films, because <B>HER HAREM</B> is also a film 
   where rich people are holed up in an exotic villa somewhere, playing 
   mind games with each other, but this time, they aren't doing it for 
   inheritance, or blackmail, or murder, they are doing it for love. 
   Isn't that nice? The answer turns out to be no, by the way.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Baker plays the rich Margherita (I can't remember what her job was), 
   who initially wakes up on her wedding day, next to groom Gastone 
   Moschin a rich industrialist/wanker who can't believe his ears when 
   Baker tells him that she doesn't want to get married after all. 
   Moschin pretends to people that he was the one who called off the 
   wedding in a macho attempt to save face, then storms off. Baker is 
   unfazed, and seemingly just goes off to hang around with another 
   lover, lawyer/tosser Gaetano (Renato Salvatori), a reserved mummy's 
   boy type, whom she just teases a bit. Adding to proceedings is the 
   arrival of first love, beatnik/prick William Berger, just returned 
   from Africa with a baby leopard for a pet!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Baker has a bit of complicated love life going on, and regularly 
   confides in her gay friend Michel Le Royer. He suggests that what 
   she's looking for is man with all the best qualities of the three 
   she's been messing around with, but Baker doesn't want that at all - 
   she wouldn't mind just keeping things the way they are - avoiding 
   total commitment and living free. However, they both come up with a 
   plan to get all three suitors in one place, forming a harem, so to 
   speak, where she can have some fun at their expense.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Heading to Dubrovnik, everyone (including the leopard) meets up at 
   one of those villas that crop up in these films, and the head games 
   begin with Baker pretending she called everyone there because she was 
   ill. Everyone reacts differently when it is revealed she's not - from 
   Berger's amusement to Gastone's outrage, which grows as Baker toys 
   further with the 'harem', making them wear signs that proclaim them 
   'immoral', but this backfires somewhat when the three lovers are 
   drawn closer in their anger. This first manifests itself in them 
   pretending to be slaves in a funny scene, but their reactions become 
   darker as the film goes on.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The subversive element to this film is Baker taking on the role of 
   the Casanova type, keeping multiple partners which doesn't sit right 
   with her lovers and probably didn't sit right with the audience 
   either. Moschin even goes on a rant about how it's acceptable for the 
   male to act in such a way, but for a woman it is wrong as they are 
   &quot;physically inferior&quot;. You can see how European audiences 
   would be taken in by Baker the actress. With her hair died raven 
   black, she makes for quite a strong, driven lead, and quite erotic 
   too, in a very subtle way. There's no graphic sex scenes, this being 
   1967, but a lot of scenes are erotically charged. We see Berger 
   taking nude pictures of her from a distance, but the scene that 
   struck me most with Baker is when Berger is kissing her feet, and she 
   stares straight into the camera, a mix of power and pleasure on her face.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Backing up all this stuff is a very strong, colourful cinematography 
   and a cool Ennio Morricone soundtrack that pretty much sums up the 
   tone of the film by pitting a soulful jazz saxophone with those 
   sad-sounding, high-pitched strings he likes to use. Both these 
   elements help the film along, as things get progressively less light 
   and more serious as the film progresses. If anything, this film has 
   brought my attention to director Marco Ferreri, who seems to be quite 
   revered. The only films of his I've ever heard of are <B><A HREF="seed_of_man_1969.htm">THE
    SEED OF MAN</A></B> and <B><A HREF="dillinger_is_dead_1969.htm">DILLINGER

    SEED OF MAN</A></B> to watch, so review soon!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also, if I was Baker I would have just chosen William Berger. 
   Gastone Mochine? It would be like choosing between a diamond and a 
   rotten potato.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Luckily it's an actual antenna the guy is talking about, and this

   seems to be providing Europe with Prince videos and boxing. Peter's 
   the guy's name, and when not fixing signals and talking to kids he's 
   outside playing his drums in the snow or feeding his pet rabbit. 
   While he and Danny are watching a boxing match, Peter somehow 
   stumbles upon a secret channel with a fixed camera and witnesses

   out who committed the murder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Adding as sense of urgency to proceeding is the discovery that what

   know she might be the next victim...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Enough plot, however. This is a giallo in a very loose sense of the 
   word. There's no gory murders and no nudity, but we've got a kid with 
   a childhood trauma, and a musician guy trying to figure out clues 
   using images. The slight problem with this is it's hard to sustain 
   suspense between two people nowhere near a murder, one of which lives 
   on top of a mountain. The director does try his best however, even 
   though everything's a bit tame, and does manage to bring it together 
   in time for the ending. It's a little overlong though.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    One thing I did notice is that actress Isabelle Pasco is one of the 
   least emotive actors I've ever seen. Her expression is completely 
   blank through the film, so I have no idea what her character was 
   thinking at any time. Oh well. Not an essential film, but more of a 
   film you'd use to pass a lazy afternoon or perhaps fool family 
   members into thinking you've gone completely insane, especially if 
   you invite them over to watch it while naked and acting like a 
   screaming chimpanzee with a scat fetish. It worked for me, and now 
   I'm saving a fortune this Christmas!</FONT></FONT></P>

   while drinking beer, like me.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That muddled and confusing first paragraph was supposed to tie in 
   with theme of Elio Petri's second film, where a middle-aged plumber 
   witnesses a man of a similar age die of a heart attack on a bus in 
   Rome. This gives the plumber (played by Salvo Radone) a bit of a 
   wake-up that he could go at any time, so he quits his job and heads 
   out into the world...to find out he doesn't really know what to do 
   with himself.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That just about the plot, as Radone impulsively wanders around Rome 
   trying to find some sort of reason for existing, be it lost loves, 
   his birthplace, begging for cash and even turning to crime at one 
   point, but all carried out in a confused, half-arsed manner, as if 
   deep down he doesn't quite believe he deserves anything more than 
   what he's already got. The whole thing kind of reminded me of George 
   Orwell's &quot;Coming Up For Air&quot;, although Radone's character 
   is much more likeable than the selfish protagonist of that book.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm making it all sound a bit dull, but it's all carried out in that 
   Elio Petri fashion where everything is slightly off, like Radone 
   going to a shanty town and witnessing people burning piles of debris 
   while being interviewed about a tick infestation (symbolism lost on 
   me, by the way - I just enjoy these films, but I don't ever have any 
   great insight into them). There's a visual theme running through the 
   film too of black and white stripes - be it road markings, art, or on 
   the clothing people wear. A reference to the prison Radone is trapped 
   in, no doubt, tied in with a visit to zoo to see the animals in their 
   cages. Maybe I'm wrong. Who knows?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's not top tier Elio Petri but like everything I've seen by him, 
   it's unique and well worth a watch. Elio Petri himself didn't even 
   make it to the age of the character Radone plays in this film - he 
   died at the age of fifty-three. Whether or not he died on a bus, 
   we'll never know.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Giraldi is back in a film that eerily resembles the first film, but

   More Milian running around in his underwear!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This time around he's trying to sort out a car stealing ring (and 
   gaining a girlfriend in the process) and yet again a bunch of petty 
   crooks ripping off a much more serious and deadly crooks which 
   results in many bad guys getting killed and Milian having to adopt 
   many guises in order to get to the bottom of what's going on. My 
   favourite of this is when he tricks the recently widowed girlfriend 
   into bed, but then also convinces her that he can't make it unless 
   she shouts out the names of all her dead boyfriend's mates. This of 
   course results in Milian shouting &quot;What the fuck are you doing 
   talking like that in front of a woman, asshole?&quot; to two guys who 
   interrupt him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Other brain damaging goings on involve Milian's dumb but 
   well-meaning sidekick Massimo Vanni, who isn't very smart but at 
   least is very handy with a gun, which is good because the film 
   doesn't skimp on the usual Eurocrime violence we all expect from 
   these films. That's what is good about these Giraldi films - there's 
   a certain comedic element about it all, but it still delivers. So 
   you'll get to see many a punch up, car chase, and shoot out as well 
   as Milian dancing badly and threatening dorty porvorts.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You also get Milian forcing Bombolo to eat his own shit, and a 
   bizarre detour in the last fifteen minutes when the action switches 
   to New York and Milian romancing a maid. Throughout the film you'll 
   either be charmed by Milian's weird behaviour or just outright hate 
   it. I was entertained.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In fact, the funniest moment here is when Milian goes to New York 
   and when talking to his cop cousin there, they are interuppted by a 
   hobo dressed in what looks like wax paper. This encounter is so 
   random and comes across as so genuine that I thought it was a random 
   moment with a homeless guy they put into the film (Milian even bursts 
   out laughing at one point), but it turns out it was just a great 
   performance by some obscure actor called Taylor Mead. Well done 
   Taylor - you cracked me up.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Visually
    stunning, totally cliched, insanely creative, rather boring, fun and 
   irritating, <B>HOUSE</B> for me was a rather frustrating affair, 
   which is a pity as I'd waited years to see it. I'm glad I didn't pay 
   money for it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's all about a bunch of girls going to a house in the country 
   owned by one of the girls' aunts, and it takes them a long time for 
   them to get there, so I might as well describe them. There's Angel, 
   who is heading to her Aunt's house because she didn't take kindly to 
   her father remarrying after her mother's death, then there's Kung Fu, 
   who does karate, Mac, who is supposed to pass for fat but is 
   literally not fat at all, Prof, who is smart because she wears 
   glasses, Fantasy, who is a day dreamer, and Sweet, who likes to clean 
   things. This lot put women's liberation back about one hundred years 
   in first ten minutes of this film alone. Oh, and they are all school 
   girls, which won't be sitting right later in the film when their 
   clothes start falling off.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eventually, after many shrill conversations, the girls reach the 
   house and are introduced to Aunt, a wheelchair bound sinister woman 
   who continually breaks the fourth wall to let us know that these 
   girls are done for. Then the film breaks down into something I'm not 
   a fan of - people wandering around a haunted house looking for each 
   other and calling out each other's names as they go missing one by one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Right, that's the moaning out of the way - let's concentrate on the 
   good. Every single shot in this film is designed to mangle your 
   brain. Dialogue is almost drowned out by crazy music. The landscapes 
   are artificial looking and surreal. The colours are saturated and in 
   your face. The cinematography is playful and vivid, which goes hand 
   in hand with the crazy effects and editing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Some it was pretty funny too. I watched this with my teenage 
   daughter and wife and we all had a good laugh at various points, but 
   especially when one character was turned into a pile of bananas.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I really did wish I enjoyed this one more. The images and clips I 
   saw of this on the internet made it seem more manic and action packed 
   than it actually was, but that aint the film's fault.</FONT></FONT></P>

    I've watched a lot of horror films and witnessed a lot of strange

    with songs!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Cable TV back in the late nineties used to have a couple of 
   Bollywood channels - Zee TV being the only one I can remember the 
   name of, and when sufficiently stoned and/or drunk enough, it was 
   nice to watch a Bollywood action movie. The cheap action scenes were 
   always a laugh, and the songs were always earnest and charming. This 
   practice kind of fell by the wayside when I started getting into 
   Italian films more (and stopped smoking hash), so it's been twenty 
   years since I watched a Bollywood film. I picked a haunted house film 
   due to me knowing only two words in Hindi, and most haunted house 
   films generally follow the same path.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After a prologue that features a creepy girl scaring the crap out of 
   an artist, a multi-generational family move into a new house. From 
   what I can gather this house was previously own by a relative 
   (perhaps an Uncle), which would explain why there's a tearful 
   middle-aged woman there. Apart from her, the family are made up of 
   the elderly grandad, the mum and dad (who is a doctor), the older son 
   and the young daughter. The haunted house gets to work right away by 
   doing a bit of curtain twitching while the family are outside, then 
   sets its sights on the old man.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    No-one believes the old man when he starts claiming that the mirror 
   in his room if filling up with smoke, so it's a pity later when the 
   replica Mona Lisa picture above his bed starts growing real hair in 
   huge tendrils and strangles the poor fellow. This is written off as a 
   heart attack when the family find him later, but this ghost isn't 
   happy with just one corpse. She wants loads!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While that's happening, there's also a budding romance between the 
   son and a local girl (he saves her from being raped in a badly-stage, 
   funny punch up). This is where the songs in the film come in, as 
   instead of endless scenes of onscreen chemistry, the two love birds 
   have a bit of a song and a dance instead, which I've got to admit is 
   much more entertaining. For the record, the third song features some 
   Mariachi trumpet and a guitar solo for variety.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Love is in the air and scares are in the house as the ghost sets its 
   sights on the kid, making a doll come alive and lure the kid in with 
   some antics before stretching its arms right across the room and 
   trying to strangle the kid. When this doesn't work, the ghost flags 
   down the doctor to help with a sick relative before spending rather a 
   lot of time scaring the crap out of him, tricking him into finding 
   the houses secret creepy bit, and scaring him to death. This also 
   leads to the most confusing and hilarious parts of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For reasons I can't fathom out, the son of the family becomes 
   involved in a chase sequence where he has to track down and attack 
   four guys who are driving a truck. I'm not sure why this happened but 
   it might have something to do with grave-robbing. Who knows, but it 
   does lead to some pretty funny shots as the son somehow manages to 
   catch up with this truck by kind of driving down a hill, running down 
   a hill, and kind of stumbling down a hill, where he fights the guys 
   on the truck, and some pretty lame wirework pulls them into the air 
   and onto the ground. It's hard to describe the disjointed madness of 
   this scene, but it did make me chuckle.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The romance bit leads to a marriage bit which leads to the wife 
   being pregnant for over tenth months, which prompts the family to get 
   a Hindu holy man involved. Things get a bit more urgent when the 
   ghost steals the young kid away to the afterlife, prompting a <B><A HREF="poltergeist_2015.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B>-style
    rescue mission into the houses creepy zone, complete with angry 
   plants, floating kids, and giggling ghosts. I also must admit that 
   both my wife and kids were fucking milling about the place by this 
   point and ruining the atmosphere of the film when they should have 
   been either sleeping or watching whatever it is they show on Netflix 
   (I'm guessing re-runs of Scottish cop show <B><A HREF="taggart_tv_series_1983-2010.htm">TAGGART</A></B>?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Director A.G. Baby seems to know how to keep the right balance 
   between the scares, the songs, and the punch-ups, so what you get 
   here is an extremely low budget horror film that pretty much delivers 
   the goods if you're willing to cut the film a bit of slack. Baby uses 
   a lot of Italian influence here - a lot of gel-lighting, just like 
   Bava and Argento.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>Note:</B> There are two versions on Youtube just now - one is 
   terrible, like trying to watch a film through cataracts, and the 
   other is fine, but ten minutes shorter. None have subtitles, so good luck!</FONT></FONT></P>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">This
    film is so disjointed, cobbled together and forgotten about that no 
   one can even agree on which year it was made. Plus, Renato Polselli 
   has totally pulled a Godfrey Ho on this occasion by taking an old 
   unused horror film called <B>A VIRGIN FOR SATAN</B> and intercutting 
   footage of his own in there, creating a huge pile of crap that at 
   least has some of that old Polselli randomness we've come to expect 
   by now.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The copy of <B>HOUSE OF LOVE</B> that I watched looked like how the 
   world probably looks to an old dog before it finally goes blind, had 
   no subtitles, and seem to have hardcore footage removed from it, so 
   it was pretty hard to follow. It does seem that the film starts off 
   with three young archaeologists out in the field, looking for stuff, 
   when one of them spots two strange men kidnapping a young woman in 
   what looked like a giant net and throwing her in the boot of a car. 
   One guy drives off, but the top-hatted, sinister fellow left behind 
   ominously follows the girl who witnessed the kidnap, seemingly 
   teleporting around the place and intimidating her. Then, he just 
   leaves and our young trio follow.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The trail leads them to a house where various dodgy looking people 
   are arriving, including a woman with a goat on a leash. Through the 
   window, they see the kidnapped girl being forced to take part in some 
   ceremony to praise the demon Astaroth (and apparently have a rubber 
   hand stuffed in her mouth(?)), but when the two girls suggest that 
   they call the police, the archaeologist guy says &quot;bollocks to 
   that - this would make a great news story&quot; and runs off to get 
   some weird equipment to spy on the ceremonies within. I can't 
   remember if this was before or after he interrupted the girl's game 
   of darts(?) to erotically rub a huge tree branch all over one of them 
   while she writhed about sexily. You can kind of understand why I'm 
   having trouble explaining this.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Basically, the footage of the trio comes from Polselli (as if that 
   needed pointing out) and the inside footage is from the old film, 
   which means that our trio spy on everything happening inside and 
   follow people about outside, mainly the guy in the top hat, who 
   disposes of the bodies of the various girls who are kidnapped and 
   used up in the old demonic nonsense going on indoors. There's another 
   sub plot involving a potential victim who escapes the ceremony and 
   goes to the police, but regardless of whether or not that's old or 
   new footage, it's just there to pad out the running time.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For those seeking some of that old Polselli madness, there is the 
   odd thing like another scene of tree based erotic massage and a scene 
   at the end where two men throw live chickens at each other, but this 
   film is mainly dull. Maybe the hardcore bits livened it up a bit, but 
   mostly it involves people spying on some people having a demonic 
   ceremony for almost the whole film. Poor show.</FONT></FONT></P>

   if it prevented me from having to make an effort, would be stretching 
   things by calling this a giallo. I suppose there's a childhood 
   trauma/repressed memory thing going on, and it's definitely sleazy 
   enough, but there's no mystery and no mind games getting played. It's 
   still pretty watchable though.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    First things first though - also on the IMDb, Erika Blanc is listed 
   as playing one of the main characters here, but that's not true. In 
   fact, Erika only appears for about five minutes of screen time. Carla 
   Mancini is listed as playing 'nurse', but that's the only role here I 
   can confirm she's not playing, but she could be one of the asylum 
   inmates though. To be honest, there are about a dozen people here who 
   could have been Carla Mancini.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    <B>THE HOUSE OF RIPE APPLES</B> is kind of a mix of drama and women 
   in prison, but played ultra-seriously. It involves two friends who 
   have grown close because they have spent mutual time together in a 
   mental hospital. First off is Judy, played by Marcella Michelangeli 
   from crappy Eurocrime film <B><A HREF="could_it_happen_here_1977.htm">COULD
    IT HAPPEN HERE?</A></B>, but is listed on the IMDb as playing the 
   other main character, Marsina, who is played by Susanna Levi from the 
   sequel to nothing <B><A HREF="holocaust_2_1980.htm">HOLOCAUST 2</A></B>.
    I can't believe I spent so much time sorting all that out. Judy is 
   basically incarcerated because she's sullying the family name by 
   partying and hanging around with left-wing types, and Marsina is in 
   there because a repressed childhood memory of being raped as a kid 
   keeps trying to break through her mind. It's a buddy movie!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Judy gets released when her slimy, uncaring brother gets her out 
   while also obtaining power of attorney over her, and luckily Marsina 
   has a caring husband who wants her to get better, but it's obvious 
   the Judy is in love with Marsina and Marsina has serious sexual 
   hang-ups. Both of them suffer from a bad case of the flashbacks too, 
   most of them involving sex, and all of the involving body doubles who 
   don't resemble the actresses at all!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things go smoothly for a few seconds before both attend a party 
   hosted by Erika Blanc, which results in Marsina having a flashback/meltdown
    and Judy shaming her family again, so both of them end up in a much 
   harsher asylum, where the nurses are much more brutal. The girls 
   escape, but Marsina's flashbacks result in them being thrown back in 
   there, but the real problems start when the ladies are separated...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Whenever things threaten to turn stale in this film, director Pino 
   Tosini (who has a lot of interesting sounding films that have no 
   reviews and barely any information) throws in some nudity and sex. 
   There's plenty of drama too, as Judy descends into madness in what 
   must be the most badly managed insane asylum in cinema. Marsina 
   herself goes on a personal journey to overcome her bad memories, and 
   unless I missed something, she did this by going to a park and 
   looking at a dog.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The short runtime suggests there might have been porn inserts in 
   this one at some point, but the short run time also meant that I 
   didn't mind spending time watching it. I could have done with less 
   naked male buttock action though. I get enough of that in my part

    The Nazis, being Nazis, just arrest anyone who is a hunchback at

   the German invaders and release the prisoners. He's also got beef 
   with the Chief of the Militia, and while the Chief hunts the

   starting a pretty complicated relationship.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While stealing munitions from a Nazi camp in a very well-constructed 
   action scene, the Hunchback takes a slug to the leg and with the help 
   of a kid, heads to the only place he figures the Germans won't look - 
   the house of the Militia Chief. There, the daughter reluctantly takes 
   care of him, and seemingly forgives him, because they fall in love 
   and she falls pregnant. The Hunchback however proves to be a bit

   Hunchback is a character who wouldn't be amiss in a mid-seventies 
   Umberto Lenzi or Fernando De Leo film, a messed up orphan who grew up 
   learning violence is the answer to everything, and yet he's not a

   could learn that jackhammer editing and overloud music isn't the way 
   to go - sometimes less is more. Look out for notorious director Pier 
   Paolo Pasolini, a man who died in Giallo-like circumstances in real life.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>HUNDRA</B> 
   starts of like its going to be the best fantasy film ever made, as a 
   male-hating tribe of women living peacefully in the woods are 
   attacked by a bunch of female-hating men, sparking a huge, epic, 
   violent battle that lasts for ages as the female tribe prove that 
   they are handy with weapons. They are eventually defeated, but then 
   the tribe's best fighter Hundra shows up and the men chase her by 
   horse for a while before she slaughters the lot of them. Blood 
   spurts, heads roll, everyone's happy. That's the first twenty-minutes 
   of this film. All to a <A HREF="hundra_1983.htm#OST">great Ennio 
   Morricone soundtrack</A>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then the film decides to take it nice and easy for a while as a 
   blind soothsayer tells Hundra that because she's the last of her 
   tribe now she's got to go and get knocked up by one of those pesky 
   men who are causing so much trouble. Hundra must learn how to seduce 
   a man but that's going to be hard as she probably stinks (although 
   she did have a topless horseback wash in the sea I recall), but her 
   main problem is that Hundra's world is populated by flatulent, grimy 
   men who loudly chew chicken and treat women like scum, right up to 
   the King of the land who worships a bull - that's how manly he is! 
   It's like a planet of Fernando Sanchos.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The only guy worth a crap is the town doctor and he's busy hiding 
   the King's son on behalf of one of the King wives or something. 
   Hundra learns how to brush her hair and put make-up on while she 
   teaches them some lady self defence and self respect. Hundra's main 
   problem, save for getting the doctor to give her Irish toothache 
   (that's what we call pregnancy over here), is that the King has 
   promised his macho entourage that he'll make Hundra the barbarian bow 
   before them. It's around this point that you realise that the film 
   your watching doesn't have much of a story.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After some light-hearted moments that don't quite sit right with the 
   rape and violence, Hundra finally unleashes her girly rage on a bunch 
   of sweaty-arsed morons in a battle that is so awesome, the entire 
   thing takes place in slow motion! For about ten minutes!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    So in the end <B>HUNDRA</B> ends up kind of good and kind of bad, 
   what with the pacing problems in the middle. I have to admit I 
   enjoyed it more the second time around, and Laurene Landon is pretty 
   watchable. We asked some online people what they thought of the 
   themes of this film, and almost immediately received several thousand 
   of demented replies from people we'd never met. Here's a couple of

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Now,
    we all know that in Gothic horror being dead is like having the 
   common cold, and that after a few days you can just shrug it off and 
   go back to that old draughty castle you live in, but this film takes 
   that to the extreme. Nominally a scary story about revenge from 
   beyond the grave, <B>IN AN OLD MANOR HOUSE</B> also covers the 
   dynamics of the family, the class system, failed ambition, parenthood 
   and probably a lot of other stuff that went right over my head.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film entirely takes place in our around a run-down Manor House 
   where an aging businessman runs his empire. Anastazja, his second 
   wife, is much younger and has the hots for her stepson Jerzy, upon 
   whom the film mainly focuses on. The old man has two daughters by 
   Anastazja too, who mainly live in their own little world, giggling at 
   everything, including the fact that Jerzy is in the woods somewhere 
   with his head jammed between Anastazja ample fat rascals.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The old man (whose name I wish I'd taken note of), shoots Anastazja, 
   and weirdly there doesn't seem to be any consequences to this, which 
   is perhaps a dig at the upper classes getting away with murder. He 
   settles down for a new life by sending for his cousin Aneta, who has 
   recently become widowed herself and has fond childhood memories of 
   hanging around with Jerzy. Jerzy on the other hand is a mess. He was 
   already a failed artist and poet, and his main inspiration is now 
   dead...for a wee while.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At this point in the film I wasn't sure what to expect, as I 
   randomly chose to watch this film on the Movies For Nothing channel 
   on YouTube (be quick - the films are starting to get deleted), so 
   when Anastazja appeared during a dinner party and sat herself down 
   like nothing had happened, the film took a sudden left turn into the 
   weird, and got weirder as it went on. Anastazja admits she was dead, 
   and even met Aneta's husband, but now she's back, seemingly to avenge 
   herself on the old man and Jerzy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Another strange aspect of the film is how everyone just kind of 
   accepts Anastazja is back and tries to work around it, as she reveals 
   she didn't love Jerzy but was in love with the old man's most 
   cherished employee. Jerzy is the most needy character, emotionally, 
   and instead of falling back in with Anastazja, she persuades him to 
   go after Aneta, while she convinces her two daughters to drink 
   cyanide. This is made even more surreal by the kids dancing around 
   while a narrator sings a song about how they will shortly die...for a 
   day or so.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things pretty much carry on in this fashion, with Anastazja taking 
   her revenge on various people and killing them (slightly) while Jerzy 
   falls in love with Aneta, who is then revealed to have a lover. 
   Everyone kind of knows that Anastazja is the main problem, and Jerzy 
   comes to the conclusion he has to kill her again, but how do you kill 
   someone who just keeps coming back? Things get even stranger as Jerzy 
   shoots Anastazja out in the woods, and as she falls to the ground 
   dead someone else digs themselves out of the ground, only to be 
   revealed as Jerzy's hitherto unknown son! This too is accepted 
   without much contest from everyone in the household...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's obviously some sort of piss-take, this film, and a swipe at the 
   rich, but there's still a lot of horror elements in there too, mainly 
   from Anastazja and the use of mirrors throughout the film. Anastazja 
   often appears reflected in them to talk to Jerzy, who paints over one 
   at some point. Even the mysterious son using one to direct sunlight 
   about a room he's sitting in. In fact, as the film progresses 
   Anastazja becomes more and more sinister. Luring a drunk guy to his 
   death while standing on water, walking out of a painting to speak to 
   Jerzy, sitting silently with her two dead children. It's quite effective.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    An interesting film, this one. Maybe a little talky, but as an 
   Eighties gothic horror which is also some sort of social commentary, 
   it worked for me.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Answer
    at the end of the review.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When she's suddenly raped by her father (Fulvio Mingozzi), Finnish 
   girl Ingrid (Janet Agren) high tails it out of there and heads for 
   Italy on what must be a particularly long train journey. On the way 
   there, she discards her knickers and declares that she'll never wear 
   any ever again, deciding to become a prostitute. She's rather 
   proactive in this decision, taking on two separate customers on the 
   way to Rome. For the record we do see her wearing underwear later in 
   the film, but then we all make promises to ourselves that we break, right?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>INGRID ON THE STREET</B> starts off like a light-hearted, almost 
   arthouse depiction of a girl getting into prostitution, as Ingrid 
   quickly makes a friend in Claudia, who takes her under her wing. 
   Claudia is loud and shrill but good hearted, and nowhere near as loud 
   and shrill as a character we'll meet later in the film. She also 
   lives with eccentric artist Bruno Corazzari, who paints gory pictures 
   with bleeding dolls stuck to them. Ingrid is entering an uncertain 
   world where everything is borderline surreal, including some of her customers.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    She doesn't have much luck at first (Claudia says she's too perfect 
   looking), but then a customer picks both her and Claudia up and takes 
   them home. The customer is Enrico Salerno, a charming, humble old man 
   who sets them both up in his living room, showing them pictures of 
   his ancestors and giving them antique clothes to wear, but then the 
   girls realise that there's a seance going on next door that they seem 
   to be indirectly involved in, and that there's an apparition 
   appearing at one end of the room!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This off-kilter tone remains in place for the entire film, but the 
   mood of the film changes dramatically in the second half, with the 
   appearance of Claudia's pimp, Franco Citti. Not only is Franco smug 
   and arrogant, he's also psychotic and leads a group of neo-Nazi 
   bikers with him everywhere he goes, who kiss his feet and treat him 
   almost religiously. This includes henchman Franco Garafolo. If you 
   shoved Franco Citti and Klaus Kinski into one of those teleporters in 
   Cronenberg's <B><A HREF="fly_1986.htm">THE FLY</A></B> and mixed 
   their DNA, Franco Garafolo would be what crawled out of the other teleporter.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Claudia is subservient to the mad Citti, but Ingrid hates him on 
   sight and sets up the rest of the film, where the two have a 
   tit-for-tat grudge with each other that leads to rape, drugs, murder, 
   church-organ playing, and Franco Citti yelling and screaming and 
   chewing the scenery. He maybe could have learned a thing from Salerno 
   or Corazzari, who both play eccentric characters in a very restrained fashion.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film isn't exactly sunshine or rainbows, and certainly a bit 
   bi-polar in tone, but the weird set design (including tunnels full of 
   stolen loot and that old Seventies staple, the mannequin), the odd 
   set-pieces and the sudden exploitative violence make it an 
   interesting watch, but not something you'd watch more than once.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The answer of course to the multiple choice question is <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">C</FONT></B>,
    although I may add that Rossi probably did have his hair pulled out 
   for real, used real shit in the bowl, and really had his tongue cut 
   out. That's dedication to your chosen craft!</FONT></FONT></P>

    OF THE TITANIC</A></B> (1999; where a giant octopus threw an iceberg 
   at the Titanic, but then saved everyone on board through guilt), our 
   loving couple Elizabeth and Don Juan, plus their talking dog Smile, 
   plus the two rats from the first one, all descend in a bathysphere to 
   find the sunken ship. Unfortunately, there's a bunch of gangster 
   sharks down there who are in cahoots with the bad guy from the first 
   film who make the vessel sink to the bottom of the ocean. But not 
   before hurting the viewer bad with a rapping shark song.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The giant octopus from the first one then arrives to save them but 
   can't, so it's down to the folks of Atlantis to help the 
   humans/dog/rats. This is where the film starts getting weird, as 
   everyone is taken to Atlantis, which is ruled by a king with no face 
   who has a throne with a big face on it that follows him around and a 
   group of counsellors made up of a red dolphin, some sort of hybrid of 
   a sting ray and an otter, and something that looks like Zebedee from 
   the Magic Roundabout, only like a fish and also gay, and if you think 
   I'm just saying that, you should see the musical number and many 
   outfit changes this character goes through.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also inhabiting Atlantis are a bunch of living toys that share a big 
   room and join Zebedee in a musical number that made my mind try and 
   break free from its moorings before blurting out that our heroes are 
   trapped in Atlantis forever, which they take very well before the 
   plot lurches onto some sort of rebellion happening involving rats 
   (one of which sounds like Fu Manchu), the sharks from the start of 
   the film, and the bad guy from the last film. Before you know it 
   there's a huge battle where no one gets hurt.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This badly animated seemingly made-up-on-the-spot crap is good for a 
   laugh once the film stops making any sense at all, especially the 
   hilarious looking walking throne which the King magics across the 
   room for no real reason. It attracts a lot of hate on the IMDB, as it 
   'disrespects those who died in the Titanic', making me wonder what 
   these people would feel if they watched any of Italy's 
   Nazisploitation films.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Plus, one person points out the goof that cannonballs won't fire 
   underwater as the gunpowder would get wet. Really? They're okay with 
   the talking animals, the octopus that acts like it needs a full-time 
   carer, the talking screwdriver that appears out of nowhere, the 
   praying mantis the size of the Titanic, the disturbing scene with the 
   rats in an asylum, the squelching noises the king makes as he walks 
   about underwater, the conveyer built pavement system in Atlantis, the 
   Scottish artillery guy dressed in drag, but has to point out that 
   tiny scientific fact that got looked over? What a fanny.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   him killed so he can't blame Andrea for killing that guy back then. 
   Too complicated if you ask me, seeing that Andrea just flat out kills

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film involves a group of people travelling to the Vatican to 
   meet the Pope, this group representing what in the director's mind 
   must be a contemporary slice of Italy's Years of Lead: Some priests, 
   some industrialists, some nuns, a journalist (a film critic no less), 
   a nuclear family, and a Marxist. They come bearing gifts for the Pope 
   - bespoke Eucharist, fancy wine, and other superfluous crap. What 
   none of them are expecting is that the clinical elevator they have 
   just embarked on will endlessly ascend to the heavens, causing 
   everyone aboard to revert to their primitive urges and discard the 
   ersatz vestiges of modern society to satisfy their base instincts.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Panic sets in rather quickly, and our captives desperately try to 
   find a way to escape the elevator, via the door and the roof, but to 
   no avail. Desperation comes next, and I must point out that the 
   entire film's soundtrack is set to the Vatican Cable Radio that plays 
   endlessly into the confined space (including some no doubt illegally 
   acquired Frank Zappa, namely the George Duke performances from 'Eat 
   That Question' and 'Blessed Relief').</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One person decides to go insane early and tries to strangle a nun, 
   resulting in him being bludgeoned by what my hazy Catholic upbringing 
   tells me what might be some sort of tabernacle. This is just the 
   beginning of the horror, as everyone involved languishes in the 
   endless purgatory, one priest gets the idea to hump the young girl 
   that's been brought along. While everyone is sleeping, the film 
   spends a rather uncomfortable amount of time showing this priest 
   giving the girl a bit of a toe-job while also trying to knock one 
   out, and credit where credit is due, I quote user Lazarillo from the 
   IMDb when he comments &quot;Of course, this scene is totally 
   preposterous (after all, there is also a teenage BOY on the elevator 
   that the priest could have molested).&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eventually things descend into the scatological and anthropophagic 
   when the group start eating themselves and their waste, which reminds 
   one of the film <B><A HREF="salo_or_the_120_days_of_sodom_1975.htm">SALO</A></B> 
   (of which my mother will not allow me to watch, and I always listen

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The problem with this film is that it could mean anything. Is the 
   message of the film that you have to go through hell to get to 
   heaven? Is it that those who seek a higher level of existence must 
   first experience life's lowest points? Or that those who pretend to 
   be most pious are those who are most morally corrupt? Or perhaps that 
   the Papacy are in reality untouchable and unobtainable, and the very 
   notion of penetrating their social sphere is an impossibility, and 
   that there really exists a them and us society, where a world of 
   wealth and leisure are basically beyond our reach, and our attempts 
   to reach it are like some sort of purgatory?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Questions, and question marks. That is all we have. Punctuation, and

   There are foxes fighting over territory outside my window. I believe

    Girotti turns his powerful peepers on the corrupt and the Mafia in 
   this film that might be made in the Forties, but still packs a punch 
   thanks to a dense plot, gritty atmosphere, and the weird backdrop of 
   rural Sicily, which always struck me as Italy's stranger, but 
   extremely violent little brother.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film hits the ground running when a man is robbed of his mules 
   by two masked men, one of whom is forced to kill their victim after 
   he pulls his mask off. Giving the guy two shotgun blasts to the chest 
   (of which we see the aftermath), the two men run off with the mules. 
   These mules however belong to a local Baron (Camillo Mastrocinque, 
   actor turned director of <B><A HREF="angel_for_satan_1966.htm">AN 
   ANGEL FOR SATAN</A></B> and <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CryptOfVampire1964">CRYPT
    OF HORROR</A></B>) and he's not too happy, mumbling about how the 
   Mafia are failing in protecting his assets. The two Mafia foot 
   soldiers standing right in front of him when he says that gently 
   remind him to shut the fuck up, and reassure him that justice will be served.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Later that day, new Judge Massimo Girotti arrives by train, only to 
   be met by his predecessor, who is waiting to leave. This guy 
   instantly recognises Massimo and tells him the best thing he could do 
   is turn around and go back home on the train. Massimo asks why but 
   the guy just laughs and leaves, and Massimo heads into town to find a 
   very warm welcome from lawyers, and the mayor, and the head of the 
   local police. Only the policeman seems sincere, however, as even his 
   new landlord seems to be hiding behind a false smile. This is where 
   the atmosphere of the film comes into play, because where Massimo 
   goes, the entire town seem to be watching and judging him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The town's problems are manifold; there's a guy lying in the 
   doctor's house with a shotgun wound to the chest, there are scores of 
   court cases lying unresolved in Massimo's new office, the mine that 
   provided the town jobs is closed for mysterious reasons, and most 
   town officials are subtly hinting that perhaps Massimo would be best 
   just putting his feet up in his office and just relaxing. However, 
   Massimo is young and just and earnest, and wants to clean things up 
   using the law of the state, but he's soon to find out that there's 
   another law in Sicily.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The guy who's been shot won't name the guy who did it, but he's one 
   of the mule thieves and the other guy is on the run. The guy who shot 
   him is a real sinister bastard out to deflower his girlfriend's 
   daughter, and the girlfriend is all up for that if she gets the 
   financial security he promises! Complicating things further is the 
   daughter's boyfriend, a young kid who befriends Massimo, who gets 
   caught up in all this later on in the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the meantime, he's looking into the mine business and finds it is 
   owned by the Baron. While out inspecting the place, the Baron refers 
   to him having friends everywhere, and that prompts the appearance of 
   the Mafia, led by Don Massuro. Massuro is diplomatic and friendly, 
   and when Massimo subtly hints that he's out to help those in need 
   using state law, Massuro gently reminds him that out in the sticks, 
   folks adhere to a different and more ancient law. Massimo then 
   insults Massuro with his insolence, causing a disturbance in the 
   general order of things.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And that's pretty much what he keeps doing throughout the film, as 
   he meets various people and becomes embroiled in psychological 
   battles with them, as the more malicious side hide behind veiled 
   threats and Massimo glares at them and simply states the truth. The 
   true villain of the film is the Baron, who has a lot of corruption he 
   doesn't want uncovered, whereas Massuro, despite the many folk who 
   receive shotgun blasts to the chest on his behalf, is very 
   approachable and honourable, and likes Massimo as he reminds him of 
   his son, who has followed a more legal path in the life. This 
   humanity actually makes the Mafia Don very likeable.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, the film lies on Massimo Girotti's shoulders. From the 
   outset he proves he's above bribery and threats, putting his life on 
   the line for his belief in the law, so much so that he rants at the 
   entire town and the Mafia in the end, calling their way of life 
   cowardly. His steady gaze and bottled rage is something to behold, 
   and this might be the best I've ever seen the actor. Simply 
   mesmerizing, and though people have put down the romantic sub plot of 
   this one, I think it was thrown in there to show his character did 
   have a softer side.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So, if you want to see a seventy year old film where a guy murders a 
   woman with a sword and there's a sub plot about trying to take a 
   sixteen year old's virginity, this is your film! It could have easily 
   been made in the Seventies, although I'd imagine the ending would 
   have been grimmer.</FONT></FONT></P>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">I
    sought this one out because <A HREF="invisible_woman_1969.htm#OST">Ennio
    Morricone's soundtrack</A> is absolutely gorgeous and I wanted to 
   see if the film lived up to the music. Now I'm not sure if I liked 
   this one because the soundtrack is so good, or if the film itself was 
   genuinely good. Eh, I'm not making myself clear here.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You see, a lot of the film involves Giovanna Ralli looking sad and 
   staring off into space while the soundtrack plays, and we all know 
   that Morricone's music works best when its got plenty of time to move 
   around and develop. Director Paolo Spinola seems to understand that 
   here, and in having a film where there's not much plot anyway, he 
   just lets the music and the visuals fill in the gaps. This, however, 
   some may perceive as being boring.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giovanni Ralli (the cop from <B><A HREF="what_have_they_done_to_your_daughters_1974.htm">WHAT
    HAVE THEY DONE</A><A HREF="what_have_they_done_to_your_daughters_1974_arrow_video_blu-ray.htm"> 
   TO YOUR DAUGHTERS?</A></B>) is having a bit of a hard time. It seems 
   that her academic husband Silvano Tranquilli has become so bored of 
   her that he doesn't notice she's there anymore. At one point, he can 
   even see right through her to a stain on the wall she should be 
   obscuring. Ralli's not coping very well with this at all, and begins 
   to think that Silvano might be cheating on her, especially with the 
   free-living Delfina. I'm not sure why or who in particular she was, 
   but Delfina was always hanging around with Silvano and Giovanni, and 
   regularly flirts with both.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Despite painting half her head white and sitting directly in front 
   of him, it seems Silvano literally at times cannot see Giovanna, 
   although in saying that he does take notice of her when he walks in 
   on Delfina seemingly just about to put the moves on her. His 
   negligence even goes so far that he doesn't even believe her when she 
   admits to sleeping with a young socialist student who is the polar 
   opposite of Silvano's character.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This leads me to another aspect of the film that I found interesting 
   - Giovanna's rather tenuous grasp on reality. Often throughout the 
   film we see what she sees, and what Giovanna sees isn't always 
   actually happening. At the opera she sees Silvano groping her friend 
   Anita, and later is really upset to find Silvano in Delfina's room, 
   both of them in the buff. This greatly upsets her (and leads to yet 
   more shots of Giovanna Ralli's huge hazel eyes staring off into space 
   while the soundtrack plays), and yet, when she returns to her room, 
   she finds Silvano fast asleep.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guess that kind of leaves the events of the last half hour of the 
   film ambiguous, and I'm still not sure what to make of the ending 
   (was Giovanna even real? Was she the ghost of an ex-wife Silvano was 
   trying to forget? Who knows). Best to seek it out for yourself. At 
   the least you'll get to enjoy Morricone's soundtracks, which is as 
   haunted and lonely sounding as Giovanna herself. Breathy, wordless 
   female vocals, sad strings, minimal percussion. Very good indeed. If 
   you want to skip the film the entire soundtrack is on YouTube anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also, no one smokes like Silvano Tranquilli. So suave!</FONT></FONT></P>

    Ela, on the other hand, takes at least an hour of the film's running

   from another tribe's chief, William Berger, that violence isn't the 
   way forward and that man will continue to suffer if he doesn't give 
   up his violent ways. Then Berger suffers as someone violently kills him.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    What can one do when one is facing an enemy with superior weapons? 
   That's right - invent a weapon more superior than that superior 
   weapon. You know where this is all heading, right? Director Lenzi 
   plays the whole thing deadly straight, with very little cheese, and 
   seems to be making some sort of statement about man inevitably 
   heading towards doom due to his creativity when it comes to dreaming 
   up ways to kill his fellow man. He also seems to completely miss the 
   irony in making a film against violence while killing a boar at the 
   start of the film. What the fuck does Umberto Lenzi have against animals?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    the film is neither crap enough or crazy enough to be tagged a

    no! Some asshole has murdered Brigitte Skay's rich mother and father 
   and stolen all their land and cool stuff and now Brigitte has to go 
   and live with the gypsies. Years later, Brigitte swears revenge on 
   the Van Nutter family and decides to kill the lot of them. To make 
   things more challenging, Brigitte has decided to do this while 
   wearing as little clothing as possible. It's like <B><A HREF="shogun_assassin_1980.htm">SHOGUN

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's good that Bruno Corbucci, director of eleven Inspector Giraldi 
   films starring Tomas Milian ( I've only watched <A HREF="cop_in_blue_jeans_1976.htm">the</A> <A HREF="hit_squad_1976.htm">first</A> <A HREF="swindle_1977.htm">three</A>),
    woke up one day and realised that the swashbuckler genre has a lot 
   of dull spots, and the solution to those dull spots was to fill them 
   with as much female nudity as he can muster. That means, between the 
   nifty sword fighting sequences, and sometimes during the nifty 
   swordfighting sequences, there's always a pair of jelly water mangoes 
   bouncing around the place.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Brigitte may have been brought up by gypsies (including Sal Borgese 
   in hyperactive mode), but she hasn't forgotten the nasty land grab by 
   the Van Nutter dynasty. They haven't forgotten either, so when she 
   re-emerges into society, they immediately send a lesbian assassin out 
   there to murder her, so you get nudie love scenes between Brigitte 
   and some other lady that ends in a killing by Brigitte, who has 
   serious sexual hang-ups due to witnessing her parents being murdered. 
   Well, that and every guy in the film trying to force themselves on 
   her, including squint-eyed actor Enzo Andronico, who gets a blade to 
   the guts for his trouble.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I've got to admit that there's a certain satisfaction to watching 
   Brigitte wipe the smug smile of the evil dictator's faces when she stabs/disfigures
    the lot of them while usually being topless, a state which she also 
   seems perpetually caught in during the film <B><A HREF="blackmail_1974.htm">BLACKMAIL</A></B> 
   (which features no blackmail). It's certainly a device that keeps you 
   awake during the non-violent parts of the film, as well as all the 
   other ladies who get naked during the course of the film. In fact, 
   there's plenty of sleaze here as scenes involve slaves who face death 
   if they become aroused in front of crowd, and the bad guy's wife who 
   tries to convince her man she's a bit dirty by possibly taking it up 
   the wrong 'un.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's even a bit of gore thrown in at the end and a couple of 
   twists. For those repelled by the thought of watching an Italian 
   swashbuckler, this one is worth the watch. It's the perfect match of 
   history and sleaze. Poor Brigitte Skay died back in 2012 and I've 
   seen several references to her being a dumb ass, but very little 
   evidence. That's a strange assumption to make about someone, and if 
   anyone's got evidence, send it to me.</FONT></FONT></P>

   that's remotely true. What the hell, eh?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Those hoping for a kind of 'missing link' Italian zombie 
   comedy/horror crossover film will be disappointed to find out that 
   this film contains absolutely no gore whatsoever. The zombies are 
   properly undead people, but they just look a bit pale and walk like 
   zombies, and have a craving for human flesh which will pretty much 
   fuel the entire plot of the film...until the zombies discover they 
   don't actually have to eat human flesh. But don't worry about that 
   turn of events because even stupider things happen later in the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It all starts when gravedigger Renzo Montagnani witnesses a road 
   accident involving two Fiat drivers and a cyclist just trying to have 
   a casual piss at the side of the road. Renzo ends up in the same room 
   as the three corpses while reading aloud a book called &quot;Revenge 
   of the Zombies&quot;. Little does he know that when he reads out the 
   voodoo ceremony from the book, he unwittingly resurrects the trio 
   lying in coffins behind him, and when they come to life, he instantly 
   dies of a heart attack. Luckily though the trio of undead read out 
   the voodoo ceremony again and Renzo finds himself part of a comedy 
   zombie quartet who are pretty much the Three Stooges with a craving 
   for human flesh. Or at least they crave flesh because the book told 
   them that's what they need to eat.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's not much character development to be had, but apart from 
   Renzo you've got Daniele Vargas from the giallo spoof <B><A HREF="terror_with_cross-eyes_1972.htm">THE
    TERROR WITH CROSS</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="terror_with_cross-eyes_1972.htm">-</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="terror_with_cross-eyes_1972.htm">EYES</A></B> 
   (there's a copy on YouTube of that, so I'll probably review that if I 
   can get over the fact that the copy there looks like I've instantly 
   developed cataracts), the cyclist guy, and a guy who kind of looks 
   like Dean Stockwell in <B><A HREF="blue_velvet_1986.htm">BLUE VELVET</A></B>.
    These four shortly figure out they are pretty shit at ambushing 
   humans at the roadside, so it's lucky that cyclist guy's Aunt owns a 
   hotel and instantly dies of a heart attack when she discovers her 
   nephew is still alive. Shortly afterwards, the four set up shop in 
   the hotel and most of the film details their attempts to eat the 
   guests, which always goes wrong.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    First there's a very sick man that they all salivate over, then 
   there's the family that consist of a hen-pecked husband, nagging 
   wife, and evil, pranking son who carries a picture of Hitler around 
   with him and constantly trips up the zombies. I've got to say that 
   things kind of level out about this point in the film what with the 
   overwhelming constant slapstick comedy, but luckily Nadia Cassini 
   turns up and interest is once more piqued.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nadia's travelling companion is a shady criminal guy and he's shady 
   because he's Nadia's lover and he's just killed her husband. The 
   zombies are over the moon by this because it means there's a corpse 
   they can chow down on without any hassle and to make things even 
   better Nadia is a bit of a nymphomaniac, so when zombie tries to bite 
   her, she thinks he's coming on to her and the guy gets the green 
   light for a bit of the old boffing. It's a pity the kid ruins 
   everything by stealing the zombie book and bringing her husband back 
   to life.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I suppose it doesn't ruin anything for the audience as we still get 
   to see Nadia perform a zombie striptease which is the highlight of 
   the film. The thing to keep in mind is that it doesn't matter which 
   genre the film exists in, be it horror, Eurocrime, sex comedy, 
   sci-fi, whatever, the main aim of any Italian film between the late 
   sixties and mid-nineties is to show some naked lady action. Even the 
   kids cartoon <B><A HREF="winx_club_animated_tv_series_2004-2019.htm">WINX
    CLUB</A></B> sailed close to the wind what with the short skirts and 
   the dirty old wizards praying on the fairies (and gave rise to all 
   those grown up Italian ladies cosplaying Winx Club characters, 
   whatever the fuck cosplaying means). I suppose you'd only be offended 
   by all that objectification if you were a woman yourself, and seeing 
   as my wife didn't even know who Daria Nicolodi was when I told her 
   that she'd just sadly passed away, I'd say we're in pretty safe 
   territory for ogling Nadia Cassini's arse, so have the Kleenex at the 
   ready. It's all good.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Is this film funny or even worth tracking down? It's okay I suppose. 
   The comedy is very broad though, and even though it takes the piss 
   out of <B><A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_1978.htm">DAWN OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
   at the end by having the zombies being the ones in the supermarket 
   besieged by the living, the ending is still a total cop out. It was 
   okay I guess. I did feel a bit relieved when it ended, to be honest.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Notable notable: Nadia Cassini also starred in <B><A HREF="#GodSerpent1970">THE
    SERPENT GOD</A></B>, which I now know is also on YouTube. The 
   strange thing is, when I searched on YouTube itself the film didn't

   same thing with Bing (!) of all things. So if you're searching for 
   films, use different search engines. That's how I end watching so 
   many of these films.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film starts with Rick waking up with no memory in what looks 
   exactly like the village from <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Amazonia1985">AMAZONIA:

   why the natives are so friendly to Rick, because throughout the film 
   whenever Rick ends up in this village, a guy with a machine gun in a 
   helicopter turns up and starts blowing the crap out of everything. 
   Why? I'm not sure. I thought he was Rick's partner, but he might have 
   a drug dealer or something.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rick escapes the helicopter and jungle, but then gets sent right 
   back in there with a female sidekick in tow. Turns out his partner, 
   whom he can't remember, was her fianc&eacute; and they'd found some 
   sort of emerald mine or temple out in the jungle somewhere. It's a 
   shame Rick can't remember where it is, because an angry, violent

   take them there anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Rhodes' gang, Rick and the chick end up going on a jungle trek, 
   where Rick tricks piranha fish into eating a guy, a spider into 
   biting some other guy in the face, and then everyone gets kidnapped 
   by a bigger group of violent folk. It doesn't make much sense but our 
   heroes escape, turn up at the village (where Rick seems to have a 
   topless girlfriend) only for the helicopter guy to turn up and start 
   murdering everyone again. If I was the chief of that tribe I would 
   have tied Rick to a pole, drawn a target on his chest and run for shelter.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (2012) and thought that's as bad as animation can get, check out this 
   one, which is exponentially worse, although it does have the excuse 
   of being extremely low budget. It's also a God film, with an unhappy 
   kid called Joshua (who looks like a lion, but has no tail and looks 
   bizarrely naked) hiding in his room from his miserable parents and 
   being visited by a ghost creature who looks like he's made of 
   television static. After a dodgy sounding conversation &quot;Come

   where I must say the main problem for me was how much of an asshole

    While a purple flying creature with a bow-tie narrates for us,

   becomes the object of Moses' desire, or at least that was the 
   impression that I got from the 'you can pitch your tent next to mine 
   Joshua' - sounds to me like Moses was pitching a tent right there and 
   then if you know what I mean!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The thing that gets me about this whole set up is that God 
   (presented here as a gigantic ball of flame that can fly and shoot 
   lightening but can't fight Moses' battles for him) makes a big deal 
   of choosing Moses and the Jews as his chosen ones, but then he makes 
   a big deal of destroying the Egyptians (whom he created), the 
   Malacites (whom he created) and the Canaanites (who he not only 
   created, he made them break the Ten Commandments as well). The 
   rewards of Moses' faith is to wander the desert for years and die 
   without him or all the original escaped slaves every entering the 
   promised land. That doesn't sound like a god - that sounds like a 
   petulant gamer playing a sandbox game in 'evil' mode or a kid in a 
   bad mood hurling his action figures around. Why didn't they just all 
   tell God to fuck off? He would have probably had a tantrum and killed 
   them all anyway, but at least it would have been quicker.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But that's not the message this weird-ass film is out to give you. 
   Here, God will give you the strength so that your stressed out freaky 
   looking lion parents will forgive each other their sins and get on 
   with life. My daughter watched this and couldn't stop laughing until 
   she remembered twenty minutes into it that she'd actually stopped 
   playing a video game to come see what shite her dad was watching this

   and <B>For Fuck's Sake, Jesus</B> (<I>God, I hope this isn't a real

   but it is rooted in reality much more than those other films.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The focus here is on Jesus's relationship with Maddalena, who in 
   this film is a high-class prostitute servicing the more rich (and 
   middle-aged) clients of Rome, bringing home her hard-earned cash to 
   her pimp, Angelo Infanti who plays the bodyguard who betrays Al 
   Pacino in <B><A HREF="godfather_1972.htm">THE GODFATHER</A></B>, who 
   coincidentally has a violent right hand man in the form of Franco 
   Citti, who played the bodyguard who didn't betray Al Pacino in <B>THE GODFATHER</B>.
    Maddalena is in the park one day with her pimp when her fancy 
   bird-glider thing lands at the feet of the Guitarist, a Jesus figure 
   played by Leonard Mann. She stoops to pick it up, but he, for some 
   reason, stands on it, which makes her fall in love. I would have 
   thought that was more of a dick move than anything, but there you go.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Leonard and his five (?) apostles, including <A HREF="luciano_rossi_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Luciano
    Rossi</A>, get arrested for some reason and the besotted Maddalena 
   can't get him out of her head, even drawing a picture of him in 
   lipstick to kiss in the local sleazy bar she dances in. That night, 
   she contacts one of her high-ranking clients and gets him released. 
   She's totally in love with the guy, but if she's out hanging around 
   with Jesus, who's making Angelo the dough he needs to maintain a 
   healthy, silky moustache? Nobody, that's who.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    During the romance we learn that Maddalena ended up in her 
   profession because she was gang-raped as a child and ended up liking 
   it (from what I could gather, ensuring this film would never be 
   released in the UK), plus, even though he walks around with a guitar, 
   it seems Leonard actually plays church organ in his groovy band. 
   Angelo the pimp doesn't like this, so he has Franco Citti demonstrate 
   what happens to errant hookers by having Maddalena witness the severe 
   beating (and pissing on) of a hooker while her boyfriend is tied to 
   some scaffolding and has his face cut up. <B><A HREF="white_pop_jesus_1980.htm">WHITE

    While a bit talky, Stelvio Massi injects enough darkness, quick 
   editing, and quirkiness into the film to make it watchable. I'm sure 
   the crappy print doesn't do his usual great cinematography justice,

   Rossi-Stuart's dumbass son Jimbo Rossi-Stuart mistook the local film 
   studio for a hardware store, he was accidentally recruited to play 
   Karate Warrior, an ignorant twat whose only weaknesses are his 
   inability to perform Karate and the his own brain. Taught to use blue 
   magic to knock out cows, something he would literally never do again, 
   Jimbo went on to become Karate Warrior, the shittiest super-hero of all.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For the first two films. After that it was some other guy. Due to 
   them featuring a tall, ayran, arrogant swine lording it over 
   everyone, the series was highly popular in Germany and spawned many 
   sequels. Let's suffer through them now!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If you didn't hate Karate Warrior/Human Punch Bag Jimbo Rossi-Stuart 
   enough in the first film, don't worry. Director Fabrizio De Angelis 
   devotes the first ten minutes of the sequel establishing that Jimbo 
   is the biggest jerk on the planet.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Not only does Jimbo (Jimbo Rossi-Stuart, from <B><A HREF="name_of_the_rose_1986.htm">THE
    NAME OF THE ROSE</A></B> [?] and <B><A HREF="domino_1988.htm">DOMINO</A></B> 
   [that's more like it]) ditch his girlfriend to attend his birthday 
   party, he gets on his bike and knocks bags of shopping out of two 
   pensioner's hands before shortly kicking the bonnet of a Porsche. 
   When the Porsche driver takes after him, Jimbo then mocks him for 
   getting caught speeding by the police. Nothing endears the audience 
   to a character like having him assault a pensioner and causing 
   criminal damage.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jimbo then goes to his surprise birthday party (I think it's a 
   birthday party, but they may be celebrating Scott winning the 
   'Biggest Tosser of the Year Award') where his grandparents reward him 
   for his behaviour by giving him a brand-new car that he can take to 
   college with him. A mere five minutes later, Jimbo is out on the road 
   causing a road rage incident by tailgating and beeping his horn at a 
   seemingly innocent car. When the car turns out to be full of 
   aggressive karate experts, Jimbo's car ends up in a swamp and he 
   hitches a lift with new friend/stalker Luke. And we're supposed to 
   feel sorry for him!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's no surprise that all these karate guys go to the same college 
   as Jimbo and Luke and even less of a surprise when it turns out that 
   Jimbo's father, whom Jimbo did not know attended the same college as 
   him, had the lead karate guy's father kicked out of school twenty 
   years ago. It seems that everyone at this college (with the exception 
   of Luke, who lives in a huge house and only has champagne and caviar 
   to eat [?]) knows karate and the only way to solve any problems is to 
   kick each other in the face. Which they don't do that often.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The lead karate guy is aptly named Dick and Jimbo not only tried to 
   ram him off the road and has a father who had Dick's father expelled, 
   he also steals Dick's girlfriend from him. Don't feel sorry for Dick, 
   because he's just as bad as Jimbo, and arranges for them to have a 
   fight in front of the entire school in a scene that Fabrizio De 
   Angelis will continue to provide various versions of in all the sequels.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But that's only halfway through the film! How can Dick get the 
   better of Jimbo? By bringing in the biggest jerk of all to kick 
   Jimbo's face in. Throw a spanner in the works when Jimbo's old mentor 
   turns up to remind him of the blue magic punch thing</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>*</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   and karate chop him in the neck for not listening and you have a 
   sequel that throws in more jerkiness, more pouting from Jimbo, more 
   road rage, and an extra mooning the camera during the fight at the 
   end. All that culminates in the greatest Krappy Warrior film out of 
   the two I've watched so far! And this is the second time I've watched 
   it, because I caught this one on Italian television years ago. I

    It seems that our original Karate Warrior, Tony Scott, has moved 
   away from the small coastal town to South Dakota! Who can step into 
   his shoes as the biggest twat martial-arse champion in the US? No one 
   it seems, which is why his golden kimono and various items are kept 
   in some sort of shrine by best friend/stalker Leo. I betcha Leo's not 
   averse to slipping on that kimono when he thinks no-ones looking.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It seems that bad guy Dick is still around though, even though 
   inexplicably his name has now changed to Joe. Joe/Dick has not 
   learned any lessons about strutting about the place acting like he's 
   got three balls, so who now is going to stop Joe giving Leo an 
   ass-kicking every two minutes? Enter Larry.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What you'll notice right away about Larry is that he's not an 
   asshole like Jimbo Rossi-Stuart was. Plus, he doesn't even know 
   anything about karate! Like most of these films, Larry, his sister, 
   and his mother are all at risk from being evicted by an evil 
   landowner, who's niece Larry has just met and fallen for. Larry needs 
   $2500 dollars to save his house, so luckily there is a cycling event 
   taking place, and better still, the grand prize is $2500! All Larry 
   needs now is some jerks to ruin everything for him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Larry also agrees to take on Dick in a low-budget karate fight, so 
   obviously not knowing how to practice karate is a bit of an issue 
   there. There are only two possible people in town who can teach Larry 
   how to kick Dick's dick in the dick, so let's present it as a 
   multiple choice question:</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    1) Is it the fat guy who sells fried chicken, doesn't practice 
   karate, and is the comedy sidekick, or-</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    2) Is it the Japanese guy who has just opened as Japanese restaurant 
   in town, has just kicked three moron's heads in, and was once the 
   world's top martial art master?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Answer: Fabrizio De Angelis probably has OCD.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Larry needs a crash course in ass-kicking because he's got three 
   days to learn karate, stop his eviction, win the girl's heart, and 
   get that goddamned $2500? You knows it!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Completely generic in every way a teen sports drama can be, yet 
   filtered through an Italian brain so that you get such important 
   stuff as a Halloween party where Dick comes dressed as original 
   Karate Warrior, a cycling race that's terrible in every aspect, and 
   bad guys who laugh at everything, the cheese is so thick here the 
   actors practically wade through it. If you liked <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#KarateWarrior">KARATE

    It seems that being continually kicked in the face during the last 
   two Karate Warrior films has not diminished jerk John Carson's 
   attempts to become top asshole in whatever weird social situation 
   these people exist in throughout these films. At first, I thought all 
   the youngsters involved where at college or something, but now that 
   John Carson looks like he's entering his forties, I have no idea 
   what's going on here. Are they all just unemployed bums? With the 
   exception of the fried chicken guy, no one seems to do any work or 
   have any means of supporting themselves, while seemingly having all 
   the time in the world to antagonise each other in the fighting tournaments.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It doesn't help that I had to watch the film in Italian either, 
   although that did make the nightclub scenes funnier as I got to hear 
   someone try and rap in Italian. Basically, Larry the winner from the 
   last Karate Warrior film is happy with his girlfriend but John 
   Carson's still out to get him, which he does this time round by 
   having some South Korean karate champ seduce and humiliate his sister 
   in public.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Larry isn't happy at this and neither is his similar looking buddy 
   who is his sister's boyfriend. This gives way to a repeat of that soul-destroying
    cycle race from the last film as our good guys have to take on the 
   bad guys at a motorcycling race that just eats up time and makes you 
   wonder why you aren't looking up porn on the internet instead. 
   There's also a few sub-plots, like Larry hating on war veteran Dad 
   David Warbeck, and something involving diet pills the chicken guy is 
   taking that are used to poison Larry before his underwhelming fight 
   with Bruce Wayne the South Korean dickhead.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Just as terrible as the preceding three Karate Warrior films but 
   somehow also featuring porn guy Ron Jeremy as some point (I wouldn't 
   have known this if I hadn't nicked that information from another 
   site), <B>KARATE WARRIOR 4</B> serves to remind you that the early 
   nineties were just like the late eighties, with more house music. Who 
   are these people though? Why did David Warbeck agree to do anything 
   this? And don't say money, because this film was funded by collecting 
   spare change outside of a train station.</FONT></FONT></P>

    This John Carson guy is gay for Karate Warrior, isn't he? He's 
   obsessed with the guy. He longs to hold Karate Warrior close (wearing 
   his famous golden Kimono), but just can't work up the courage to come 
   out of the closet. This is the fourth time round for John Carson and 
   his ever changing sidekicks (I think this is because John tries to 
   fruit them up after being beaten by Karate Warrior once again), and 
   this time round things are getting downright illegal!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    John thinks this time it's a good idea to talk giant car thief Marty 
   Wright into a match with Karate Warrior, in the usual crappy gym 
   where nearly every Karate Warrior film has ended. He kind of did that 
   the last time when he made that guy from Korean fight Karate Warrior 
   while he Karated his own Warrior whilst watching from the sidelines. 
   Also, Marty's mates get the idea to kidnap Karate Warrior's 
   girlfriend, blackmail her rich dad, and pin the crime on the fat 
   fried chicken guy from the last 600 Karate Warrior films.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Angelis decides to leave the actual Karate until one hour and sixteen 
   minutes into the film and instead concentrate on fat guy joining a 
   club called the Extra Large Club of America where tubby folk can 
   hanging around with each other. This is where fat guy gets involved

   mate in the sea, Carson's pretend girlfriends being bitchy (different 
   again, probably because Carson accidentally shouted &quot;Karate 
   Warrior!&quot; at the point of orgasm with his previous girlfriend), 
   and Karate Warrior learning a new special move he can bust out at the

    Finally, for the last Karate Warrior film, director Fabrizio De 
   Angelis decides to change things up a bit by having the action take 
   place on a Greek island. And what action takes place on that island? 
   The same shit that's happened in the last four or five Karate Warrior 
   films; a motorcycle contest, some half-arsed mentoring, and a very 
   low budget face-off with a jerk.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's no sign of arch-nemesis Joe Carson this time around, so 
   maybe he moved away or killed himself or something. The rest of the 
   gang are still here though: Larry the Karate Warrior, fat fried 
   chicken guy Leo, guy that looks like Larry but is slightly taller and 
   some other guy. Plus Larry's rich girlfriend, but she's not in it much.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As usual, most of the actual story revolves around Leo, who this 
   time finds himself ten grand up when he fakes being knocked over by 
   an African dignitary's limo. Leo decides it's time they got a bit of 
   a holiday and decide on Greece, where everyone knows karate and 
   everyone is as big of a jerk as Joe Carson was. This allows director 
   De Angelis plenty of time to suck the fun out of everything by making 
   us sit through Leo and his gang going on a shopping spree, flying to 
   Greece, discuss getting a taxi, then getting a taxi, then doing a bit 
   of sightseeing before discussing a buffet breakfast.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The only halfway interesting part of this film is the strange scam 
   Leo falls far when he pay five hundred dollars to take pictures of 
   what he's told is a mermaid, only for the mermaid to turn out to be a 
   guy and Leo turning out to be a moron when he has all his money and 
   plane tickets home stolen! If only there was some sort of contest 
   with a cash prize that Larry can win in order for them to get home. 
   And there is - <B>JUST LIKE THE LAST FOUR FUCKING FILMS</B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Larry needs a bike, and luckily he's just beaten up two goons that 
   work for a jerk whose ex-girlfriend has a bike. The jerk is called 
   Mustafa, and strangely the highly-camp acting skills of this fellow 
   somehow didn't lead to a career in Hollywood, but it sure provided me 
   with a lot of laughs. Which is just as well as the bit where they all 
   repair the bike goes on forever. The ex-girlfriend, Eleni, starts 
   making goo-goo eyes at Karate Warrior, but he stays loyal, even 
   though Eleni is definitely an upgrade.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    All this staggers lamely towards the showdown, although Karate 
   Warrior's got to bring in his mentor, his girlfriend, and father 
   David Warbeck in order to bet it together long enough to beat up 
   Mustafa (who hilariously says &quot;Prepare to be killed&quot; in the 
   lamest, least threatening voice ever). I'll tell you another thing; 
   Mustafa kicks the shit out of Karate Warrior and decks him several 
   times so that Karate Warrior can lay there staring at his father, but 
   when Karate Warrior decks Mustafa once, he's counted out and Karate 
   Warrior wins. I don't think that referee was being impartial and 
   reckon that someone slipped him a few drachmas before the match started.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And thus concludes my pointless trail through the most worthless 
   film series in cinematic history. As a precaution against any other 
   Karate Warrior films being made, the Italian government executed most 
   of the cast and crew.</FONT></FONT></P>

   Italy, Adventure, Director: Demofilo Fidani)</FONT></FONT><BR>

   actors: Ettore Manni! Edmund Purdom (dubbing only)!</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">You
    know you are in for a fun ride when Demofilo Fidani misspells the 
   fake name he's given to Karzan actor Armando Bottin, who is billed 
   here as Jhonny Kissmuller Jr. There's also another actor listed as 
   Crazy Matthew, so you're not even out of the credits before realising 
   this film is something special.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The thing is, I honestly can't tell if Fidani is taking the piss or 
   not. Judging by the last ten minutes, it would seem that he is, but I 
   just can't tell if he tacked that on because what goes before it is 
   so goofy and hilarious. I mean, most of the film is your bog standard 
   jungle adventure story, but with the tone of Bruno Mattei's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellLivingDead1980">ZOMBIE
    CREEPING FLESH</A></B>. Plus, Karzan, who has a sidekick chimp 
   called Chika, doesn't even turn up until forty five minutes into the 
   film, and that's while his girlfriend Shiran is having a sexy cat 
   fight with a blacked-up Carla Mancini wearing an afro wig.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first half of the film details a scientist hiring Ettore Manni, 
   a journalist, some lady and harmonica playing mute called Crazy to go 
   to Africa and bring back Karzan, whom they've spotted in some 
   travelogue footage. Ettore reckons he can make a pretty penny from 
   Karzan, whereas the scientist wants to keep him for research, and so 
   they all head off to Africa and an awful lot of stock footage. Don't 
   worry about animal cruelty in this one folks - Ettore Manni starts 
   shooting at an elephant, and director Fidani can't even afford 
   footage of an elephant being shot, so instead we get short shots of 
   an elephant bathing in a river. Also when I think about it you do see 
   stock footage of a bison getting shot later, so forget that thing I 
   said about there being no animal cruelty.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film is pretty entertaining and daft before Karzan even turns 
   up. The girl gets a fake looking spider crawling up her leg, and 
   Crazy blows it away with a blow dart! Their jeep gets stuck in the 
   sand, so Fidani cuts in stock footage of a lion looking bored to ramp 
   up the excitement. Funky looking savages attack our brave white 
   travellers while their bag carriers cower in fear. You can see how 
   that would cause offence, but the terrible dummy of a savage falling 
   from a tree was pretty funny. Everyone runs away from a huge battle 
   with the natives before all of a sudden they are tied to poles and 
   about to be sacrificed by the aforementioned Carla Mancini and a guy 
   who is seemingly having a GREAT time battering away at some bongos.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is when Karzan and Shiran turn up to rescue the lot of them, 
   taking away the young lady to their treehouse, where she shows Shiran 
   how time works and what her name is in a remarkably cringey scene. I 
   thought we were maybe building up to a sexy threesome or something, 
   but it turns out just to be a load of fluff before the white men show 
   up to take Karzan and Shiran back to civilisation. They grab Shiran 
   but Karzan escapes, mainly because he hasn't fought any animals yet.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The crocodile fight is pretty funny as the crocodile is one of the 
   worst I've seen, but I have to admit that one of my favourites scene 
   here must be when Karan is walking through the jungle when a guy in 
   the worst ape suit in history challenges him to a fight. Now, the 
   jungle blabber Karzan and Shiran spout had me laughing a lot, but 
   when Karzan kicks the ape's arse and it goes off in a huff, muttering 
   to itself, I nearly lost it. Please note that this film is still 
   played 100% straight at this point, even though it's obvious the 
   mouth of the ape suit isn't working right and keeps hanging open.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is where things start getting strange for Karzan, because he 
   gets captured and ends up in a cage in a zoo, where an old man laughs 
   at him and calls him an asshole...and then...</FONT></FONT></P>

   and people ending a scene by either walking or shoving an object 
   towards the camera? Or did Fidani realise he didn't have an ending 
   for the film and just tried to say 'you see, it was a comedy all 
   along'. Who knows? I sure don't, but that's why I like Italian 
   cinema. You just never know what you're getting into sometimes. If 
   the bulk of the film is a satire, I think Fidani played his cards too 
   close to his chest, but I believe the ending was inserted to mask the 
   stinker of a film that it follows. I enjoyed it either way.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Kinski's narcissistic personality disorder becomes manifest in this 
   tribute to violinist Niccolo Paganini, but in having written and 
   directed the film, what we really get here is a film where Klaus 
   Kinski celebrates himself. Seriously, this film basically starts with 
   Kinski receiving a standing ovation before he even starts a 
   performance, and when he does start it, the ladies in the audience 
   start jilling themselves off!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This terrible, disjointed pile of crap is acclaimed by some as a 
   window into Kinski's mind, and if that is so, it's like looking in on 
   a pile of discarded cartilage that somehow became sentient and tried 
   to reproduce by shagging itself. Literally every woman in this film 
   is aroused by Kinski, who sometimes looks like Wolverine if he drank 
   two bottles of vodka a day and had at least six or seven gypsy curses 
   working on him at one time, although sometimes he looks like Edward 
   Scissorhands if he'd been kept in an underground Austrian slave cage 
   while suffering from untreated mental disorders for which he was 
   suddenly diagnosed and given all his strong medication in one huge dose.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Apart from all the ladies in the audience flicking their beans to 
   his off-key caterwauling, there's also the woman who gets so aroused 
   by Paganini that she chugs one out to some horses getting it on, 
   which brought back my horse porn trauma of Massimo Dallamano's <B><A HREF="devil_in_the_flesh_1969.htm">VENUS
    IN FURS</A></B>, and that's not the worst crime Kinski commits here. 
   He gets so entrenched in documenting Paganini's sexual prowess (aka 
   his sexual prowess) that he has him receiving a blow job from a 
   possible underage hooker while fantasising about even more underage 
   girls. In light of what one of Kinskis daughters accused him of, this 
   made the fish fingers and baked beans I had for dinner crawl back up 
   my throat. Oh, and thanks for killing both a chicken and a goat in 
   this one Kinski, you fucking Easter Island statue looking nonce.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I watched Kinski's original version of the film so I don't know what 
   the official version contains, but what you get here is Kinski 
   possibly rimming a woman, actually 'dining at the Y', having a woman 
   beg him for more because he's so good, and lifting Debora Caprioglio 
   into the air so he can nuzzle her gigantic breasts. Careful there 
   Klaus, you might lose an eye there, and we don't want one of those 
   weird fuckers getting loose on the world.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's no real plot and the whole thing is filmed in the Cinema 
   Verite style, which means loads of shaky cameras and out-of-focus 
   stuff. The whole thing jumps back and forth in time too, so it starts 
   with Paganini on his death bed (possibly by catching sight of himself 
   in the mirror), and ends by Kinski discarding all the actually 
   interesting sex stuff to focus on his relationship with his son, so 
   that the last half hour of the film is interminably boring.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   YELLOW CARPET</A></B>, most of this film takes place in one location 
   - the Kleinhoff Hotel, located somewhere in Germany. Clery ends up 
   there because she misses her flight back to Paris and choose the 
   hotel because of a sordid relationship she had there back when she 
   was a student. She's a bit shocked to find the place run down and 
   filled with low-lifes, but decides to stay there anyway for nostalgic reasons.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That same night, she hears crazed muttering from the room next door 
   and finds that there's a crack at the top of the adjoining door where 
   she can just about see what's going on. The guy in there is Karl 
   (played by Bruce Robinson, who would go on to direct the very famous 
   British film <B><A HREF="withnail_and_i_1987.htm">WITHNAIL &amp; I</A></B>).
    Karl's a bit highly strung and seems to be hiding out in the hotel 
   for as yet unknown reasons. He does seem to have a girlfriend, a 
   junky by the name of Petra who likes to shoot up in his room, much to 
   his disapproval. Clery finds herself fascinated by Karl, and judging 
   by the inquisitive looks she gets from him when their eyes meet out 
   in the hall, the feeling might be reciprocated.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Clery should really be going back to Paris and back to her rich, 
   unfulfilled life, but she remains at the hotel, watching Karl and 
   listening in on his conversations. One day Karl is visited by 
   photographer Werner Pochath (don't get excited - he's only in this 
   one scene) and Clery learns that Karl is part of a radical political 
   movement who plan on various activities to shake up the system. There 
   also seems to be some sort of inner turmoil in the group, as a 
   member, Pedro (played by perennially depressed looking Michele 
   Placido) seems to have become a turncoat.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, Clery isn't interested in all that. Clery clearly wants to 
   get into Karl's pants, big style, and no doubt anyone who has spotted 
   the word 'film' and the name 'Corrine Clery' knows what's going to 
   happen next. That's right - Clery gets naked and pretty much stays in 
   that state more and more frequently until the film ends.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now I thought this film would bore me to tears at first, but it does 
   pick up a bit. Karl's politics and Karl's mental health keep coming 
   to the fore while Clery seems to see Karl as an escape from her 
   boring, settled life back into the past when she was free. Or 
   something like that. It's a Carlo Lizzani film - not exactly full of 
   hilarious dialogue and slapstick. Even when he does start off with a 
   light-hearted film, it usually ends up being a horribly depressing 
   experience - check out his film <B><A HREF="black_turin_1972.htm">BLACK
    TURIN</A></B> - that's one bi-polar film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For fans of naked Corrine Clery only or Carlo Lizzani completists. 
   Or fans of Bruce Robinson having screaming sessions while listening 
   to jazz.</FONT></FONT></P>

   the plot was the same, and it kind of was...up to a point.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Basically, some married man gets depressed at the revelation that 
   his wife was thinking of cheating on him and goes for a wander 
   through the city at night, encountering a pervy secret society. This 
   happens in the book and the film, but the film is also full of

    There also seems to be a sinister recurring character who must be

   looking for her mother, who also seems to be suffering from a bad 
   case of arthouse movie surrealism. Everything is rather dreamlike as

    policeman Roman is back! Things have gone a bit pear-shaped after 
   the arrest of criminal superbastard Semanca has just been set free 
   with all charges dropped, as the courts believe that he was merely 
   passing by that warehouse from the last film where that gun battle 
   took place. This greatly upsets Roman, as that mean his cop buddy 
   Miclovan died for nothing. Worse still, Miclovan could have shot 
   Semanca that night, if Roman hadn't unintentionally blocked his shot. 
   Worse still, Semanca is being a dick by claiming to everyone that 
   Roman saved his life. Roman slowly begins to realise that Miclovan 
   was right, and basically begins turning into him, following a 
   thoughtfully black and white visitation to his dead mate's grave.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Just like the last film, we get thrown straight into the action as 
   Semanca's men try to rob a train (I think), prompting Roman and an 
   army of police to storm the railyard, and a huge gun battle ensues, 
   involving grenades and exploding trains. I couldn't help but notice 
   that this reminded me of a similar scene in Enzo Castellari's <B><A HREF="big_racket_1976.htm">THE
    BIG RACKET</A></B>, and the credits in this one are very similar to 
   Big Enzo's <B><A HREF="street_law_1974.htm">STREET LAW</A></B>. Most 
   definitely a coincidence, but note I got a huge Castellari vibe from <B><A HREF="with_clean_hands_1972.htm">WITH
    CLEAN HANDS</A></B>, so fans of him might want to check these films out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The post-war political turmoil continues in Bucharest as socialist 
   protesters are seemingly gunned down by the police, although this is 
   a set up by Semanca to disrupt things. Teaming up with the twin 
   brother of a guy who Roman accidentally got killed in this last film, 
   which is something I neglected to mention in the review of <B>WITH 
   CLEAN HANDS</B>, Roman sets out to bring Semanca down by targeting 
   his brother, who is also a smug rich asshole.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eventually Roman ends up going undercover at a Monastery (don't ask 
   why), sporting a full beard and long hair that makes him look a bit 
   like Liam Neason. The monks are impressed by his speaking voice (???) 
   but soon it turns out there's an escaped Nazi war criminal hiding 
   there, so it becomes a bit of mystery as Roman tries to track down 
   who this guy actually is. Plus, it becomes kind of funny how many 
   monks aren't really monks and how many of them are sporting fake 
   beards and wigs.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    My only problem with this film is that there's no huge, violent 
   battle at the end to cap things off, but there's still a pretty 
   satisfying conclusion to matters. Fred tells me there's another four 
   of these films kicking about out there too. Maybe we'll get to them.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Oh, I meant to mention that both <B>WITH CLEAN HANDS</B> and <B>THE

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Imagine
    my horror when I discovered that there wasn't just one Italian 
   animated film involving the Titanic and animals, but three! THREE! 
   There is no god. This happens sometimes when exploring Italian films. 
   Once upon a time I thought there were maybe two or three films based 
   around the story of White Fang. Now I know there's at least nine.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anyway - Camillo Teti's deplorable <B><A HREF="titanic_the_legend_goes_on_2000.htm">TITANIC:
    THE LEGEND GOES ON</A></B> now appears to me to have been cobbled 
   together quickly to confuse the money-paying public into thinking 
   they were watching this film, which is still bad, but tending more 
   towards good-bad rather than total shite bad. No rapping dogs here 
   for starters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film is also comparably better animated than the other one, but 
   still pretty crappy. It's the story here that makes it easier to 
   watch, because it's so fucking ridiculous. The set up is as usual - a 
   bunch of humans get on the Titanic from various levels in society. 
   One Duke and his daughter are on board, pursued by a suitor who wants 
   to marry into the family and obtain a global whaling contract. On 
   another level, a bunch of talking animals get on board too, including 
   a mouse who is telling the entire story in flashback to his 
   grandchildren (and it's heavily implied at the end by his wife that 
   he may just be talking absolute bollocks).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So far, so shite, as a romantic sub-plot develops between the 
   daughter and some gypsy guy. Luckily things pick up slightly as the 
   daughter's tears hit a moonbeam and she ends up being able to 
   understand a floating dolphin while the suitor's minion tells a gang 
   of mobster sharks that they have to sink the ship by tricking a 
   gigantic octopus into throwing an iceberg at the Titanic. I haven't 
   watched the James Cameron version of events - was there any floating 
   dolphins in that one?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Best of all is the octopus, which for some reason has the face of 
   Casper The Ghost, only with a dog's nose. I also think that there was 
   mentally something wrong with the octopus too, because he seemed 
   awfully susceptible to suggestion by anyone around him, gleefully 
   throwing icebergs around so he could win a shark's hat, getting 
   guilt-tripped by a dolphin, holding the Titanic together so our 
   heroes can escape, and most bizarrely of all, letting a bunch of 
   animals have a party on his head at the end of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Due to the outlandish events, this one is less painful to sit 
   through than <B>TITANIC: THE LEGEND GOES ON</B>. At least some 
   attempt is made to actually entertain, even though it doesn't make 
   any sense and no child in its right mind would watch this. My 
   favourite bit was when the octopus ran (!) to the ship to save it.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Whatever the reason, it's an example of what's right about <B>LITTLE HERO</B> 
   - there's loads of moments that make you stop and scratch your head, 
   but what should be a cavalcade of weirdness is offset with patches of 
   terrible slapstick comedy, constant ear-rape, and a very distinct 
   lack of a decent plot. The end result is watchable but no classic.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot is this: bad guys Gold Mask and Silver Mask (who can fly) 
   want two precious swords off a local rich man, and kidnap the man's 
   daughter. That's pretty much the plot. Little Hero is roped in to 
   rescue her, which is quite fortunate as she/he has already gone up 
   against the Mask brother's goons, including a mascara wearing dwarf, 
   in a string covered, gravity defying fight at the start of the film. 
   Hero is helped by two sidekicks who also provide some deeply unfunny 
   comedy, and some other guy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Basically, Little Hero wanders around looking for swords while 
   encountering the dwarf guy and his sidekicks encased in metal balls, 
   tiger and elephant men who looks like members of the cast of <B><A HREF="#Cats2019">CATS</A></B>

   bonkers, eh?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Except without exception these crazy scenes are followed up by an 
   endless slapstick scene where the two sidekicks laugh or scream 
   endlessly, dragging on and on and on like some mental illness has 
   manifested itself onto your screen. And that's about it - good stuff 
   followed by bad stuff. Hardcore kung fu fans might get a kick from

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot this time, when the film gets around to it after about 
   fifteen minutes, involves the murder of a witness by a hitman posing 
   as a cop during a prison riot. Before we get to that, we have Bombolo 
   robbing a man of all his possessions while a naked lady distracts the 
   fellow, Massimo Vanni going undercover as a lady of the night and 
   Milian destroying a car during a sledgehammer fight with a guy 
   running a protection racket. Then, Milian walks into a bookkeepers, 
   blows all his money on horseracing, then robs the place before being arrested...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Turns out this was all a top secret ruse as the guy who was murdered 
   could have put a NYC mafia don behind bars, and Milian now has to 
   pretend to escape prison, go to New York, ingratiate himself with the 
   boss and find out who the hitman was in order to restore the 
   reputation of the Italian police. In the world of Inspector Giraldi, 
   the really means getting Milian into various situation where Milian 
   can act up and provide some laughs, be it stealing a taxi and tailing 
   the mafia boss (Wallach) around New York while passenger Taylor Meade</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="3"><B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">*</FONT></B></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While it gets off to a good start the film kind of drags in the

   only laughs provided by Wallach's ugly daughter (due to her Scottish 
   mother!) having the hots for Milian and pursuing him all the way to 
   Vegas, where Milian struts around in a pimp suit while funky Goblin 
   music plays.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Luckily, the film redeems itself by getting all serious. Milian 
   finds his hitman, but then is framed for murder, allowing Milian to 
   drop his swaggering persona in favour of a more vulnerable, 
   frightened man, as he desperately tries to find a way out of a facing 
   the death penalty. Tom Felleghy turns up as the jobsworth warden of 
   the prison to make his usual cameo.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    You'll notice I've not mentioned Bombolo much, as he's left behind 
   in Rome and vanishes in the first third of the film. He still gets a 
   few slaps however. Instead, Enzo Cannavale takes his place as 
   sidekick. For reasons I can't figure out, Milian goes to see New York 
   soccer team Cosmos at one point, so we get to see stock footage of 
   legends Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Mino Reitano finds that every cloud has a silver lining when he 
   returns to the guest house he lives in when not out at sea. He is 
   first informed that the landlady has died while he was away, but it 
   turns out her hot niece has just inherited the place, and she's 
   single and interested in Mino. Plus, he gets to pick her up from the 
   airport, so he can start putting the moves on her right away.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    After roughly seven or so seconds of screen time it seems our couple 
   are in love, but what the plot isn't in a hurry to do is explain why 
   we keep cutting away to rich millionaire Philippe Leroy and his 
   sister (wife? I had to watch in Italian and didn't quite catch her 
   relation to him). Both seemed bored with lounging around drinking, 
   gambling, and partying, and both seem keen on having lackey Luciano 
   Catenacci go out on an errand that somehow involves Mino. Docker 
   Franco Fantasia seems in on things too, but what are they up to?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, Mino finds discovers that in life, the good times are 
   fleeting and a shitstorm is always waiting around the corner as Ewa 
   gets attacked in her room by a drunken Nello Pazzafini and during her 
   stay in hospital it is discovered that she has a heart defect that 
   (informs Doctor Franco Ressel, sporting the weakest, most transparent 
   combover ever) needs an operation that's going to cost a shitload of 
   money. Mino resolves to get that money, be it through a weird 
   encounter with a giggling lady pawnbroker who wants into his pants, 
   or the suddenly available &#163;300,000 lire being offered by 
   Philippe Leroy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Leroy isn't giving the money away, however. He's just watched Big 
   Arnie in <B><A HREF="running_man_1987.htm">THE RUNNING MAN</A></B> 
   and wants to recreate that film Italian style by having Mino try to 
   get from one end of the city to the other. Five people will try and 
   kill him, using five methods: gun, car, fire, knife, and pogo-stick 
   using specially trained Marmosets brandishing poison-tipped 
   plaster-cast dildoes of Joe Dallesandro's penis, although he does 
   decide that it would be simpler to change that to Mino being beaten 
   to death. And with that, the chase is on! After forty-five minutes of 
   dialogue and not much else happening.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Hilariously, even though they seem to know exactly where Mino is at 
   any given time during the hunt, the killers don't really try that 
   hard to kill Mino. He gets into a knife fight with a guy who just 
   kind of gives up. The guy sent to kill him with a gun seems to have 
   only brought one bullet with him, and weirdest of all, even though 
   Philippe Leroy has arranged all this, he and his other rich mates 
   don't seem to be witnessing what's going on, as if the thrill of 
   anecdotal evidence is enough.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Old Leroy does turn up later though in the film's best scene - Mino 
   ends up in a swanky club where the lights come up on Leroy, Czeremys, 
   and a whole lot of funky people, and they all start dancing to some 
   Hendrix/Funk hybrid while Mino gets attacked by two goons. I can't 
   decide whether it was cool or cheesy. but I did enjoy it on some 
   level. Upon mentioning funk I have now drawn attention to the 
   soundtrack to this film, which the best thing about it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's other things to discover here and while the film has many, 
   many failings, it was still pretty entertaining, Luciano Catenucci 
   gets a much larger role than usual and Philippe Leroy is always a 
   standout, plus you get to see the world's longest cigarette holder, 
   which ironically would take the unsullied lungs of a native pearl 
   diver to be powerful enough to get a drag of smoke out of.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Italy's
    most hit and miss director takes on Italy's most hit and miss 
   sub-genre (the western comedy) and comes up with a film that is 
   totally hit and miss, which means it's mostly enjoyable, except for 
   those bits where it's not.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The premise involves Franco Nero as a dodgy faux-Russian prince 
   posing as a priest to rob a wedding, but then getting roped in to 
   take the last rites from a dying man who knows where a shitload of 
   gold is. Nero finds out the name of the town the gold is near, but 
   learns that the information regarding the actual location of the gold 
   is known by only two men, and he doesn't know their names. He also 
   learns that the only guy who does know their names is about to be 
   hanged as a rebel leader, even though he's not a rebel leader.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He's actually just an ordinary bandit played by Eli Wallach, but 
   Irish revolutionary Lynn Redgrave needs a figurehead to start the 
   Mexican revolution, and seeing as how the actual rebel leader is 
   dead, she's going to use Eli Wallach instead. Nero blags his way into 
   jail but is caught, mainly due to the sheriff being his cousin, whom 
   he paralysed with a bullet to the back years prior, causing the 
   sheriff to walk around wearing a tortoise like armour outfit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nero breaks out Wallach and they reluctantly team up with Redgrave, 
   only to be instantly caught by military general Eduardo Fajardo, 
   who's looking to put down any local insurgents. Fajardo's kind of 
   taken by Redgrave, which works in favour for the Nero/Wallach team 
   up, even if they don't even trust each other. A race across Mexico 
   ensues, as Wallach knows the identity of those have co-ordinates of 
   the location of the gold on their person, whereas Nero knows the town 
   that acts as a starting point for those co-ordinates. Try not to 
   think about it too much.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things eventually lead to Victor Israel, a mining tycoon who 
   underpays his employees, and then some. In a scene that accurately 
   portrays the kind of tonal problems this film has, a violent gunfight 
   breaks out and Wallach and Nero take Israel hostage, where Wallach 
   reveals that half of the co-ordinates are tattooed on Israel's arse. 
   Now, I must point out that Israel has been made to look even more 
   ugly than usual, with a hare lip and mutated nostril and such like, 
   so when Nero pulled down Israel's arse and stared at it from a far 
   too uncomfortable distance, I must admit a part of me died inside, 
   rather than confront that scene head on.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's basically <B><A HREF="good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_1966.htm">THE 
   GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY</A></B>, only it's The Liar, The Thief, 
   and The Irish Terrorist. The premise is the same though, only due to 
   the time this one came out, there had to be a comedy element thrown 
   in there too. The thing is, whereas I'm glad this one didn't go over 
   the top in the slapstick stakes like a lot of these comedy westerns, 
   this one might have gone too far in the other direction, with 
   remarkably grim scenes contrasting badly with Chaplin-like antics. I 
   mean, Marilu Tolo's character can't take as she's had her tongue cut 
   out, but then gets further brutalized and murdered by the military, 
   and yet not much further on Lynn Redgrave (Nero's real-life 
   sister-in-law) has a cheese ball slapstick sequence with Eduardo 
   Fajaro. This happens over and over again - violent gun fights married 
   up to comedy antics. Unlike the film <B><A HREF="my_name_is_nobody_1973.htm">MY
    NAME IS NOBODY</A></B>, or <B><A HREF="california_1977.htm">CALIFORNIA</A></B>,
    where the balance works out, the changes in tone in this one are 
   kind of jarring and annoying.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That said, it's Franco Nero and Eli Wallach up there acting like a 
   couple of fudds, so there's not much to complain about there. When 
   the editing settles down a bit from frenetic, the cinematography does 
   recall the <B><A HREF="#ReturnOfRingo1965">RETURN OF RINGO</A></B> 
   and other goodness, so the film isn't a total washout, but I kind of 
   wish Tessari had settled on a certain mood for this one and just 
   stuck with it, because it seems likes he's going for all moods at 
   once, and it doesn't quite work.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Long Shadow of The Wolf</A><A NAME="LongShadowWolf1971"></A> (1971, 
   Italy, War, Written/Produced/Acted and Directed by: Gianni Manera)</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">It's
    hard to describe Gianni Manera's films. He only directed three of 
   them (and wrote one other, the possibly lost or even non-existent 
   Western <B><A HREF="chrysanthemums_for_a_bunch_of_swine_1968.htm">CHRYSANTHEMUMS
    FOR A BUNCH OF SWINE</A></B>) and all three films exist in already 
   crowded genres. However, despite lack of budget or even acting 
   skills, Manera for me has managed to make his work stand out, just 
   because of how odd his whole approach to film-making.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now that I've watched all three I would say that your introduction 
   to Manera should be the loopy crime/giallo <B><A HREF="#OrdersSignedWhite74">ORDERS
    SIGNED IN WHITE</A></B>, a near two-hour film directed by and 
   starring Manera as a bank robber stuck in a house where a killer is 
   doing in the criminals...and painting their heads white for some 
   reason. This mix of drama, heist, murder and lengthy 
   ski-slope/satanic ritual dream sequence is a must, if you can find 
   the subtitled version. It was there on Youtube at some point, which 
   means it might be there again in the future.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>THE LONG SHADOW OF THE WOLF</B> is the least of Manera's films, 
   but still has plenty of moments and strange directing decisions that 
   will leave you scratching your head. First of all is the title 
   sequence, where Manera's Wolf character, the leader of a group of 
   Italian partisans, crosses a barren landscape while running from the 
   Germans. Quite a typical opener, except for the animated eagle that 
   interrupts the credits for no reason whatsoever.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Wolf and his gang have been troubling the Germans for a while 
   now, so the Wermacht have drafted in SS Lieutenant Heinze Werner, who 
   is missing an arm, possibly lost during one of those epileptic 
   seizure-inducing flashbacks he keeps having at every time he stops to 
   think about anything. His great idea is to draft in a local who now 
   works for the fascists, someone who knows the area, someone who is 
   going to flush The Wolf out, someone who just happens to be The 
   Wolf's childhood best friend and whose ex-lover is now The Wolf's 
   wife and mother of The Wolf's kid (cub?). Drama ahoy!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This childhood friend is Andrea, and when he bumps into The Wolf's 
   sister, she claims that she doesn't know where his childhood 
   sweetheart is now living. She also lies and says The Wolf was killed. 
   These lies are going to cause trouble further down the line, but most 
   confusing for me was the sequence where The Wolf's sister is grabbed 
   by two Germans and raped, but then seems to enjoy it before partisans 
   kill the two Germans and warn her that her brother won't be happy. In 
   true Manera style, none of this is ever mentioned ever again.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Just to confuse the viewer, Manera the director includes an 
   extremely lengthy sequence where the German soldiers and the local 
   Italian aristocracy have a never-ending party which is intercut with 
   the scenes of Manera the actor meeting some US paratroopers and 
   heading out to destroy a chemical lab (a shed with one guy in it). 
   For reasons unknown to anyone but himself, Manera has Lt. Werner's 
   assistant mingle with the party guests even though his character 
   isn't of much significance to the plot, then introduces some people 
   we never see again, then has the camera focuses right up on a guy's 
   face as if he's going to cut away to another scene, only to pull the 
   camera back to reveal some character has entered the room.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This quirkiness livens up what really would be a dull story line, 
   from the billiard-table pocket POV shot to a truly head scratching 
   moment where the camera pans away from the conversation to show a 
   suit of armour that suddenly moves it's arms for no good reason. 
   There's even an animated blood splat that hits the camera in the end 
   battle. What it's meant to convey, I don't know.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm making this out to be a lot more interesting than the film is, 
   being as it is nearly two hours long and featuring about five minutes 
   of action, so be warned. Those looking into the outer-reaches of 
   Italian cinema may find it worth the journey. I don't regret it.</FONT></FONT></P>

    It's all about the hookers. Everyone knows that Italy has the best 
   looking hookers in the world, but do you know why they are always 
   soliciting outside? That's because of what I believe is called the 
   Merlin Law, wherein the practise of selling your body is not illegal 
   if you are doing it outside and not inside a building. So don't say 
   you don't learn something from my demented ramblings. This film in 
   particular introduces us to a shitload of hookers in a park in Rome 
   (possibly the Villa Borghese). I don't remember their names, but 
   there's the young, inexperienced one, the old one, the cynical one, 
   and the one who has just been stabbed to death by an unknown assailant.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film then goes on to detail the lives of these hookers while 
   they are interviewed by the police, as we descend into the life of a 
   hooker, which involves a lot of misogyny, suspenders, the police 
   getting a right eyeful while interviewing prostitutes, getting bummed 
   to death by bikers, getting a bottle rammed up your arse by bikers 
   (although I was never able to determine if these where the same 
   bikers involved in aforementioned bumming incident), and all sorts of 
   crazy crap before the film remembers it's there to solve a murder and 
   we get back to that.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's also a blackmail plot involving Luciano Rossi and Umberto 
   Raho, and I'm not sure which one of them dresses in drag and starts a 
   crazy dance in front of a bewildered hooker, but I'm sure one of them 
   does, and then there's the scene where a hooker picks up a voyeur who 
   takes her back to his apartment which includes a full devil worship 
   suite while he puts on a giant fake nose and starts sniffing around 
   her butt. Man, there's a lot of parallels with <B>TWIN PEAKS</B> here

   sit...just sit there on a pile of empty boxes, eating Lidl brand 
   beans from a tin with my bare hands, my feet resting on a dead dog, 
   totally oblivious that there was a whole society of people out there 
   crippled with worry and anxiety, struggling from day to day, 
   preoccupied by the notion that they were in fact having too much sex

   middle-class, so at the start of the film Musante has already told

   out it. You get to see Florinda Bolkan naked, which doesn't happen 
   very often, but to be honest she could do with a six gallon drum of 
   ice cream as she's like a coat hanger with hair. Jean-Louis 
   Trintignant's' character is detached, so there's not much happening 
   there, so you have to rely on Musante and the young guy for any form 
   of drama. There's also a threesome scene that shows little but must 
   have pushed the envelope a bit back then. It's hard to care for 
   characters like this who have loads of money and free time on their 
   hands to be honest, and I wasn't even too sure what the ending was 
   all about.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    is no one called Daphne in this film. This film was written in part 
   by Renato Polselli. That's why the title refers to a Daphne that 
   doesn't exist, and that's also why a character in this film has two 
   separate flashbacks at the same time, and also why the ending of this

    It's a period drama narrated by a girl who enjoys running through 
   the woods naked. I also enjoyed her running through the woods naked, 
   so everyone is a winner in that respect. She's the niece of rich 
   Uncle Rossano Brazzi (from <B><A HREF="psychout_for_murder_1969.htm">PSYCHOUT
    FOR MURDER</A></B> and actual normal world films like <B><A HREF="damien_omen_2_1978.htm">DAMIEN:
    OMEN II</A></B> and such shit). Rossano is your every day average 
   rich guy living in a huge villa with his son, his niece, and his 
   borderline insane henchman who spends a lot of this film screaming 
   and gibbering.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    From naked wood-running girl's point of view, everything is great 
   until Electra shows up. When she does, it's clear that Franz, 
   Brazzi's son, is madly in love with her, what with the flirting and 
   the interminable giggling from Electra. Then again, Brazzi also seems 
   to be in love with her, and therefore an unspoken love rival issue 
   appears between father and son (and insane henchman, who releases all 
   the horses from their stables while screaming at the top of his 
   voice, which he'll do again and again throughout the film). Somehow, 
   the jealous father wins, and Electra agrees to marry him, prompting 
   Franz to vanish for a while and also prompting the henchman guy to 
   have a hilarious meltdown in the kitchen while smashing loads of eggs 
   but at the same time seemingly screaming and mixing some nice pancake 
   mix at the same time.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Electra, for whatever reason, is up for a bit of honeymoon sex, and 
   this is when Brazzi's chronic flashback syndrome goes into overdrive, 
   when he simultaneously has sex with Electra while flashing back to 
   not one, but two different sexual encounters with his first wife, who 
   died while giving birth to Franz, whom Brazzi blames for her death. 
   That's harsh, but what's also harsh is Electra's realisation that 
   Brazzi is out of his mind and thinks that Electra is his first wife, 
   which he does by referring to things that happened back then with 
   her, which causes Electra to freak out and placate him by playing along.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Now, from watching this film I'm going to give out this piece of 
   advice to potentially cuckolding lovers out there. If you absolutely 
   have to make goo-goo eyes at each other across a room, please make 
   sure that the spouse, who is being cheated on, is not sitting 
   directly in the middle of your field of vision, and is not, at that 
   precise moment, cleaning their gun collection. I know this is common 
   sense for most people but in this film it's okay to cheat on husbands 
   directly outside of villas in full view of every single person in the 
   villa. Although that does lead to a funny bit where Brazzi plays 
   dominoes with three people who aren't there.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As if the crazy dialogue, flashback attacks, and colour filters 
   aren't enough to alert you that Renato Polselli was involved, there's 
   also the ending, where every possible thing that could have happened 
   happens. I think if figured it out, but it sure is the weirdest part 
   of what already was a pretty weird film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">We
    can all agree that Edwige Fenech is the type of woman for whom you 
   would crawl for three miles over broken glass just to poke matches in 
   her shit, but I don't know if I can sit through another one of her 
   crappy late sixties films where not much happens.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The moral compass on this one is way off as we see that Edwige is 
   not really the niece of gold-digger Michelle, but her daughter. Why 
   this deception is in place, I don't know, but maybe it's to convince 
   potential rich sugar-daddies that Michelle hasn't got a vagina like a 
   burst couch due to child birth. Michelle is convinced that Edwige is 
   an innocent student, whereas we get clued in on Edwige not only 
   taking part in sexy photo shoots, she also part of the old 
   gold-digging business herself, with a nice attentive doctor under her 
   thumb. As well as loads of annoying hippy friends who stink up both 
   her house and the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Michelle's current lover takes ill while in bed with her (he's 
   loving it, and she's going on about a forthcoming holiday in 
   Acapulco), Michelle has to look elsewhere, finding a rich billionaire 
   Count and his bed-hopping son. She's into the son and thinks Edwige 
   can distract the dad, but it soon becomes clear that the son is more 
   interested in Edwige. I think. It was hard to keep track of things 
   while rummaging around looking for Kleenex and pausing the film every 
   two seconds when I detected footsteps approaching the living room door.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The thing is, this film kind of sets thing up for Edwige to discover 
   that tricking men into loving her is a foolish task and that only 
   true love can lead to happiness, but then goes down the route of 
   gleefully following Edwige's sociopathic tendencies as she pretends 
   to get involved in an orgy in a hot tub (that was a good bit), 
   pretends to overdose on hashish (what? A Snickers bar and some diet 
   coke would have sorted her out) then, stunningly, pretends to have 
   attempted suicide in order to get the rich count's son to propose to 
   her - which works without any negative repercussions! Good lesson 
   taught there then.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Not as erotic as I was led to believe, although it did seems to be 
   cut in places, Madame and Her Niece does contain plenty of Edwige 
   flesh, pouting, and whatever it is she does with her eyes, but the 
   character she plays in the film is a spoilt brat always with the eye 
   on the money, so it's hard to feel anything but contempt both for her 
   and for yourself after you've knocked one out to the hot tub scene.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   of my hips while I sat there wearing a Santa t-shirt five times too

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">This
    film starts off promising enough, with a pregnant Camille Keaton 
   being chased through a misty forest by a bunch of witches wearing 
   coloured wigs, with eyes the same colour. They torment Camille for a 
   bit until she sees the burning wreckage of a race car with the dead, 
   smouldering body of a racing car driver next to it before they carry 
   a coffin containing a baby doll in front of a distraught Camille 
   before throwing that on the fire too. While it burns, Camille sees 
   visions of medical staff saying that something 'is dead'.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even though it turns out to be a dream, that's an awesome start to 
   the film. Turns out Camille lives in a huge villa with Silvano 
   Tranquilo, although their relationship isn't really clarified, there 
   is some sort of emotional connection there. Confusing matters is 
   Camille's behaviour - she seems to be able to wander around freely in 
   Rome, glancing jealously at pregnant women, and picking up 
   hitchhikers to shag back at the mansion while Silvano spies on them. 
   In his spare time, Silvano reads books about the human psyche, stares 
   into space, and randomly teleports in his garden, seemingly only to 
   freak out his staff.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To confuse things further, the guy who seemingly died in Camille's 
   dreams turns up at the house as Silvano's son and immediately gets 
   into Camille's pants (at least it seems this way. I had to watch this 
   film relying only on my dodgy command of Italian. They do go for a 
   topless horse ride about five minutes after meeting and I did pick up 
   that this guy says 'by the way' an awful lot). However, despite the 
   promising start, quite a lot of what happens post-dream is drowned in 
   an awful lot of dialogue (although you do get to see Camille Keaton 
   naked if she floats your boat. At least it's consenting plot-wise, 
   unlike that <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave.htm">I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B> 
   shit). It takes about forty minutes of sex and dialogue for the 
   weirdness to kick back in, when things from Camille's initial dream 
   start creeping into her waking life.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I suppose things perk up a little when the hitchhiker turns up for a 
   party with girlfriend Paola Senatore, at which she goes nuts and 
   performs are rather lengthy but not unwelcome striptease. This also 
   confuses things, because just when Camille and Paola are just about 
   to get it on, Silvano interrupts, dismisses Camille, then gets it on 
   with Paola. When the hitchhiker finds out, he starts beating on 
   Silvano, who (it looks to me) hypnotises him into killing himself? 
   Man, I bet David Lynch is kicking himself for not having thought of 
   half the stuff that happens in this film. Wait - is it too late to 
   say &quot;Spoilers&quot;?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm not going to spoil the twist at the end, however, and although I 
   found it quite fitting, I'm sure some would kick in their 
   televisions. That aside, this isn't a total failure from the director 
   of <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Kong Island">KONG ISLAND</A></B>, 
   although you think it would be if you've ever suffered through that 
   crap. If you can make it through the dull middle section, there's 
   enough nudity and weirdness here to warrant at least one watch. After 
   watching this, I do understand why it only exists in Italian language 
   only form. There's probably not enough strangeness here for anyone to 
   make the effort to add subtitles.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    By the way (or approposito, as they say in Italian), I've noticed 
   there's a tendency for certain Italian actors to be pigeonholed into 
   certain roles. If you want a suave rich guy, you go for Silvano 
   Tranquilli. If you want an academic type or a member of the clergy, 
   you go for Umberto Raho. Rough diamond type? Giampiero Albertini. 
   Rapist? <A HREF="luciano_rossi_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Luciano Rossi</A>.

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">On
    the IMDb, this film's genre has been tagged as Crime, Horror and 
   Music. The keywords on the site also include Giallo, Eurospy (not 
   sure about that one), and banana. The banana bit I get, because it's 
   part of one of the main unintentionally funny bits in this 
   all-over-the-place film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This one off feature by Cesare Rau starts with two separate plot 
   strands that come together about halfway through the film. Our first 
   and most important part involves Thomas Hunter as part of a trio of 
   guys who escape from an insane asylum. Thomas seems pretty sharp at 
   first but it slowly gets revealed that he has a real problem with 
   women and is totally cracked out of his gourd. The other two guys 
   don't matter much to the plot, because one is captured by the police 
   and the other guy gets struck by a car while Thomas goes to ground.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The other plot involves your usual bunch of late sixties/early 
   seventies hippy types, out for a good time. It was hard to keep track 
   of them to be honest but I think there were four women and three 
   guys, one of which is particularly hands-on and eager to get it on 
   with the ladies. In particular, he's got eyes on a foreign lady who 
   gets roped in to joining everyone else at a remote villa, where our 
   old lunatic pal Thomas ends up too. That doesn't happen for a while 
   though, because we've got to spend time watching some lady getting 
   dumped in a nightclub first, which provides us some laughs. You see, 
   the print on Youtube is jumpy as hell, so when we see the band on 
   stage playing the song <A HREF="madness_the_eyes_of_the_moon_1971.htm#OST">&quot;She's
    A Stranger&quot;</A> (and you'll be hearing that a lot), the lead 
   singer's flute is suddenly replaced with a guitar, which now sounds a 
   lot less funny now that I've typed that out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anyway, Thomas takes his sweet sweet time getting to that villa, in 
   the meantime hiding from the cops, nearly strangling a prostitute, 
   fixing a guy's car (why put that in there?), then stabbing to death 
   the woman who got dumped in the nightclub in a pretty realistic 
   murder scene. Until the actress starts blinking. When Thomas finally 
   gets to the villa, he breaks in, finds no food but then finds a 
   squeaky banana that he finds funny for about three seconds before he 
   gets angry with it and throws it away before finding a wooden 
   crocodile which he seems more fond off. This film does get rather 
   bogged down in details that have nothing to do with anything.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Strangely, the tone of this film is more in line with an Eighties 
   slasher than a giallo, at first. A bunch of young(ish) people turn up 
   at a house to get wasted and have sex, and there's already a 
   murderous psycho in the house spying on them. While Thomas is 
   upstairs eating food he nicked while everyone was picking fruit, the 
   others get wasted as one of them pours LSD on some sugars cubes and 
   gives them out. Or maybe it was Polio vaccinations, because I 
   remember being given that on a sugar cube when I was a kid, but now 
   this film has got me worried that the nurse gave me LSD as a kid for 
   a laugh. Anyway, to prove that the actors involved here aren't very 
   convincing as groovy hipsters (the dancing scenes are painful), they 
   also give us a pretty unconvincing scene where they act like they are tripping.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, the foreign girl lies dead, strangled, but who killed 
   her? I'm not saying, but be assured that the characters here make 
   plenty of stupid decisions, and we get a 'final girl vs killer' 
   sequence which is also very much in line with an Eighties slasher. 
   There's also the slight giallo element of who killed the girl, and a 
   couple of bizarre, and funny choices by the director to have a 
   sequence where a character has a flashback with a slowed down version 
   of the 'She's A Stranger' song (struck me as funny, anyway), and an 
   even stranger Benny Hill final shot of a couple driving a car that 
   made no sense either.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giallo? Thriller? Banana? Who knows. Strange though, and 
   entertaining. Short too. This is so rare it didn't even appear on my 
   obsessive 'to watch' list that I've been keeping since 2017. I'm just 
   some guy who watches these things, but who are the people that have 
   these films? What else is out there for discovery?</FONT></FONT></P>

   needn&#146;t worry. Yes, the only shots fired are at the start of the 
   film, and the film is nearly two hours long, but the plot and the 
   acting of those involved drew me into the story. Franco Nero comes 
   across as a young, na&iuml;ve and ambitious cop who will stop at 
   nothing to get the biggest catch, but his faults also gradually start 
   to shine through and erase his self-confidence. I&#146;d say Claudia 
   Cardinale stands out the most though, as the desperate mother who 
   doesn&#146;t even know if her husband is still alive, with even the 
   police trying to manipulate her, out on her own just trying to tell 
   the truth. Lee Cobb was also good as the over-confident Mafia boss 
   who struts around in front of the police like a rooster with his 
   first hard-on.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   shows you how difficult a job the police have in rooting out the

   playing games with people, watching them having sex in her attic, 
   having rich people discussions about the church at parties, and 
   breaking up close friendships. This latter reference is the focus of 
   the film, as the Countess leads a communist trio of friends to one

   especially when the much-anticipated letter contains only the words 
   'Make the Chicken Legs Sleep'. The arrival of a stranger at the

   up to society, especially in our age, when people are so ready to

    never been to Sicily, but it's been covered on television enough 
   times for me to know that the food looks good (apart from that deep 
   fried cartilage they sell), the weather is real nice and there's some 
   good history and scenery there. Going by this film, however, it could 
   well be that the Mafia will just stick my name on a hit list for no 
   good reason whatsoever, and therefore I may be gunned down in the 
   street. I've told my kids that if this happens, it's what I would 
   have wanted.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Giuliano Gemma is a reformed car thief who makes a living selling 
   coffee from a little kiosk in Palermo. One day, his friend, 
   bagsnatcher Tano Cimarosa (who directed the sleazy giallo <B><A HREF="reflections_in_black_1975.htm">REFLECTIONS
    IN BLACK</A></B>), grabs his arm and shows him a guy sipping an 
   espresso in a cafe. This man, Tano tells him, is a hitman for the 
   Mafia, and he's just asked where he can find Gemma. Gemma isn't as 
   panicked by this as Tano, but they follow the hitman anyway...all the 
   way to Gemma's kiosk, where Gemma's son is watching over things.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gemma confronts the hitman (played by Michele Placido), but Placido 
   just claims he wants a drink and goes on his way, shortly before two 
   gangsters show up to collect their protection money from Gemma. We 
   see these two go back to their headquarters and hand the money to 
   Nello Pazzafini, who has about one line of dialogue before Placido 
   appears and kills both him and one of the gangsters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Something bad is going down in Palermo, all due to the kidnapping of 
   the wife of a lawyer who worked for the ruling Mafia clan. Worse 
   still, she was being held in a building right next to Gemma's kiosk, 
   and the kidnappers were customers of Gemma. Kind cop Luciano 
   Catenacci, another customer of Gemma, brings Gemma into the place to 
   show him a corpse, but Gemma doesn't know that particular guy, 
   stating that he only ever brought coffee over and barely set a foot 
   in the place. However, that simple cup of coffee is now going to turn 
   Gemma's life upside down.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's a list of eight names and Gemma's name is on there, as well 
   as other prominent Mafia types from a rival gang. Placido is also out 
   to get him, but is such a downright twisted individual he's decided 
   to play around with Gemma first. He says he wants two million lire in 
   order to call off the hit, and the race begins for Gemma to raise the 
   money, if he can even trust Placido in the first place. Finding two 
   million lire isn't going to be easy for a man with two kids who sells 
   coffee all day, but then there's those car-stealing skills that were 
   retired after a stint in jail...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's all personal opinion in the end, but for me <B>A MAN ON HIS KNEES</B> 
   is lesser Damiani, although that doesn't mean it's crap. The acting 
   all round is solid as usual, from Gemma's subdued everyman trying to 
   think his way out of a bad situation to Eleanora Giorgi as his 
   long-suffering but loyal wife to Tano Cimarosa as the faithful 
   sidekick. Michele Placido stands out as the hitman who will literally 
   do anything to get his own way - lie, beg, blackmail, threaten, cry - 
   anything at all, including using his own mother in scams and holding 
   a gun to a child's head. Placido plays it perfectly (if rather loudly 
   at times), throwing cowardice, malice and friendliness into the same 
   scene. By the end I wasn't even sure that the last thing that 
   happened wasn't some sort of trick. I'd imagine that's what Damiani 
   was going for.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The problem is, it's a little wordy in places, like it contains 
   things that could have been cut down a little, dialogue wise, and 
   although other Damiani films include some action to balance things 
   out, this one didn't quite have enough, concentrating more on 
   Placido's extorting of money from Gemma and Gemma's attempts to raise 
   funds. Still well worth a watch though, because there are plenty of 
   scenes of tension and a couple of twists in the end.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Love
    isn't just blind - it's deaf, stupid, sullen, moody, tearful, 
   annoying and nuts too. Franco Nero proves this in Luigi Bazzoni's 
   tale of how moronic a man can act when presented with a prize chick. 
   Why am I getting that 'I hope my kids don't read this' vibe already? 
   I haven't even used the phrase 'hooked through the sack' yet!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Franco is just your run-of-the-mill conscripted soldier, and 
   although we're given a flash-forward of a teary-eyed Nero being 
   pursued by some mysterious men, when the film proper starts he's 
   guarding a factory that chooses it's workers on a daily basis. The 
   day's workers have been chosen, but the gypsy girl with the huge 
   brown eyes wins him over. Her name is Carmen and Franco has around 
   ten seconds to bask in her beauty before she gets into a fight on the 
   workshop floor and stabs up a fellow worker for calling her a whore. 
   Which she actually is by profession.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Franco however is so head over heels in love already that he allows 
   Carmen to walk ahead while escorting her to prison allowing her to 
   escape, which leads to him being jailed for a bit. Carmen then begins 
   playing Nero like a sucker, declaring love for him while he's on 
   guard duty so that her fellow gypsies can rob the place he's 
   guarding, whispering sweet nothings in his ears then going off to do 
   a bit of loving with senior officer Franco Ressel before Nero 
   accidentally kills him in a fight.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nero and Carmen are on the run by this point, and talking of making 
   enough money to head off to the US, but everyone in the audience 
   knows she's talking bollocks. Nero is so hooked through the sack he'd 
   believe anything by this point, but at least he strikes up a 
   friendship with fellow gypsy Alberto Dell'Acqua, who accidentally 
   reveals that Carmen's husband has just been released from jail, and 
   will be taking part in the forthcoming stagecoach heist Carmen has 
   talked Nero into leading. I wasn't sure if Nero was acting shocked 
   that Carmen had a husband or was more shocked to discover that he was 
   custard cousins with Klaus Kinski.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Naturally, Klaus is playing a character that is a total dick and the 
   stagecoach robbery goes tits up, leading to the final third of the 
   film that I won't reveal, but as you would imagine, nothing will 
   deter Nero in his unshakeable faith in his love for Carmen, and her 
   perceived love for him, which leads to an awful lot of crying from 
   Nero. You see that beach scene near the end? That's not the sea - 
   that's a soundstage comprised entirely of Nero's tears!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This may be one of the few Spaghetti Westerns actually set in the

   last film of his I had to track down. His flare for stunning 
   cinematography (a duty carried out by his brother Camillo) stands out 
   in this film, with his penchant for shooting backlit actors well to 
   the fore, only most of the time the backlighting is done by the sun. 
   There are also some stunning images here, like Nero and a gypsy 
   friend (the only one who gets a happy ending) having a discussion on 
   a beach filled with huge anchors. Could have done without the 
   bullfight scenes though - but I suppose that was meant to be symbolic.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    However, that doesn't mean that this film isn't not stupid, because 
   the man who doesn't want to die in the film <B>THE MAN WHO DIDN'T 
   WANT TO DIE</B> is a rapist, and the way the film plays out, he's 
   supposed to be the guy that we the audience root for. You see, it all 
   starts off with a seriously injured guy being found naked and taken 
   to hospital. He can't speak but he can move, grabbing a junior 
   doctor's wrist like &quot;he didn't want to be left alone&quot;. 
   Sounds like a good mystery has just been set up, right?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Well, don't get used to it because Bava basically immediately 
   explains what happens by showing us that this guy was part of a five 
   man team put together by a rich lady to rob a fancy household of all 
   their expensive goods, including a Renoir painting. Things are going 
   well, with the security guy and his wife getting tied up and shifted 
   out of the road, but rapist guy has his eyes on the lady, and only 
   takes enough time out to steal the Renoir picture for himself before 
   returning his attention to her. I couldn't tell if he was going to 
   sell it or knock one out while looking at it - he did seem pretty 
   turned on with it. He hides the painting in a shed on the premises 
   and then attempts to rape his captive, only for her husband to kick 
   him in the back of the head and crack his skull.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    My first thought was that the rapist must have had very thin bones 
   for a shoe to break his skull, but you've got to kind of go along 
   with these things I guess. He can't speak or move, but just kind of 
   rolls his eyes around like he's trying to do an impression of Klaus 
   Kinski. Gang leader Fabrizio isn't too happy about this, pointing out 
   that it wouldn't have happened if he wasn't an idiot, but later 
   events would prove that Fabrizio isn't exactly going to be invited to 
   join MENSA any time soon. Still, they wrap the rapist up in a carpet 
   and dump him in the back of the van while Fabrizio has to murder the 
   guard and his wife.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Long story short - the rapist gets dumped in the woods, the gang 
   have to try and kill him in hospital, the rich lady discovers the 
   Renoir missing and the police link him to the murders, and 
   then...things somehow inexplicably jump forward a few months so the 
   rapist is well and walking around freely. I guess Bava just wanted to 
   get some giallo action in there because someone starts killing the 
   gang one by one, including a murder that would involve blindly 
   knowing someone's location inside a large shipping vessel, then being 
   able to drop a huge metal object inside the boat over the exact place 
   that person is located, several floors down. To be honest, the film 
   needed more scenes this daft. I won't go on about the giallo part of 
   the film, save to say there's about three people to choose as the killer.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At least the plot zips along quicker than some Bava films, but who 
   cares about a rapist? It's hard to create suspense for a character 
   you'd like to see killed anyway. I did like that Fabrizio's mother 
   has an eating disorder and he constantly has to bring her cakes and 
   sweets while she emotionally blackmails him, but that's as far as 
   character development goes for this one, apart from trying to paint 
   the rapist guy as a bad boy gone wrong in order to generate some 
   sympathy among the five or six viewers this film is going to have.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Basically, if you've heard of this film and know how low Italian 
   films sank in the late Eighties, you've basically watched this film 
   without watching it.</FONT></FONT></P>

    There seems to be some sort of message buried in Alberto Cavallone's 
   mental <B>MAN, WOMAN AND THE BEAST</B>, but I'm having a bit of 
   trouble working out what that is. In fact, I get the feeling that 
   there are many messages and themes in the film, be it from some sort 
   of commentary about the hypocrisy of people who outwardly appear good 
   and follow religion but indoors act out their basest human desires, 
   or that humans, despite their outer layers of socialising, 
   ceremonies, and dancing, are all just smelly animals that fart and 
   crap everywhere. It might be some attack on religion in general, 
   considering the jaw-dropping act performed at the end of the film. Or 
   it just might be that Alberto Cavallone wanted to film loads of sex 
   and crazy crap and call it an arthouse film. He did go on to direct 
   porn in the eighties, including the film <B><A HREF="baby_sitter_1982.htm">BABY
    SITTER</A> </B>(<I>You're killing me, Steven! - Fred</I>), where a 
   student is asked to look after a kid who turns out to be a sex-crazed 
   dwarf (It's out there on the internet if you look hard enough). 
   Cavallone died at the age of fifty-nine after having wanked himself 
   to death.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Plot isn't something that this film is overly concerned about. It's 
   more about a bunch of stuff that happens to some people in a town 
   that is celebrating some sort of patron saint. I suppose the main 
   focus is on a communist fellow who does collages of naked woman and 
   medical journals. It's weird enough when the film opens with this guy 
   dreaming of watching himself being dug up from a grave, but when he 
   wakes up to see his wife sitting on a potty, peeing and staring at 
   him, I guess that's the point you'll decide whether or not to bail 
   out of this one, or maybe a couple of minutes later when she eats her 
   dinner in the toilet and drinks toilet water. Or a few minutes after 
   that when the local butcher gets so turned on by watching the local 
   teenage girls that he goes back into his shop and shags a beef 
   carcass that was hanging in the back!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We also get introduced to the farmer guy after a prolonged, detailed 
   scene of a cow giving birth. He's a total dick to his wife, who is 
   fed up making him fried eggs and dreams of a better life. Some solace 
   in that department arrives in a Jesus like drifter who gets involved 
   with most of the characters in this film, be it becoming a hero to 
   the local kids, shagging most of the female cast, or the last scene, 
   which...I'll get to later. I can't remember if we first meet him via 
   the pervy cop who likes to hang out with the local hooker (whom 
   Jesus-guy also gets to do some horizontal bopping with), or if it's 
   via the daughter who's leaving town because her dad got her pregnant 
   while the two of them were sitting next to her grandfather's corpse. 
   At her instigation! I've got to admit that the look of guilt on Aldo 
   Massasso's face is priceless, and that this film is so dirty, one of 
   the actors has the word 'ass' twice in his second name.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This frankly ridiculous film just keeps zapping at you with the 
   obscene imagery and madness that some of it comes across as 
   (possibly) unintentionally hilarious. There's a drunken night of 
   debauchery where a woman lies naked on a billiard table and a guy 
   pots a ball up her fanny, which means that Lucio Fulci probably stole 
   that bit for <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SodomasGhost">GHOSTS OF SODOM</A></B>.
    Also, to quote Stephen King's book The Regulators, &quot;I don't 
   know who the other two are but the one in the middle looks like 
   Willie Nelson.&quot; You can see why the general intended message of 
   this film can get lost when grown men do running headbutts at one of 
   those 'see how hard you can punch' machines or there's a painting of 
   a woman only with tits for eyes and a fanny for a mouth. Or when a 
   guy is performing a bit of cunning linguistics on a lady only to turn 
   around and have what looks like half her pubic hair stuck to his 
   lips. I was pissing myself laughing at those bits, and the bit where 
   the communist guy did a photo montage that made it look like a naked 
   lady was giving birth to a fully grown Vladimir Lenin. It was just as 
   well no one walked in while I was laughing, because I'm not sure my 
   daughter would have found it funny to see a cow's eyeball hanging 
   from a fanny. I did though.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    All this, and the many other bits I've either forgotten or not 
   mentioned on purpose, is like a pleasant afternoon tea with your 
   grandparents compared to the ending, when Jesus gets it on with the 
   communist's crazy wife. Now, it's going to be hard to describe this, 
   but during the act of tender, sweet love, she suddenly craps into the 
   guy's mouth. Fake or not (I'm going with fake for sanity reasons) I 
   have never been so glad to be watching a washed out, blurry copy of a 
   film in my life. Mercifully, the film ends shortly after. Either that 
   or I passed out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So there you have it. It's one of those films I guess where you can 
   write endless bollocks about Grand Guignol and dadaism and such like, 
   or you could just laugh at how far out there this film goes to 
   offend. People compare this to Pasolini's <B><A HREF="salo_or_the_120_days_of_sodom_1975.htm">SALO</A></B>,
    but I wouldn't know because that looks like a right load of crap. 
   Maybe that's Cavallone's message - outrageous arthouse films are a 
   load of crap force fed to the audience.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">You
    don't get that many films about World War One in comparison to World 
   War Two, and you certainly don't get a lot of films about Italy's 
   involvement in the War. The Alpine Front sounds just as a horrible 
   and nasty as every other front. Better scenery I guess, but I'm sure 
   that wasn't a priority to the countless youths blown up or 
   machine-gunned in futile frontal attacks on machine gun posts.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's in the Alps the film takes place, although I'm unsure of the 
   exact year as there were about twenty battles pretty much in the same 
   area over the course of the war. The Italian Army has been ordered to 
   abandon a mountain, but is then immediately ordered to retake it. The 
   men are understandably upset about this, but General Leone won't 
   accept anything but courage from his men, even if it means making an 
   example of them over and over again. On the side of the men are 
   officers Pier Paolo Capponi and Gian Maria Volonte, who repeatedly 
   acts as buffers between the insane orders of the senior officers and 
   the crushed spirits of the men.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's not much background to many of the characters, and I think 
   this was done on purpose. All the infantry are burned out by the time 
   we meet them, and still they are thrown into battle over and over 
   again, until even the Austrian defenders beg them to 'turn back - 
   stop committing suicide'. The soldiers don't have a choice, however, 
   as their own machine guns are trained on their backs. It's death in 
   either direction and to quote from a British soldier involved in the 
   Battle of High Wood during the Somme: &quot;You had to go forward 
   because at least you had a chance to stick a knife in the person 
   shooting at you&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There are grumbles of rebellion among the soldiers, and as the 
   orders to attack despite little progress, who will even survive long 
   enough to rebel?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This realistic, horrific film is kind of like an Italian <B><A HREF="paths_of_glory_1957.htm">PATHS
    OF GLORY</A></B>, only with a bit more action (if you can call it 
   that when people are basically slaughtered). Both Volonte and Capponi 
   are pretty intense as the officers who know how futile the situation 
   is, and the whole film rolls along pretty quickly, just like the 
   never-ending attacks ordered by the top brass. The only female 
   character is Daria Nicoladi, who puts in a quick cameo as a nurse 
   tending to a wounded man following a particularly costly attack, 
   which also happens to be a turning point for a previously loyal soldier.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Don't expect a happy ending. There's also a nasty bit where a 
   soldier has his face totally destroyed and just kind of lies there 
   while Volonte screams for him to be given mercy.</FONT></FONT></P>

    The film starts with a prologue involving a stagecoach being robbed 
   by a load of men in drag, led by a leering Craig Hill . He takes 
   particular interest in the daughter of clothing salesman Pick 
   (Francisco Sanz, from several thousand other Spaghetti Westerns), 
   taking her to the side and raping her while his men laugh and taunt 
   her father.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Four years later, Pick and daughter Tony (Agata Lys - you'll have to 
   watch the film to find out why she's called Tony) return to the same 
   general area, hawking their wares in town. The sheriff of this 
   particular town bears a striking resemblance to the bandit who raped 
   Lys all those years ago. Pick spots this almost immediately, but who 
   do you go to if the man you want arrest is the head lawman? Maybe 
   that deputy who has it in for the sheriff, but there's other stuff 
   going on here too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most important of all is the recent murder of a mask-maker who was 
   murdered after creating a special mask for a client. Complete with 
   POV shots and everything, this guy gets a good old knife to the guts 
   before the black-gloved killer takes the mask and heads off. The same 
   masked killer also gets involved in a robbery and kills all his hired 
   goons straight after, but there'll be more killings and a very 
   lengthy chase scene before we find out who it is.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things are looking pretty bleak for the sheriff, and it isn't his 
   fault. You see, he's got a twin brother who loves robbing and raping 
   and he's back on the scene, seemingly in cahoots with the masked 
   killer. Looks like things are building up steam to a Halloween heist 
   complete with shoot-outs and guns that never run out of bullets, but 
   when do they ever in Spaghetti Westerns?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is Mario Bianchi's debut as a director, and not a bad effort at 
   that. Both the Giallo and Western elements are blended quite well, 
   including a scene with the killer moving around freely as the 
   townsfolk hold a masked ball to celebrate Halloween. He doesn't quite 
   get things to build up a full head of steam however, concentrating 
   more on the mistaken identity thing that involves Craig Hill playing 
   twins (not a spoiler by the way). He did better with his second film, <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#KillPokerPlayer1972">KILL
    THE POKER PLAYER</A></B>, with the mystery becoming the whole focus 
   of the plot. I'm not sure if Bianchi made another Giallo/Western mix, 
   because he's credited for directing over one hundred films and I 
   haven't got the time to track them down, so I'll never know if he 
   tried to blend Giallo with other genres, like his porno film <B>WORLD 
   CUP '90</B> (where nymphomaniacs help the Italian football team win 
   the World Cup by sapping all the energy of rival teams), his 
   historical murder-fest porno <B>THE CASTLE OF LUCRETIA</B> (where 
   someone on the IMDb has left a very detailed review to read), the 
   innocent sounding porno <B>AT HOME WITH PENIS</B> (the same guy's 
   left a review of that one too - he must look like a fucking boxer 
   crab with all the porn he watches), and <B>THE FLYING DOCTORS</B>, 
   which is not the Australian drama programme, but yet another excuse

    Back in the days of the caveman, it seems that instead of going out

   book and some Sun Ra on in the background, early man would spend his 
   Friday evenings worshipping a bear's head and pulling his enemies 
   brains' out of their decapitated heads to eat. Thus begins the story

   to escape the brain eaters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He's wounded though, so it's just as well a girl from another tribe 
   takes a shine to him and heals him, right before a bunch of guys come 
   to kill him. A bear, who we're going to see a lot of, steps in for a 
   playful fight too and rips off a guy's face. The rest think Buddy can 
   control the bear and put him in charge of the tribe, but this doesn't 
   last long as Buddy is giving yet another girl the glad eye, which

   take on the bear and Aldo Sambrell.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's no dialogue by the way, and, after a while, that's what bogs 
   the film down a bit. A love triangle thing develops between Buddy and 
   his two women, and its all kind of hard to keep track of everyone 
   when they look like Robert Smith from The Cure in a loincloth. Things 
   do eventually resolve themselves in a gory fashion that involves a 
   couple of brutal decapitations, a face gouging, a birth and a baby

   file it under the giallo genre, mainly due to the film containing back-stabbing

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ugo Liberatore brings us the story of Valerio, an Italian student 
   who has found his way into Oxford University, but isn't quite 
   settling in due to his fiery temper and the fact that British people 
   tend to cling to tradition like barnacles. Valerio could join the 
   Blues, Oxford's premier rowing team, and this would allow his various 
   academic shortcomings to be overlooked, but Valerio hasn't really 
   figured on the general xenophobia of the institution he's found 
   himself in. Or the fact that upper-class people are mental (believe 
   me, I'm saying this from experience! Not that I'm upper-class. I was 
   born in a council skip and actually dragged out by a rabid mongrel 
   dog who had rabies).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Valerio is known as one of the 'hearties' due to him being on a 
   rowing team, as opposed to the 'eggheads', of which John Steiner is a 
   part of. Problems arise in the form of Steiner's girlfriend Jane 
   Birkin, who has the hots for Valerio. When an attempt at sex is 
   rumbled by Birkin's mother (Rossella Falk, who also wants in on the 
   action with Valerio), Birkin's rage at rejection and Steiner's rage 
   at Valerio putting the moves on his girlfriend set off a tit-for-tat 
   battle where Johnny Foreigner isn't going to get one over on the 
   English establishment with their unseemly behaviour and genetic 
   insufficiency. It's like the whole Brexit thing boiled down to a 
   bunch of early Seventies hippies trying to one-up each other.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Although mostly interested in the dramatic aspect of things, Ugo 
   Liberatore (who directed the mental <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED
    IN VENICE</A></B>, which Fred covered very well) throws in a lot of 
   giallo tropes that keep things interesting. The film is very 
   colourful and the cinematography very fluid. People try and have 
   ordinary conversations while holding back the malice in their eyes. 
   At one point, Valerio walks in on his tutor (who is also Birkin's 
   father) brushing the long hair of a wig, suggesting he may be 
   trans-sexual. The whole film is full of little touches like this. 
   Plus, there's a very Beatle-esque soundtrack permeating the entire 
   film to compound the general contemporary feeling of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Best of all is Steiner as Roddy, monocle-wearing Roddy, who is set 
   up to be a racist student, but subtly comes across as a victim in the 
   whole tale of Valerio. He is presented as scheming (typical of a 
   Steiner character) but as the film unfolds it becomes apparent that 
   Valerio is just being a dick in general. He asks Steiner if he thinks 
   one of his mates is 'queer', to which Steiner answers &quot;It's none 
   of your business, nor mine&quot;, and later still Valerio tries to 
   generalise women as being all the same, prompting Steiner to call him 
   out once again. I love it when we get restrained John Steiner as 
   opposed to mental Steiner. In fact, the best bit of this film is when 
   Valerio has the chance to make up with Steiner, but ends up losing 
   his temper (again) and destroying all of Steiner's poems, so in 
   retaliation Steiner stands up calmly, grabs a book, a throws it 
   straight at Valerio's head, hitting him right between the eyes! I'm 
   guessing there wasn't much acting involved in the beating he receives 
   straight after this.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Good in comparison to other Umberto Lenzi films of that era, I must 
   add. At this point in the history of Italian cinema, we must take 
   what we can. He may have not plummeted to such depths as Lucio Fulci 
   with his <B><A HREF="sweet_house_of_horrors_1989.htm">SWEET HOUSE OF HORRORS</A></B>,
    but have you seen <B><A HREF="wartime_1987.htm">WARTIME</A></B>? 
   Jesus. Napier is a guy who has quit the FBI and headed to the 
   Southern part of the America's looking for his old buddy David 
   Warbeck, and on the way there he dreams some exposition where Warbeck 
   is wounded trying to stop some big bad drug dealer, who is then 
   killed, maybe, in a boat explosion. Get used to that because at least 
   three scenes involve witnesses being shot right before revealing a 
   major spoiler.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rumours are going around that Warbeck is on the take but when Napier 
   confronts Warbeck in an open patio area, Warbeck is quickly gunned 
   down by a bad guy (see what I mean? It also shows you that Napier's 
   character doesn't learn because it happens to another guy not much 
   later too.). Napier tries to make out that Warbeck and the other guy 
   killed each other, but this doesn't fool plucky young cop Rodriguez, 
   with his sexy young secretary Iris Peynado. Rodriguez think that both 
   Warbeck and Napier were into something together, and Napier's going 
   to have to prove that isn't the case, by punching Rodriquez in the 
   mouth and not shooting him or some shit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eventually, these two team up to find out what's really going down, 
   as it seems that the dead drug dealer isn't dead at all, but he has 
   had extensive plastic surgery, so there's a bit of a guessing game 
   going on in the plot as to who specifically is the bad guy, and 
   Napier's going to have to gun down a shitload of bad guys in order to 
   find out. And boff that secretary in his down time. Plus, also 
   convince her to go undercover as an escort girl so that she can get 
   the drop on the bad guys and be a nice hostage for the bad guys later

    It's your typical early ninties/late eighties action film to be

   and sexy ladies, plus despite being an old fart Napier can play quite 
   the tough guy. I don't know if Lenzi just retired or gave up on the 
   industry, but this is a decent enough film to go out on, so fair play 
   to him. Tragically, although Lenzi had a healthy retirement, he was 
   gunned down outside his apartment in Rome by the family of that

    Gdansk, a medium and his psychically sensitive wife make contact 
   with a much more powerful medium. On a beach, a dishevelled man wakes 
   up and heads for a strange house. A schoolteacher falls into a trance 
   and walks out of the school, leaving her class abandoned. A man on a 
   train disembarks at Sopot, but suddenly comes to and has no idea why 
   he is there. It's not a good time to be wandering either, as this is 
   the early Thirties, and there's a load of brownshirted bastards 
   kicking about who are part of the Hitler fan club.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Thus begins <B>MEDIUM</B>, which dumps a huge mystery not only on 
   the viewer's lap, but the characters trapped within. It turns out the 
   dishevelled fella is murder detective Selin, and it's not unusual for 
   him to wake up on the beach as he has a fondness for the old hooch. 
   His assistant, sudden Nazi-party member Krank, loves to tell his 
   superiors all about Selin's misbehaviour. He also likes to tell Selin 
   about the lady at the local museum who keeps complaining about a lady 
   who repeatedly steals a vintage dress, then brings it back, looking 
   confused. This turns out to be our schoolteacher.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The guy in Sopot decides to stay until he can find out what the 
   hell's going on, and the medium and his wife deduce that the more 
   powerful medium is controlling these people, but have no idea why it 
   happening or where this very powerful medium is located. Selin gets a 
   break (if you can call it that) when, upon buying fish food, the 
   sales assistant asks him to check up on the shop owner, who it turns 
   out lives in the strange house Selin entered at the start of the 
   film. Going inside, he finds the owner/medium seemingly dead on the 
   couch, and actor Jerzy Stuhr trying to escape, as it turns out he is 
   also being controlled, and has travelled all the way from Berlin 
   under the medium's control...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's enough plot! At first I couldn't understand why this had such 
   high praise on the IMDb as it unravels very, very slowly, but then 
   the mystery deepens as the film rolls on and the characters, 
   especially those the medium controls, start to either panic or find 
   their own ways to try and deal with someone who can seemingly reach 
   inside their heads and move them around like toys. The film focuses 
   mainly on Selin and his partner Krank, whom at first we're led to 
   hate, but then we end up kind of rooting for. He seems to drop his 
   attempts to get Selin fired and gets on board to unravel why the 
   psychic shop owner believes his life is linked with the turtles he 
   keeps in his shop, the history of the house, and the nefarious plans 
   as the medium wises up and starts controlling other people to stop 
   Krank. Selin goes from being motivated to horrified, the guy in Sopot 
   becomes more desparate, Jerzy Stuhr takes drastic action and the 
   schoolteacher...kind of gets forgotten. You see her arse though, so 
   maybe she was just toning that thing up a bit while the plot played out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>MEDIUM</B> goes from so laid back, it's in a diabetic coma, to 
   true horror, featuring axe murders and scary kids and is definitely 
   up there in terms of good Polish horror films. Some say its the best, 
   but I don't know about that. I'm looking forward to tracking down the 
   rest. The unique setting, doomy music, and Hitler backdrop (whom 
   Winston Churchill described in his books The Second World War as 'A 
   demon-genius from the abyss') make this one fairly unique.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Tony's a disgraced American cop now living in Genoa and working as a

   and ball-kicking at the hands of mysterious gangster Howard Ross. Cop 
   Adolfo Celi, from arty horror <B><A HREF="they_have_changed_their_face_1971.htm">THEY

   hanging around the port, and after a gentle cop beating Tony reveals 
   that he's trying to start a new life as a P.I, but has only one 
   customer - a rich chick called Mayar (Maud Adams). Maud has hired 
   Tony to find out who kidnapped her father, killed him, and run off 
   with the billion lire ransom money.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film basically rolls out like this: Tony uses his street 
   contacts to dig into the criminal underground, Howard Ross turns up 
   to kill him, Tony runs off, Adolfo Celi turns up at the crime scene, 
   and Tony gives him a phone call and they have a chat about what's 
   happening. At one point Adolfo tries to track down Tony but finds the 
   wife of Tony's landlord has tricked them because she was looking for 
   some sexy time with Tony, which leads to her being beaten by her 
   husband within earshot of Adolfo, who doesn't seem to give a shit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Tony discovers that the kidnapping has something to do with a dance 
   school where Yanti Somer is a performance artist (who dresses like 
   Annie Lennox from the Eurithymics), and that drugs are being smuggled 
   around the place, which leads Howard Ross to just flat out kill the 
   guy with a machine gun, leading Tony to try and quit his job. Mayar 
   won't let him though, and instead of quitting, Tony gets it on with 
   his boss, living the American dream.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The missing footage does kind of get in the way of understanding 
   what's going on, but to be honest it was still a kind of run of the 
   mill Eurocrime film with plenty of action to stop you getting bored. 
   A punch-up here and there, a car chase, a couple of gun battles, 
   Adolfo Celi vomiting up a milkshake, you know - the usual. The 
   strange things was the swinging from serious to comedy, as one minute 
   Lo Bianco is acting all goofy and care-free, and the next he's 
   injecting heroin so he can infiltrate some sort of drug smuggling 
   hospital type deal. Maybe.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The <A HREF="merciless_man_1976.htm#OST">funk-tastic music</A> was 
   outstanding though. Good acting all round as you'd expect from the 
   likes of Celi and Lo Bianco, fairly zippy plot, plentiful violence. 
   It ticks enough boxes to put it somewhere near the middle. There's 
   much worse out there (like <B><A HREF="dont_shoot_on_children_1978.htm">DON'T

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Surely
    by the time <B>MIAMI COPS</B> rolled out of the Italian movie 
   industry, Alfonso Brescia's score for directing films based in and 
   around the Bay of Naples was in triple figures? Here, he replaces 
   teary crooner Mario Merola with goofy Harrison Muller and Lucio 
   Montanaro's ear-piercing screaming with the laid back cool of Richard Roundtree.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This cheesy Eurocrime film doesn't start in Italy, mind you. It 
   starts in what I guess is Miami, even though it doesn't look like 
   Miami. In fact, we first get treated to a prologue where Harrison 
   Muller's cop father gets double-crossed and murdered by his partner, 
   which drives Muller into joining the cops to find his dad's killer. 
   That's a good enough premise, and having Muller play his own dad was 
   a good move too, as they just grey his hair up a bit and give him 
   glasses and a moustache. Muller snr puts in a good shift at the docks 
   taking down drug smugglers, but when his partner decides to keep the 
   cash and the drugs, it's curtains for dad.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As this is an Italian film, there's an undetermined amount of time 
   that passes before Muller joins the cops and is partnered up with 
   Richard Roundtree, whose nickname is PO (for Pissed Off). The rest of 
   this paragraph requests that you cast your mind back to any Eighties 
   film where a rooky cop is partnered with a salty veteran, because 
   that will save me the time of describing the initial interactions of 
   this odd couple. Basically, Muller messes up at a robbery, then earns 
   Roundtree's respect at a following kidnapping while also doing a 
   little undercover work to investigate his father's death. When Muller 
   rescues a guy who has been thrown into the sea (that either came out 
   of nowhere or I missed something), the two cops get their big break.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now, I thought that Muller's dad's murderer would still be part of 
   the cops, only older, but Brescia must have decided that things like 
   plot twists would just complicate the film a bit, so he just has the 
   guy from the prologue now occupying the island of Ischia, just off 
   the coast of Naples. This gives the two cops a chance to head over 
   there, which I'm guessing saved a bit of cash for Brescia by way of 
   location shooting. Around the same time, Muller also meets a young 
   girl studying the Etruscan language who seems to be everywhere Muller 
   wants to be, and yet his suspicions are not raised even once. Dumbass.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I might be suffering from a bit of Stockholm Syndrome from having 
   watched so many Alfonso Brescia films (Twenty-three at a rough guess) 
   but I didn't hate this film. It has that late-Eighties craptastic 
   charm that a lot of Italian films have from this era. The action is 
   steady enough, although haphazardly thrown together. The music is 
   that smoky saxophone style jazz we'd expect from any film produced at 
   this time, and Roundtree may be no Fred Williamson when it comes to 
   attitude and sass, but he still delivers. And, to be fair, his fight 
   sequences are much more convincing than Fred's <B><A HREF="black_cobra_series_1987-1990.htm">BLACK
    COBRA</A></B> stuff, where it looks like he's doing a bit of dad 
   dancing. If you know Fred Williamson, don't tell him that.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's a couple of car chases and even a bit of gore thrown in for 
   good measure. Plus, as we're talking Alfonso Brescia, there's that 
   blunt disregard for continuity, so you can witness Muller and 
   Roundtree emerging from the sea practically dry after swimming to 
   shore following a boat chase, or even see a corpse having a wriggle 
   around to make itself comfortable during a warehouse gunfight. Every 
   day's an adventure in the world of Alfonso Brescia. And that's my 
   review of Shaft in Ischia.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Luckily, director Raimondo Del Balzo pretty much fucks everything up 
   by not including much torture or violence against the women, and not 
   much revenge either. In fact, the entire first half of the film 
   doesn't contain any of that crap at all. It involves three girls 
   training for the Olympics, one of whom, if I may mention for no 
   reason, is training for the javelin event. These three are tired of 
   topless bathing at the beach with all their mates and want to go off 
   on their own to an Aunt's villa nearby. This they do, despite the 
   warnings of a more attractive team mate that doesn't get involved.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Off they go, and do whatever it is girls do in huge villas (I admit 
   to drawing a blank here so I might have passed out, or it may be that 
   literally nothing happens in this portion of the film). Whatever. In 
   the end the three girls head off to the beach to sunbathe topless and 
   run into three fellows - hunky, moustache wearing Antonio Cantafora 
   (from <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#ShadowIllusion1970">SHADOW OF ILLUSION</A></B>),
    rugged Giancarlo Prete (from weirdo art film <B><A HREF="long_night_1975.htm">THE
    LONG NIGHT</A></B>), and some other guy who has a pot belly and is 
   going bald (well, they can't all be winners I guess). Although fairly 
   put out that these fellas would be ogling the fat rascals on display, 
   the girls are easy going and invite the guys back to the villa.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things pretty much work out for everyone in the short term, as they 
   all hang about drinking, having knife/javelin throwing contests on 
   the beach, and moustache guy gets lucky with one girl in the shower, 
   and then in bed, in a scene that goes on forever. Turns out the other 
   girls are actually in a same-sex relationship, but thems the breaks 
   for the other two guys. Things take a turn for the worst when one of 
   the girls spies the front cover of a newspaper declaring a manhunt 
   for (etc etc - you all know this bit).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the guys discover that they've been discovered, they hold the 
   girls hostage, and...don't really do much else I guess. A bit of 
   glaring, Prete gets to watch one of the girls take a shower, then 
   there's some implied rape. It's all bollocks really. Nicely film 
   bollocks though, with a <A HREF="midnight_blue_1979.htm#OST">Stelvio 
   Cipriani score</A>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The revenge bit doesn't come to much either. I was taken aback by 
   the use of the javelin but once again, that's about it. There's a 
   scene at the end where the director seems to imply that all men are 
   rapists, but I was beyond caring.</FONT></FONT></P>

    The plot involves four artistic people who share a house together, 
   and what happens between them over the course of one night. I can't 
   be bothered finding out what their names are, but there's the very 
   French-Canadian actor guy, slightly less French-Canadian dancer lady, not-very-French-Canadian

    Now, over here in Scotland we have the Edinburgh Fringe Arts 
   Festival, where performing artists from all around the world flock to 
   show of their talents (or lack thereof, in about ninety-percent of 
   cases). This loud, screaming, expensive mess goes on for about a 
   month, but this year, like everything else, it's been cancelled due 
   to the Coronavirus. The plot of this film is what I imagine is going

    The characters in this film dance around their house while others

   naked on a stool with a megaphone covering his balls before asking 
   &quot;Is dinner ready?&quot; (It's not, but the dancer making it is 
   wearing a salad strainer on her head). &quot;I wonder what it's like 
   to be covered in banana skins?&quot; One person asks. Two of them 
   dress up as Ronald McDonald before the guy pretend rapes the woman.

    the director of the off-beat Eurocrime film <B><A HREF="flower_in_his_mouth_1975.htm">THE

   as comedy, but to me it didn't contain any more humour than Dario 
   Argento's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BirdCrystalPlum1970">THE BIRD WITH 
   THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE</A></B>. It's satire of the genre in the 
   beginning, but the ending to this film is one of the darkest I've seen.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Johnny Dorelli plays a divorced journalist who has never had that 
   one scoop that would send him to the big leagues. His desk at work is 
   situated right next to the office toilet, his ex-wife thinks he's a 
   failure, and only his son seems to respect him. In fact, when the 
   film opens both Dorelli and his son have just finished watching a 
   giallo in a cinema (decorated with posters for <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   and the great <B><A HREF="destruction_force_1977.htm">DESTRUCTION FORCE</A></B>),
    but then his son has to witness and argument between his warring parents.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At a low ebb, Dorelli attends work the next day to find a letter 
   sent to him by someone called The Monster, who says they are going to 
   kill a much-loved children's television personality (who is an 
   asshole in real life). When the grumpy old bastard gets his head 
   smashed in, Dorelli is first on the scene, doesn't take any pictures, 
   and gives the letter to the police. This does not please the owner of 
   the newspaper, nor his power-hungry son, so when he receives another 
   letter from The Monster about the next victim, Dorelli is ready to 
   record every aspect of the next murder, even to the detriment of the 
   intended victim, but the newspaper sales propel him up the ladder, 
   and the media magnate's son proves to be quite the exploiter...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>THE MONSTER</B> is a piss-take of journalism and the lengths the 
   media will go to in order to boost sales, but it's also a bona fide 
   giallo all the way through. There's a big Argento influence on the 
   film, with loads of quirky characters, like Renzo Palmer's lipstick 
   salesman whose business gets a boost from the killer using his brand 
   at the murder scenes. He also keeps turning up at various points 
   acting like he may be the killer, scaring the crap out of Dorelli and 
   his son. There's also a policeman who hates Dorelli's guts as every 
   crazy person in town strolls into the station to claim they are The 
   Monster, and is also driven nuts when Dorelli publishes a story about 
   a theory regarding where the killer plans to strike next.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's not overly gory, but giallo fans should enjoy the mystery here, 
   with plenty of clues and twists, and I've got to admit that the best 
   thing about the film is actor Johnny Dorelli, who is unknown to me - 
   he runs the whole spectrum from bitter and acerbic to smug, and when 
   the humour totally drops out of the film in the last twenty minutes 
   or so, numb and empty. Very good turn from that fellow.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Strangely, Ennio Morricone's soundtrack didn't really register this 
   time around, but I wonder if he wrote the song that Sydne Rome sings? 
   Who knows. Watch out for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from 
   professional ugly actor Salvatore Baccaro as a werewolf.</FONT></FONT></P>

    This is one of those giallo deals where a lot of people gather at a 
   remote castle so they can all be bumped off in gory fashion, but then 
   this film can't quite decide what direction it's going, so you get a 
   bit of Eurocrime thrown in too, and some Gothic action as well. In 
   the remote castle lives a crippled Baron and his mute, 
   taxidermy-obsessed son who suffers from GICMT (Or 
   Giallo-Induced-Childhood-Memory-Trauma). Visiting are the Baron's 
   daughter and various hipster types, including Greta (who looks like 
   Carla Mancini, but isn't Carla Mancini), another blonde girl, three 
   guys, two of whom seem to be involved in some sort of drug smuggling 
   racket which rather diverts the plot from the giallo action.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's also the hired help to be concerned with, which includes the 
   maid (who likes to boff the mute brother), a stern-faced butler type, 
   and a drunken doctor who seems to be pre-occupied with injecting 
   people with sedatives. Once this lot are together, the film settles 
   in as we watch various people pair off with each other, and now that 
   I think about it, not much of it has much bearing on the story. The 
   blonde girl who isn't the Baron's daughter hits it off with the drug 
   dealer guy, which leads to him getting a cheeky glint in his eye and 
   moulding a candle into a shape which is heavily implied to be rammed 
   up the girl's chocolate starfish. (<B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">NOTE TO FRED</FONT></B>:

    Post-coitally, this girl gets stabbed up and her eyes pulled out, as 
   well as her expensive necklace getting nicked. This prompts an actual 
   actor to turn up in the form of Corrado Gaipa (from <B><A HREF="illustrious_corpses_1976.htm">ILLUSTRIOUS
    CORPSES</A></B>, <B><A HREF="shadows_unseen_1972.htm">SHADOWS UNSEEN</A></B> 
   and some obscure film called <B><A HREF="godfather_1972.htm">THE GODFATHER</A></B>).
    Corrado goes into full Poirot mode and interviews everyone involved, 
   which is pretty entertaining until you realise it's eating into the 
   old &quot;Gloved killer murdering people&quot; time.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm serious. A lot of the more typical gialli involve set-piece 
   killings, one after the other. What we get here is competent police 
   investigation, followed by a crime sub-plot, flashbacks, and then 
   eventually some more giallo murders (about ten minutes before the 
   film ends). Strangely, I didn't think that was too bad a thing, as 
   the film also has the odd surreal sequence, like a stop-motion strip 
   scene, and a sex scene where one embalmed owl turns to have a better 
   look. When the murders do happen, they are gory, and there's plenty 
   of sex thrown in too, so there's not much to complain about here.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   more. First off, her boyfriend Alessandro (Gianni Macchia) is an 
   architect, but not a very good one, as we can see from the bollocking 
   contractor Tom Felleghy gives him on site one day. Guilia&#146;s plan 
   is to butter up the heads of the municipality of Modena in order to 
   get Alessandro a better job with more cash, and it seems that these 
   three fellows are corrupt to the core, scheming in their office and 
   getting the Church on board to boot. Just your usual day in Seventies 
   Italy then.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Guilia is also trying convince these guys to redirect a planned 
   motorway to her land in order to boost the price of it, but so far 
   Alessandro isn&#146;t getting anywhere and the planned motorway route 
   is staying as it is. The stalemate however will soon be broken by the 
   arrival of Guilia&#146;s younger sister Anna (Jenny Tamburi from 
   Fulci&#146;s <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE PSYCHIC</A></B>).
    Anna has returned unexpectantly from boarding school, taking Eva by 
   surprise, although that doesn&#146;t stop her getting it on with 
   Alessandro while Jenny spies on them (to be fair, she only wanted 
   some snacks from the kitchen).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's not long before it becomes apparent that Alessandro is becoming 
   more attracted to Anna, but he&#146;s not sure if this is 
   reciprocated (I&#146;d be confused too, as Anna leaves the bathroom 
   door open while standing in front of a mirror naked and runs up a 
   flight of stairs wearing a dressing gown and nothing else). This 
   starts to effect Alessandro&#146;s working life as he tries to vent 
   his frustrations on a willing secretary, but changes his mind at the 
   last minute.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At this point the plot seems to be heading in a pretty predictable 
   direction of Alessandro hooking up with Anna and scheming against 
   Guilia, but things go off on a tangent when, at a house party, we see 
   Guilia getting it on with one of the council heads in the garage and 
   Anna is gang-raped, leading to some characters in the film revealing 
   some very dark sides and Anna going from victim to aggressor, using 
   her wiles against her foes. But not in a <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave.htm">I

    With colourful, playful cinematography, experimental editing, a 
   whole lot of sex and nudity, <B>MORBIDITY</B> is a giallo without any 
   murders. There are some twists and turns, however. Guilia turns out 
   to be almost soulless in her pursuit of money, and Alessandro turns 
   out to be a more sympathetic character than what the plot builds him 
   up to be. Not the most riveting film however, especially in the first 
   half, but I believe Jenny Tamburi has her fans, so they&#146;ll be 
   pleased with this one.</FONT></FONT></P>

   kind of let roll over you. There's no blood or gore, not even a nude 
   body, but the entire atmosphere and tone of the film is fascinating 
   (and current too). The Castaway's incredulous investigation into the 
   island is pretty creepy, as he explores an abandoned landscape then 
   reels in terror as it comes to life, and John Steiner does well as 
   the arrogant and stoic Morel. You can't say the guy didn't diversify. 
   Sometimes the roles he picked were wrong, like the hilarious <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#DeportWomenSS1976">DEPORTED

    Now, Scotland is divided into various political and ideological 
   factions just now but they are easy to categorise - the Nationalists, 
   Unionists, Remainers and Leavers, but I have no idea how anyone in 
   Italy could distinguish between socialists, communists, The Red 
   Brigades, and whatever other left wing factions seem to be kicking 
   about there during the seventies and eighties. It may have easier on 
   them all just to do what I do - categorise people into two groups: 
   &quot;Annoying Arseholes&quot; and &quot;Less Annoying Arseholes&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These Red Brigades people are angry and shoot up a bunch of cops 
   when they grab Moro, taking him to a flat in Rome, chuck him in a 
   secret room (I'd love to have one of these - I wouldn't tell the wife 
   and kids about it either), then put him on trial for some sort of 
   crime. Moro's group are the Christian Democrats, who are 
   'centre-left'. I know nothing about Italian politics. Meanwhile, 
   Moro's colleagues in his party are running about like headless 
   chickens, trying to find him and caught up with their own agendas.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   ten years earlier. Here he plays Moro as a calm, almost resigned 
   person who seems to realise his fate far sooner than even the people

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">This
    kind of tame murder mystery is only really notable because it's set 
   in Switzerland and has Alida Valli enjoying psychedelic mushrooms 
   that fuels her artistic creativity. She also keeps a monkey in a 
   secret cupboard in her room, but if that bit was explained I missed it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The main character of the film is Dr Eric Calder, a man with enough 
   childhood trauma to fill about five or six gialli. You see, when he 
   was a kid, his mother used to abandon him all the time. To make 
   things worse, the Second World War was going on and his mother 
   couldn't even be bothered looking after him during a bombing raid. 
   Eric's got abandonment issues up the wazoo, so this doesn't help his 
   relationship with his young, free-living wife Anne, who is often away 
   filming commercials and leaving Eric to go crazy on his own. Both 
   these actors seems to have lengthy careers and may be well known, but 
   I cannot be arsed trying to spell their names correctly. It's bad 
   enough with the Italian ones.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The only things entertaining Eric is his medical practice and the 
   crazy antics of Alida Valli, who often calls him over to talk jibber 
   jabber about her art and get sleeping tablets off him. She also has a 
   little fancy for Eric, which annoys creepy son Gaetan, who might have 
   a bit of an Oedipus complex going on. There's also groundskeeper Kurt 
   who's also milling about the place, and it's easy for everyone to get 
   into each other's business as Alida insists that every door in the 
   house remain open at all times.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's when Anne works away overnight on their wedding anniversary 
   that sends Eric into a depression. Getting wasted, he receives a 
   phone call from Alida to get his ass over to her place. Sensing that 
   he might be in there, Eric agrees to share some crazy mushroom juice 
   with Alida, leading to a psychedelic sequence that only appear in 
   roughly ninety-seven percent of the films made around this time. The 
   next day, Alida has been strangled, Eric is back home, and his 
   memories of the night before are very hazy indeed...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is one of those films where the police are actually competent 
   enough to round up all the suspects and question them - Eric, his 
   maid, Gaetan, the groundskeeper, and when Anne returns from her trip, 
   she notices that Eric seems to be cracking apart at the seams and is 
   also the main suspect in the case. I guess that happens when someone 
   sends the police a note that says 'Eric is the killer'. And when Eric 
   lies about what he did that night.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The problem is that Alida Valli plays the most interesting character 
   in the film, and when she's gone, it's just a dull police procedure 
   with Anne also figuring stuff out while Eric goes crazy. It's not bad 
   or anything like that, but it needed something in there to boost the 
   energy levels a bit. Oh well. The mystery isn't that hard to solve 
   either and I didn't like Gaetan's haircut. Next!</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Man,
    it seems that as a pastime in Italy in the late sixties and early 
   seventies, folks were either involved in crime, political activism, 
   or hanging around in some villa, hotel, or mansion, playing mind 
   games with each until some sort of violent event occurs. Guess what 
   this film involves?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's the latter. Usually money motivates the psychological warfare 
   devious folk would wage on (mostly) Carroll Baker in these sorts of 
   films, but here, young Silvia seems to be messing with her folk's 
   head just because she wants to. Her parents, especially her father 
   (played by Massimo Girotti, most familiar for <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON
    BLOOD</A></B>), are stuck up, and don't know quite how to deal with 
   her. She's an ex-drug addict and has just returned from rehab in 
   Switzerland, but her parents aren't quite ready to bring her home, so 
   instead they are all holed up in a hotel in Sardinia. Silvia knows 
   that her parents don't want her to bring shame on the family by way 
   of scandal, and she plays up to that by messing with their heads, so 
   much so that they bring in psychiatrist Silvano Tranquilli to examine her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Silvano doesn't have much luck because Silvia messes with him too, 
   claiming that all the Roscharch images shown to her are nonsense. To 
   be honest, Silva comes across as a spoilt brat who may act brazen, 
   weird and confident, but hasn't quite figured out she's got major 
   daddy issues. Just before I was about to gouge my eyeballs out with 
   boredom, Peter Lee Lawrence (from the rather good giallo <B><A HREF="love_and_death_in_the_garden_of_the_gods_1972.htm">LOVE
    AND DEATH IN THE GARDEN OF THE GODS</A></B>) turns up as young guy 
   hiding out on the hotel grounds because, as he tells Silvia, he's 
   killed a woman and is on the run. Due to this being a film and not 
   real life, or possibly because it's the early seventies and young 
   people in cinema at that time are annoying subversive types, Silvia 
   thinks that's cool and the both of them hit it off...for about five 
   seconds before they start messing with each other's minds too. Is 
   love in the air or are other motives coming into play?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These films, where nothing much happens, seem to be ten a penny in 
   the sixties and seventies. Films where next to nothing happens for 
   the entire duration of the film. People have dinner together and 
   talk. People stand on beaches looking out to the sea and talk. They 
   hide in hotel rooms and talk. And what they talk is shite. Silvia 
   acts like such a smart arse. Going on and on about her father and 
   winding Lawrence up by leading him on then blowing cold with him (or 
   switching the lights off and blinding him with camera flashes). Who 
   was the intended audience for this film? It's not arty enough for the 
   arthouse crowd. It's not sleazy or bloody enough for the giallo crowd 
   (although I read somewhere that there were sex scenes that were cut 
   out of the film), there's not even enough drama to make it a soap 
   opera. It vaguely follows the late-sixties Lenzi film template, but 
   in the most bland, eventless way possible.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   things back when we were teenagers, but the whole notion of staying 
   in that life, killing for it and deeming it more important than your 
   own family is beyond me. Mind you, I stopped doing all that crap when 
   I was about fifteen and looked old enough to get into a pub, and we 
   didn't have all the cool stuff like guns, and rap music, and tattoos 
   (although I did know one guy who inexplicably had his own name

    <B>MY CRASY LIFE</B> claims to be about a Samoan gang from West L.A. 
   (they sure love referring to their geographical location in the L.A. 
   metropolitan area), but while watching it you start to get the 
   feeling that something just isn't quite right about it. The 
   interviews seem to be normal, where one gang member interviews 
   another, asking probing questions about how he would feel if his 
   family were killed by accident, how he feels about how he's treated 
   his mother, but there's entire sections of this film that come across 
   as at least partially scripted, and now that I've did a little 
   research, I've discovered that they were.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is most obvious when one gang member mugs a guy for his wallet, 
   but there's the two gang members who have left the 'hood to go and 
   work in Hawaii where it's also obvious there's some sort of script 
   going on, but this doesn't make the film any less watchable. It 
   probably helps in fact, because for all their talk of shooting things 
   and hitting up and such like, this lot spend an awful lot of time 
   sitting about playing cards and not doing much at all. Most of their 
   day seems to involve playing Trumps, drinking, smoking, shouting 
   &quot;Westside!&quot;, talking about the old times, shouting 
   &quot;Westside!&quot;, rapping, and shouting &quot;Westside!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's another parallel story where a Samoan cop takes an interest 
   in a gang-banger in prison and heads off to trace his family. This 
   doesn't really lead anywhere, but it does introduce the bizarre 
   narrative device of the psychopathic on-board computer that taunts 
   him constantly with a creepy voice. This judgemental computer seems 
   to imply that the cop has some sort of romantic interest in the 
   gang-banger, and then later also implies that the computer fancies 
   the cop. Usually this is set to some creepy music while the cop 
   patrols the streets at night. This generally pushes the film from 
   'documentary' territory to 'fucking weird' territory as this computer 
   seemingly looks down on everyone involved in the documentary and 
   basically acts like a mix between HAL from <B><A HREF="2001_a_space_odyssey_1968.htm">2001</A></B> 
   and Hannibal Lecter if he was in the prison cell next to you,

   attempt to drive you insane.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I don't claim to know anything about LA gang culture and I know even 
   less about Samoa, and the film, while entertaining, didn't quite

   and the very confused teacher who faces a lot of fallout in the 
   morning. Backing him up comedy wise is Carlo Croccolo as a private

   gives the old guy the come-on, and while he's pumping away the other

    Sandra and especially Olga are on him like ferrets, which almost

   Anton's eye. Deciding that a houseful of very strange people is a 
   great thing to experience, Anton settles down for a while with a view 
   to seducing Susan, but he gradually finds out that Susan doesn't 
   quite like to face reality so much, which is why things like murder 
   can take place almost right under her nose. In fact, the only person 
   who seems to know everything that's happening is crazy Pyit, whom the 
   girls mercilessly taunt. Pyit seems to seek vengeance for the man's 
   murder, even retrieving his body and keeping it in her shack. She 
   never utters a word for the entire film but kind of steals the show.

    This beautiful looking film is hard to categorize. The murderous 
   girls are portrayed as so joyously smug and evil that they seem to 
   constantly get off on winding everyone up and using their sexuality 
   to manipulate the men around them (although Anton manages to fend off 
   the more aggressive Sandra). This seems to be down to Susan, who is 
   so caught up in caring for the crazy Albert that she's become blind 
   to everything else going on around her, and with everyone getting 
   naked and getting it on every five minutes, it's like a soap opera 
   written specifically for Red Tube, or, possibly, just an everyday 
   Dutch soap opera that I happened to watch by accident.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's loads of nudity and an almost giallo-like use of colour 
   here, mixed with a David Lynch-style atmosphere. Apparently this Pim 
   De La Parra fellow is quite notorious, so I'll have to seek out more 
   films of his. For academic reasons, obviously. Which reminds me, 
   there's an awesome threesome bit in this film! Jeeves - pass the kleenex!</FONT></FONT></P>

   has a plot that unfolds slowly, and I'm kind of loathe to reveal too 
   much, so let's keep this brief.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Two guys who work on a boat for some rich dude reflect on their life 
   while their boss is onshore. One of them is innocently accepting his 
   lot in life as a guy who works on a boat, whereas the other guy is 
   smoking his bosses' cigars and drinking his whiskey. While he's doing 
   so, a young sexy lady randomly boards, looking to hire a boat for her 
   and her husband, Charles Van Eyck, a semi-famous diver. Our imposter 
   Daniel pretends he's the owner of the boat and ropes in his innocent 
   mate Santi along for the ride.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It becomes apparent very shortly that the Van Eycks don't get on 
   very well. She can't stand to have him touch her, and he can't stand 
   for anyone to get a look at the map he holds on his person and 
   secretly consults, but where is the map leading him and why is it 
   such a secret? I'm not saying, but Charles better watch out, because 
   his wife (if she is even that) is after what he wants, and she may 
   very well use her new friend Daniel to get it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Charles does a bit of diving but turns out not to be as ignorant as 
   he makes out, knowing fine well that his wife and Daniel may be 
   conspiring against him. That said, he doesn't reckon on getting his 
   head crushed in an accident, and it's when Charles bites the dust 
   that the real twists start revealing themselves, and I'm not going 
   any further to reveal them, so you'll have to seek out this film for yourself.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Containing a small cast in a very small location, it's impressive 
   how director Navarro manages to ring suspense out of nearly every 
   scene. You never quite know who trusts who or even what the whole 
   purpose of the sailing trip is all about, as it seems at first that 
   Charles Van Eyck is looking for some sort of treasure, but then it 
   turns out to be something totally different. It's hard to write about 
   this without majorly spoiling things though, so I'm saying nothing 
   more about the plot.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    For such an obscure film, the version I watched was in HD in

    politician Sergio is mooching about his apartment one night when he 
   spots some gangsters having a shoot-out with the cops. Things seem to 
   blow over pretty quickly, but when Sergio and other tenants go 
   outside to have a look, Sergio seems to be the only one who spots the 
   briefcase hidden under a car. Returning later in disguise, Sergio 
   retrieves the suitcase and finds it's filled with money - Three 
   billion lire in fact.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sergio hides the money in his apartment, but is shocked the next day 
   to open his shutters and find a dead body staring up at him, along 
   with cop Marcello Bazzuffi. Sergio keeps tight-lipped about the 
   money, and with his mate Paolo Malco, heads off the Switzerland for a 
   holiday with his family. On the way there however, two guys in 
   disguise hold Sergio at gunpoint and steal all his luggage, so who 
   has twigged that Sergio has the money? Whoever it is, they are going 
   to have to try a lot harder to get to the cash, because Sergio is a 
   lot tougher and stubborn than he looks.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While the film has a nice premise and looks all set to have Sergio 
   chased around for the cash, not much else happens for the remainder 
   of the film. Sergio goes to Switzerland, gets searched at the border, 
   stops to look at a dog, meets his family, talks to his wife, goes to 
   a dinner party, acts all huffy, goes off and stares at things, goes 
   up in the hills and stares at things. I began to wonder if I'd 
   stumbled onto some sort of drama instead of a giallo. Now and again 
   the film threatens to get exciting, then Sergio goes off and smokes a 
   cigarette and stares at something.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Some sort of plot eventually emerges in the last twenty minutes as 
   someone breaks into Sergio's apartment and a couple of twists creep 
   in, but this is an extremely low energy film, with little action or 
   plot. The only bit that's any good at all is the mind games that 
   Marcello Bazzuffi and Sergio play with each other as the cop tries to 
   get Sergio to crack about the money. Other than that, this film is a 
   bit of a waste of time.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I knew I was in trouble right away when I was greeted with a full 
   five minutes of shots from various angles of a woman's face, and then 
   the credits started. What followed was a hideously pretentious 
   cavalcade of mixed messages with some sort of commentary about 
   feminism getting mangled in the process. Plus, lots of zoom shots of 
   arses and an extremely dubious sub-plot about a teacher feeling up 
   the pupils.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sandra (I think that was her name) has been married to Claudio for 
   eighteen months and seems to be getting a bit antsy. Claudio on the 
   other hand is one of these hilariously over-stated sexist characters 
   that crop up from time to time in Italian cinema (for example Carlo 
   in <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StripNudeKiller">STRIP NUDE FOR 
   YOUR KILLER</A></B> or the gym instructor in Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Aenigma1987">AENIGMA</A></B>).
    When she arrives home one night, Sandra can't wait to tell Claudio 
   all about this exciting new political group that she's met, but he's 
   watching the football and can't be bothered listening to her, except 
   to comment that if someone is a woman they can't be intelligent, and 
   if they are intelligent they can't be a woman.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To further prove that he's one of life's good guys, Claudio is also 
   getting it on with a client he's met through his estate agency 
   business, a business that gives him loads of excuses to go off for 
   days on end. Unfortunately for him, someone has let Sandra in on the 
   secret, but rather than confronting him about it, she goes off an 
   jumps into bed with Melisa, part of the left-wing group and also a 
   teacher who likes to get it on with the pupils. This triggers one of 
   many flashbacks throughout the film (in fact, the film is one long 
   flashback, so there's often flashbacks within flashbacks) where we 
   see one of her pupils/lovers getting it on with an older man.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In fact, it might worth pointing out here that Melisa has many 
   complaints about her getting touchy-feely in school, but rather than 
   face any kind of consequence for her actions, she just blackmails her 
   boss into not saying anything about it and the plot just rolls right 
   on! You go ahead and molest those pupils, Melisa! That's messed up 
   right there. Luckily in Britain during the seventies our kids where 
   all safe in school, because all the paedophiles were working in 
   children's television and on radio at the time. Except that one guy 
   who was a teacher, then a weatherman.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You see, I thought this film was about how badly men treated women 
   and Sandra's voyage of self-discovery through free sex, drugs, and 
   shitty beatnik poetry, but by the time we'd had a bondage session, a 
   gang-rape, and whatever that crap was at the end with the pretend 
   orgy, I had no idea what the point of the film was at all. Plus, 
   don't get all excited about the bare arses and boobs and that - it's 
   all done in the most terrible way possible, with people just sort of 
   writhing about, nuzzling each other's necks. Also it's the seventies 
   so they all probably stank of shit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The director must have thought his film wasn't annoying enough and 
   therefore made only the prologue and epilogue in colour, with the 
   rest being monochromatic or black and white. That's probably why the 
   soundtrack was pretty much the same track played over and over again 
   too, just to wind me up just a little bit more. The whole thing plays 
   out like a misguided student film, albeit one where the director has 
   convinced the actresses to get naked. I need to watch something good 
   just to wash this one out of my mind.</FONT></FONT></P>

    The Mafia aren't doing much better as the old school try to hold

   the special squad do win one for the team), resulting in a rather 
   high mortality rate on both sides that provides surprise deaths and a 
   particularly grim ending. The whole thing looks like it was filmed

   so doubly worth the watch.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcello is in comedic mode in this film, playing a hard-up mandolin 
   player, playing to customers in restaurant on the coast of Naples. 
   Marcello's struggling for several reasons: he's suffering the effects 
   of polio, he's not that confident around women, and his father is 
   racking up huges debts with local mobsters. The latter has just got 
   Marcello into a lot of debt with a poker player called Giardino, who 
   offers him a seemingly simple solution - if Marcello plays a certain 
   serenade for him on the mandolin, all debts are cancelled. Seems too 
   good to be true, right?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Right. Giardino orders Marcello to follow a mysterious blonde in a 
   Volkswagen in his car, and to play the serenade wherever the car 
   parks. The blonde parks outside of a certain block of apartments, but 
   when Marcello plays the music, some guy appears on the top balcony 
   and starts firing a shotgun at both the blonde and Marcello, before 
   taking a dive off the balcony and falling to his death.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcello now has an accident prone cop (aren't they all in these 
   films?) on his arse, but then again, he gets to meet his idol, 
   conductor Victor (Michel Piccoli, who passed away in 2020). Victor 
   says he would like Marcello to play in his orchestra, but tasks him 
   first with seeking out who killed his assistant, the guy Marcello 
   witnessed dying the day before. Victor also has a sexy opera singer 
   wife who is the dead guy's sister, and she seem to have the hots for Marcello.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As does Ornella Muti, who is married to Victor's wayward son Walter, 
   who vanishes on the day when Giardino also takes a dive. Quite a lot 
   of people fall to their deaths in this film, for various different 
   reasons, as the complex mystery unfolds in a tale of cynical dwarves, 
   music that inspires suicide, three legged dogs, and that giallo 
   staple - an abandoned house holding many secrets.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As I said, the comedy isn't that great (although I did laugh out 
   loud in a scene involving the cop, and there's a scene where Marcello 
   is forced to take cocaine which is pretty funny), but the mystery is 
   good, supplying twists along the way and many giallo staples, from 
   disguised killers to rooftop chases to the old 
   'lets-see-what's-behind-the-wall' part we've seen in <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">PROFONDO

   ethereally beautiful. Riz Ortolani supplies a soundtrack full of 
   vocoder, lending the film a slightly funky feel.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    somewhere around the early to mid-Thirties I'd imagine. Fascism on 
   the rise, the Disco Scene so depressingly far in the future. Stefano 
   Patrizi (from <B><A HREF="action.htm#RomeArmedTeeth">THE TOUGH ONES</A></B>,
    who always reminds me of Andrew McCarthy for some reason), is a 
   young orphan who has a scholarship at a prominent Venetian school to 
   play piano or some shit. While there, he befriends Christian 
   Borromeo, a young seemingly rich kid with a superhot mother in the 
   form of Senta Berger (from <B><A HREF="#DiabolicalYours1967">DIABOLICALLY
    YOURS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="#BeautifulSummer1974">THE BEAUTIFUL SUMMER</A></B>).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At first, Stefano mistakes Senta for Christian's sister, but she 
   explains she had Christian when she was seventeen, but does not 
   regret doing so. It may be that the short gap in time means that the 
   friendship between Senta and her son is more informal, as he calls 
   her by her first name rather than mother, or it could be that 
   everyone in this film is filthy pervert. Which is probably true. One 
   thing is for sure - Stefano is definitely in there with Christian's 
   mother, as she (and Christian!) start grilling Stefano on how he'd 
   like to be with an older woman. Before you know it, Stefano and 
   Senter are bumping uglies. A review on the IMDb refers to nudity by 
   both Berger and Muti, but I didn't see any, so thanks for that, 
   YouTube's Film &amp; Clips channel!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things are all good with Stefano getting some from Senta, but all 
   this time Ornell Muti has been catching his eye in random encounters, 
   so he's delighted to find out that Senta is Muti's piano tutor. 
   Eventually the two meet, and Stefano finds that Muti is from a 
   genuinely rich and powerful family in Venice, rather than a 
   once-powerful family that Senta used to belong to. Now, if only he 
   can get rid of Muti's brother (who, and I might be reading too much 
   into things, may have had a thing for his own sister), and get on her 
   family's good side.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    All events in this film stem from Christian's insane love for his 
   own mother and his jealousy that Stefano is now the object of her 
   affection. If it weren't for that Stefano wouldn't have had to go 
   sniffing off elsewhere. It turns out that the apple doesn't fall far 
   from the tree as Senta isn't quite willing to let Stefano go without 
   a fight, which leads to treachery and a pretty brutal murder, and 
   also some social commentary about the rich are always fucking over 
   the poor.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The main focus here is Ornella Muti (from <B><A HREF="oasis_of_fear_1971.htm">OASIS
    OF FEAR</A></B> and my <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJvO67Mn2Sc">Wank

    OF EVIL</A></B> and the film where Claudio Cassinelli tries to bum 
   Giancarlo Prete (<B><A HREF="long_night_1975.htm">THE LONG NIGHT</A></B>),
    films Muti in every way possible, with her staring intently from 
   underneath her fringe to posing in dresses to putting on the 'I'm In 
   the Mood For Love' and giving Stefano serious 'do me' eyes. Totally 
   smouldering in every scene. Worked for me.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Not the most exciting film mind you, but Ornella Muti fans and Senta 
   Berger fans will get something out of it. Strangely, for a period 
   drama, the fascism thing wasn't really focussed on.</FONT></FONT></P>

    This one isn't as surreal but has the same languid pacing and lack

   films. Luckily I'm a big fan of lightbulb-headed Philippe Leroy, who 
   gives a sinister performance as an ex-Nazi trying in vain to prevent

   lead to his downfall.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's pity that Dirk is seemingly a slave to his testicles, and while

   camp survivor Charlotte Rampling, with whom he shared a nice cosy 
   master/slave relationship before those pesky allies came along and 
   ruined all the fun for the Third Reich, whose main pastime, according 
   to Italian films, is getting their rocks off in various depraved 
   ways. Luckily, this film doesn't go too far down that road, although 
   we do get a topless Charlotte Rampling singing some song, but all I 
   could think of at that bit was &quot;man, people were really thin in

   What's it about really? Selective memory maybe - Bogarde wants to

    Five people - psychic Bridgitte (Mara Maryl), her husband Luciano

   lover, hold a s&eacute;ance so that they might discover what happened 
   to Eilieen's brother Christian, who vanished nearly ten years to the 
   day. Brigitte can see what happened to Christian - it looks like some 
   supernatural force killed him (a knife basically floats of its own 
   accord, and even the telephone moves away from him as he tries to 
   call for help). That's all Brigitte can see, but the rest want to

   things get strange, as their car disappears (and reappears, then 
   vanishes), someone finds the knife used to kill Christian, and Paul 
   starts seeing Christian wandering about in the distance. It also 
   seems that every road they take to escape from the woods leads them

    This ultra-low budget film exists only in one form - a terrible 
   print on YouTube. It's okay for the first forty minutes or so, but 
   then for the next twenty another film keeps cutting in and the screen 
   freezes over and over again - It doesn't look like we miss too much 
   during this time, and luckily I got to see what happens to all the 
   characters and the end of the film. I nice cleaned up version would 
   be good, however. It's no classic but it would be good as a double 
   bill with the classic <B>LIBIDO</B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Maryl still plays the ditzy character of Brigitte from the first 
   film, and Pigozzi was no spring chicken to begin with but does well 
   here as the grumpy old man. There's almost literally one location for 
   the entire film and it looks cheap, but its interesting to see what 
   director Gastaldi can do with a low budget.</FONT></FONT></P>

   the form of The Ark, a mythical machine that most people believe will

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Life is pretty much hell for everyone down there, from functioning 
   people like Soft, to insane librarians who keep books only covering 
   the subject of the mysterious enemy who nuked the country, to a 
   friend of Soft who keeps dragging him away to see his 'Eden', which 
   turns out to be one of the grimmer parts of an already grim film, to 
   the strangest of all - a bunch of almost catatonic people who wander 
   around a huge hall being fed a strange type of bread from a tube that 
   hangs from the ceiling, the source of which is one of the few 
   satirical parts of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Visually it's a nightmare too. The vault (which reminded me very 
   much of the horror-filled vaults of the Fallout game series) are 
   badly lit with blue neon lights hanging from the ceilings and the 
   walls. Worms crawl along the floor and the walls crumble. Everything 
   is pretty monochromatic except for where Soft's potential love 
   interest lives, which is more warm and red. Not that she spends much 
   time in it, as instead she's doing a trapeze act over the hall of 
   catatonics. In fact, this is the second bluest film I've ever seen, 
   because no one's going to top Derek Jarman's film <B><A HREF="blue_1993.htm">BLUE</A></B>

   Marisa Mell finds not only the corpse of staff member Michele, of 
   whom she is told &quot;He was old&quot;, but she also finds that the 
   remaining staff member is Victor Israel in full 'socially-distancing' 
   eyeball mode. Avram claims Israel is harmless, but the guy seems to 
   be playing major mind games with Mell, while Avram seems to be deeply 
   shaken by the death of Michele and becomes withdrawn.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lacking attention, Marisa meets fellow American Peter Clarke (Lou 
   Castel, who seems drawn to this kind of film like a moth to a light 
   or a former glam rocker to a child). Peter claims to be an 
   anthropologist researching ancient curses in the area, and in 
   particular one that centres on Marisa's husband's family, It's around 
   this time that reality starts getting a bit pliable for Marisa, as it 
   turns out she's pregnant, and it's also around this time that we are 
   privy to a serial killer preying on hookers in the area, which 
   results in some splattery gore. Israel starts receiving phone calls 
   that reveal he's up to something, and then Marisa's dreams start 
   getting very weird as she sees a supernatural figure out in the 
   darkness and may even have been visited by an Incubus at some point.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm not talking anymore about the plot so you can spoil that for 
   yourself, but what we have here is a pretty well made horror film 
   that somehow hasn't been given the proper attention. There's not much 
   by way of gore with the exception of the hooker murders, but there's 
   tonnes of atmosphere and mystery with Marisa at the centre of some 
   sort of shenanigans that neither she or us are privy too, and that, 
   plus the moody cinematography, are what makes this film rather 
   enjoyable. There's loads of gothic stuff going on here, from the 
   sinister servants to the hidden rooms and the weird-ass shots of the 
   servants giving Marisa a birthday cake.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fans of either Marisa Mell's naked body or Chris Avram's arse will 
   be happy to know that both feature prominently here. One other 
   observation is that Lou Castel always looks like he's rolled out of 
   bed two minutes before shooting was supposed to start. He pretty much 
   looks like that in every film I've seen him in.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Obsession is one of those films that shows that sometimes desperate 
   people make bad decisions and perhaps shows us, the viewer, that we 
   too are only one step away from completely ruining our lives by doing 
   something dumb. A classic noir film full of moody cinematography, <B>OBSESSION</B> 
   is quite rightly seen as a great film, with it's depiction of people 
   trying to enjoy life while in the middle of a catastrophic war, the 
   Italian love of music and food rising above all, and how you've 
   always got to reap what you sow. Now that I'm done praising the film, 
   let's get down to what really matters - making sarcastic comments 
   about the actions of the characters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giovanna (Clara Calamai from <B><A HREF="deep_red_1976.htm">DEEP RED</A></B> 
   and a shitload of films from the thirties) is a young wife who 
   doesn't love her husband (Guiseppe) and only married him because she 
   had no money and hated having to drift around mooching food from men 
   (for sex, it's implied). Her husband is a big fat loudmouth who owns 
   a roadside bar/restaurant and thinks the man of the house is in 
   charge, doing such romantic things as having Giovanna dry all the 
   sweat off him after he's cycled home or generally moaning about her 
   homemaking skills. Luckily for her the hunkiest drifter in all of 
   Italy has just shown up at the bar, and the first thing he does is 
   give Giovanna a smouldering look and asks her if she'll cook him a 
   meal. Then he asks her again, because she doesn't answer the first time.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The drifter is Gino (Massimo Girotti from <B><A HREF="stateline_motel_1973.htm">MOTEL
    OF FEAR</A></B>) and he pretty much senses that Giovanna's got the 
   hots for him right away. It's a pity her husband is bouncing around 
   the place loudly shouting that she better guard the chickens because 
   there's a shifty-looking hobo lurking about the place, but Gino 
   manages to wangle his way in there, using his mechanical skills to 
   fix Guiseppe's truck and various other technical issues and it turns 
   out Guiseppe is a very trusting fellow, because about ten seconds 
   later he heads off fishing with a local vicar. Gino pretends to work 
   on a water pump for a second or two before Giovanna lures him into 
   the house with a song, siren like. Then they passionately make 
   love...probably. This is a film from nineteen forty-three so you 
   don't get to see anything.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Turns out when Guiseppe says he'll back soon that means he'll be 
   fannying about in the countryside most of the day while Giovanna and 
   Gino get it on. This gives Giovanna plenty of time to tell Gino her 
   life is shit and she hates Guiseppe's big fat arse and asks Gino to 
   stay with her forever, which comes across to me as kind of moving a 
   bit fast but then again there was a war on and such like. Gino agrees 
   to stay, but Guiseppe make things unbearable for both of them.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gino wants to hit the road with Giovanna but she can't face a life 
   of uncertainty again, so they sadly call it a day and Gino goes back 
   to drifting. It's here he meets The Spaniard (Elio Marcuzzo, who was 
   killed shorty after World War Two by partisans. Not shot as it says 
   on the IMDb, but hanged and buried alive when the hanging didn't 
   work, merely for translating some documents for an employee of a 
   fascist group, even though he was anti-fascist himself). The Spaniard 
   bales Gino out of a bad situation and takes him under his wing 
   (there's a lot of homosexual undertones here, mainly due to 
   Marcuzzo's gentle performance as The Spaniard). The most likeable 
   character in the film, The Spaniard gives Gino some sage advice after 
   finding out about the affair. &quot;Run as fast as you can from the 
   direction of Giovanna&quot;. Gino, however, thinks he knows better.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fate brings the love triangle together when Gino meets Giovanna and 
   Guiseppe as Guiseppe is entering a singing contest. The two lovers 
   find that they can't stay away from each other, but neither is 
   willing to budge on how their future could be. That's until Guiseppe 
   gets very drunk and insists on driving back home. The next day, 
   Giovanna and Gino are explaining how Guiseppe crashed the truck, but 
   the police are sceptical. Can their love prevail over all and their 
   dark secret stay hidden. Well...no.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now, if I killed someone I'd want no one to find out about it by not 
   ever mentioning it ever, but Giovanna and Gino simply don't know how 
   to do this. First Gino has a screaming argument with The Spaniard 
   which rouses the suspicions of a policeman hanging around, then an 
   open conversation about it in front of hired staff, then Giovanna and 
   Gino have a very vocal argument about it in a town square, then Gino 
   just outright confesses to some random girl he met. Oh, and Giovanna 
   writes a confession down, changes her mind, then scrumples up the 
   paper and tosses it to the side. At least they tried their hardest to 
   keep it a secret.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even though the film goes on forever, the run time doesn't become an 
   issue due to the acting and the whole look of the film. How they 
   managed to make this during a war is beyond me, but time wise it 
   looks like they managed to get it complete before the allied 
   invasion. Credit to both lead actors for both managing to look 
   smouldering, I was going to say that Clara Calamai is very easy on 
   the eye, but saying an Italian actress is attractive is like saying 
   that water is wet, so why bother?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    neither read the book by James Cain so the plot was all new to me, 
   but then again Luchino Visconti hasn't read the book either, so I 
   guess that's why James Cain gets no credit in the film. Probably just 
   a huge coincidence.</FONT></FONT></P>

   what might have been a heart attack. Sad days indeed, but even sadder 
   when I notice conspiracy theories about him dying because of some 
   sort of message he was trying to get across to 'warn the people' of 
   how the government was going to invent a cataclysm in order to 
   control people and reduce the population. Either that or how he's 
   explaining 9/11 was a set up. Now, whether or not you believe that 
   was a set-up or coronavirus is fake (I have no opinion on either), 
   I'm pretty sure you don't cover up a guy trying to wake up the people 
   to a conspiracy by killing him and drawing attention to a low-budget, 
   so-so film that no one was ever going to watch in the first place. 
   I've watched it to see what all the fuss was about so theoretically 
   assassinating Rik Mayall kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?

    Anyway, the plot itself concerns one Dione, a wannabe children's 
   writer working in a cafe in an English coastal town. She's happy 
   because her best mate is the cafe owner's daughter, but her policeman 
   boyfriend Jeff isn't happy because he's one of these dicks in life 
   who keep nagging their other half about getting better jobs and shit 
   like that. Dione would rather hang about with her pal Lily and much 
   sexier, less uptight John, which makes Jeff jealous to the point 
   where they split up. Dione goes to live with Lily, who seems to be 
   part of a conspiracy group consisting of herself, her dad, this John 
   guy, and Rik Mayall. They all believe that there is an upcoming 
   conspiracy to reduce world population, but are not sure in what form 
   that'll take, be it the military, or some sort of biowarfare lab 
   developed virus. They are also types who seem to think that its a big 
   revelation that religion, sport, race, gender are such like are used 
   to control the population, and that people need to wake up. Not that 
   they attempt to wake many people up because they all sit around 
   jawing for almost the entire duration of the film. It's like <B><A HREF="matrix_trilogy_1999-2003.htm">THE

   Fishburne, if Laurence sat around raising an eyebrow now and again, 
   playing Jenga, and eating pasta bake.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I wouldn't say the film is a complete failure, but it's not exactly 
   a roller-coaster ride either. Sure, there are slight (and I mean 
   slight) comparisons with the shit storm we're all living through now, 
   and those who love a 9/11 conspiracy will cream themselves when they 
   see <B><A HREF="drop_dead_fred_1991.htm">DROP DEAD FRED</A></B> 
   talking about the way the two towers fell, but I got the feeling that 
   Rik Mayall was half-arsing this one and just trying to perhaps add a 
   known name to cast list in order to help a low budget film? I mean, 
   compare him here to what he was doing in the TV series <B><A HREF="rik_mayall_tribute_page_1958-2014.htm">MAN
    DOWN</A></B> around the same time, where he was outstanding. Either 
   way, no one is going to listen to me because be it 9/11, Brexit, 
   Scottish Independence, Black Lives Matter, the US Election, or 
   whatever's happening in Belarus that I'm not paying attention to, 
   everyone has already formed their own firm opinions on the matter and 
   has limitless internet resources/allies to back up that opinion, and 
   a lot of those people are online just now, arguing with people who 
   hold opposing views to theirs. Maybe that's the true conspiracy - 
   those in power want to keep everyone arguing online so they can get 
   up to the shady stuff in the background.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   the answer to the second one (which begs the question why I asked

   Duccio Tessari films in the hope that there's something out there 
   he's made that's the equal to <B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">TONY ARZENTA</A></B>.
    So far, no luck, although there are some other good Tessari films. 
   This film isn't one of them. Plus, I'm babbling so I don't have to 
   try and recall the plot, which I'm sure even the screenwriter had 
   trouble recalling.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Five hot shot skiers are really just four cold shit skiers and one 
   good one called Gustav. Gustav is quitting the sport (Speed skiing? I 
   dunno) and the rest of the team need him because they don't do so 
   good without him. And their coach is threatening to get rid of all of 
   them if they don't have Gustav. They talk Gustav back into the sport, 
   but then one of the cockier skiers takes a tumble and breaks his 
   back, destroying his career and making him one whiney, petulant bitch.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The guy ends up in a wheelchair and at one point proposes to do the 
   ski run (time trials?) in his wheelchair, which would have made a 
   much funnier film. Instead, Gustav and the team man up to get the 
   bestest ski speed time and it takes ONE HOUR AND FORTY-SIX MINUTES to

   was wearing were cool. But come on! Skiing? Why?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I went skiing once to Aviemore and hated it. Maybe that hate 
   manifested itself subliminally throughout the running time of the 
   film and that's why I didn't like the film, or maybe it's because 
   Duccio Tessari totally fluked it with <B>TONY ARZENTA</B> and is

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">From
    the outer reaches of the Euro-trash comes this daft mash-up of heist 
   movie and giallo, all delivered in a strange way by director/actor 
   Gianni Marena, who seemingly had the idea to cram as much as possible 
   into this near two-hour film. Stick with it though &#150; it gets 
   funnier as it goes on.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gianni plays Luca, a hard case drafted in from America to pull a 
   heist. For some reason he goes to Paris first for a meeting before 
   heading to Italy to pull the heist, which means that almost half an 
   hour passes before we get to the heist. Long story short, the gang 
   steal 800 million lire, inadvertently shoot an employee, then head 
   for the hills to hide out, awaiting instructions from Sicily.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now forgive me for being a bit vague about the next bit, but the 
   print I watched of the film was a bit dark so it was hard to make 
   out. We&nbsp; have three guys and three (or four) women staying in 
   this villa, all wanting their cut for the heist, but what we also 
   have now is a black gloved killer stalking around the house, and 
   his/her first victim is (I think) one of the women involved in a 
   lesbian sex scene that has nothing to do with anything. Dafter still, 
   the killer likes to paint the top of the victim&#146;s head white! 
   Why? No idea.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Somehow Luca thinks that the best way to avoid the killer would be 
   to move to another house, and I&#146;ve got to admit with the mute, 
   crazy housekeeper and the gruff caretaker things are a bit more 
   &#145;giallo&#146;. Here, they receive news from Sicily to stay put 
   with the money, so obviously they all start bickering, including one 
   fellow who has a hissy fit because the rest of the gang think his 
   movie making plans are stupid. I&#146;ve got to point out here that 
   while he&#146;s describing this reddened images of what looked like 
   New York are superimposed on the screen. Once again: no idea.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things pick up when the killer starts offing people again, including 
   someone in the garden who didn&#146;t seem related to the film at 
   all. Also, one of their victims isn&#146;t quite dead and starts 
   chasing the mute housekeeper around the house with their head painted 
   white and a knife sticking out their back! My second favourite bit of 
   the film was when one character is driving through open countryside 
   before realising the brake lines have been cut in the car, before 
   suddenly driving off a huge cliff that appears from nowhere.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    My favourite bit is when Luca starts losing his mind and has this 
   weird dream where the gang are all happy and hanging around a ski 
   slope before being interrupted by policemen on skis, before the dream 
   switches to the gang dressed in black and carrying a coffin, droning 
   on about &#147;A litre of bile for the sheep&#148;. It&#146;s as if 
   Marena thought &#147;Hey! Devil worship plots are popular &#150; 
   better throw that in too&#148;. His scream as he wakes up is the 
   icing on the cake.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I&#146;m still leaving plenty to discover here. Everything about the 
   film: the acting, the editing, the cinematography, is strangely &#145;off&#146;.</FONT></FONT></P>

    When things are really freaky there's some kind of cathartic 
   pleasure derived from the assault in the senses, but the avant-garde 
   director bit dragged on. I'm sure it means something to somebody, but 
   I'm not sure Terence Hill has it on his Linkedn profile, that's for sure!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    You won't believe what happened to me the other day! I joined the 
   Mile High Club! Is it right that you just do it in your seat, egged 
   on by passengers? That's what me and Luca did, anyway. The air 
   hostesses seemed mildly put out about, but all they did was put a 
   blanket on us which just kind of fell off again. There was a guy 
   playing a guitar and then I played a flute badly and then you won't 
   believe what happened - the airplane started to plunge to the ground! 
   The pilot was all like 'put your seatbelts on' which nobody did, then 
   everyone was screaming and flying about the place and when I looked 
   out the window it seemed like the plane was some really bad kid's toy 
   being shaken about, but that might just have been panic setting in. I 
   said there and then that if God save me I would devote my life to him 
   - which he did!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Long story short - the plane became stable again and we all laughed 
   and celebrated and Luca looked all sad when I told him I was giving 
   up the crazy hippy life to become a nun. Mum reacted even worse, but 
   she's nothing but a wrinkly old whore anyway, ranting on about the 
   gift that God gave me (she means my fanny) and this and that while 
   wearing enough golden necklaces around her neck it looks like she's 
   joined the Ndebele tribe over in Africa. She's a total pain the arse.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anyway, I'll write again from the convent. It's called The Church of 
   Saint Rosalba Neri of the Engorged Erogenous Zones. I hope they have 
   individual toilets because have you ever used the bog after an old

    I'm all holy and shit now, but celibacy sucks! I've only made love 
   to Sister Eleonora three times today, and once with that hot painter 
   guy who looks a lot like actor Vassili Karis (you know, the guy from <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#Scalps1987">SCALPS</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#GialloInVenice1979">GIALLO IN VENEZIA</A></B>).
    He started giving me the eye the moment I started at the convent, 
   but Sister Eleonora got in there first, using the old 'cycling-along-with-a-basket-of-apples-before-plunging-into-a-huge-puddle-and-saying-'Oh,
    your clothes are all wet, better take them off'-move. So one thing 
   led to another and we've got it on a few times, and then me and the 
   painter got it on while I was pulling the ropes in the bell tower 
   when he showed up with a kind of 'I've got something better for you 
   to pull' look in his eyes. Luckily, he was smart enough to tie the 
   bell ropes around his ankles so he could ring the bells while ringing 
   my bell.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'd didn't think that anyone noticed, but when I looked out the bell 
   tower all the nuns were looking in my direction, but I guess there 
   might have been a rare bird flying by.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    You know who showed up the other day? Luca! He's on the run now due 
   to some botched jewellery robbery where a policeman was wounded or 
   killed or something, so I've hidden him up in the bell tower. I was a 
   bit preoccupied with toilet duties however, and I was wondering where 
   he was going to poop, and he's all like 'don't sweat it' and I'm like 
   'what, are you going to go in the corner?' and he's like 'look- it's 
   not a big deal' and I said 'because you can't just hang your arse out 
   the side of the bell tower and let loose, because some nun is going 
   to notice' and he's like 'just leave it' and I said 'because your not 
   doing it in a box or something and leaving it for me to carry down to 
   a toilet' and then he went in a huff. Men. Also when he called me at 
   the convent I was like &quot;AH LUCAAAAA!&quot; at the top of my 
   voice, then pretended that my mother was sick.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Worst still, and you won't believe this, us novice nuns were 
   marrying Jesus in a ceremony and it turns out that Sister Eleonora 
   sneaked up into the tower to give Luca one. Despite me getting my 
   rocks off with Eleonora, artist guy, and dream Jesus, I had a hissy 
   fit and have now left the church. All men are bastards. Nuns too, all 
   nuns are bastards. Jesuses too - all Jesuses are bastards. Is there 
   more than one Jesus? I wasn't really listening during Jesus class.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I think Luca got arrested, so he's probably having his shit pushed 
   in right now, so he won't have to worry about where he poops for a while.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>

    I've gone back to mum's house. You know how sometimes you kind of 
   have the soundtrack to your life going on in your own head? For some 
   reason I imagined, when approaching my mum's house, that a guy with 
   brain damage should be screeching about how the devil has his claws 
   in me while loads of geese scream in the background. Not sure why, 
   but then again it was a crazy night - I ended up auctioning my fanny 
   off to everyone attending the party, including the painter guy and a 
   guy who looked a lot like actor Marco Guglielmi -you might know him 
   from such films as <B><A HREF="bandidos_1967.htm">BANDIDOS</A></B>, <B><A HREF="how_to_kill_a_judge_1974.htm">HOW

    Then we all had an orgy so we had to air the place out a bit the

    a nice twist on the old 'guess the killer' stick that we get with 
   the gialli, in this film we get a bit of 'guess the witness' instead, 
   but first we get to see a man in a neck brace who kind of looks like 
   Sean Connery get off a flight at the airport, get into a car, and 
   drive to somewhere nearby the airport, where he removes his neck 
   brace, wig, moustache, eyebrows and contact lenses before the plane 
   he was on explodes. Looking kind of smug, he heads to the boarding 
   school where Ray Milland works and lives.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ray seems to have been the instigator of such actions, as he pays 
   the fellow a rather large amount of money for killing someone called 
   Andolini, but when the hitman reveals that an entire plane full of 
   people have also died in the process, Ray goes nuts. The hitman tries 
   to explain that the murder will be almost undetectable and the 
   explosion blamed on terrorists (which has happened in real life a few 
   times), but Ray's response is to bash the brains out of the guy using 
   the most cumbersome ashtray in film history.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Worse still for Ray, the audience has been made aware that some kid 
   is wandering about in the dark, sneaking into the kitchen to get at a 
   jar of pickles (and spattering his shoes in the process). The kid 
   seemingly spots the murder through a very unwisely placed window 
   above Ray's room which is on the kid's route between kitchen and 
   dorm, and although Ray catches a glimpse of the kid, he has no idea 
   who it is, and neither do we. All Ray knows is that the kid lost his 
   shoes on the way back to the dorm, and the kid is a size thirty-two, 
   and the shoes smell of pickle.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then get to find out why Ray wanted someone dead - it was so he 
   could get into Silvia Koscina's grundies. She was the one who ordered 
   Ray to arrange the hit, and it turns out her husband was the intended 
   victim. Kind of awkward that Silvia has a kid at Ray's boarding 
   school, but it gets funny for us as Ray seems to build his entire 
   teaching curriculum around the possible witness to his murder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At first Ray checks to see if any kids are missing shoes, but the 
   only one that is missing shoes is the kid in the infirmary with the 
   broken leg, so the witness has stolen his. Ray then starts testing 
   the kids. He makes every kid sit in a chair having their pulse 
   monitored while Ray stares intently at them while crushing cigarette 
   butts into the murder weapon/giant ashtray. He does word association 
   with them in class about the words 'window' and 'ashtray', and then 
   tests their memory by showing them a picture of the hitman (whom the 
   police have identified by now) and asks them to recall details of his features.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Funnier still, when Ray fixes on a kid, the film goes into giallo 
   mode while he murders them - his first kill is a straightforward 
   poisoning, but his second involves stalking a kid at a swimming pool, 
   complete with black gloves. And the look on his face when he realises 
   that the kid he's just killed is not the witness is pretty funny...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Absurd premise aside, this is a pretty fun, if bloodless film. It's 
   like an episode of <B><A HREF="columbo_tv_series.htm">COLUMBO</A></B> 
   where Columbo has forgotten to turn up. There are some nice 
   giallo-style shots scattered about the film too, from Ray's shadow on 
   the wall above the empty bed of a victim, to him walking backlit 
   towards a kid. Some <A HREF="student_connection_1973.htm#OST">good music</A> 
   too, especially the funky music used during the overlong chase scene 
   near the end.</FONT></FONT></P>

    I exclaimed, while watching some pretentious Japanese animated film (<B><A HREF="wolf_children_2012.htm">WOLF
    CHILDREN</A></B>, it turns out). &quot;What was that?&quot; my wife 
   asked, languishing nearby on a futon, dressed in only a coat made 
   from Madagascan Tenrecs. &quot;That,&quot; I said, waving my glass of 
   brandy in the air, &quot;was the sound of my brain trying to vomit 
   out of my ear because of this film.&quot; I'll never forget her 
   reply. &quot;That,&quot; She imitated, around a mouthful of roasted 
   dolphin, &quot;is how I feel when you are watching one your crappy 
   old European films.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    My blood froze. Cold sweat broke out on my forehead. My fingers 
   clenched into my palms, forming bloody crescents. I unsteadily rose 
   to my feet, staggering to the front door, only pausing once to vomit 
   into one of my children's wellington boots. I somehow made it to my 
   car, got in, and blindly drove through the tears until my heart 
   stopped racing. I parked the car in a disabled space and, hunched and 
   tortured, called my wife from a phone box somewhere outside the town 
   of Penrith. I couldn't believe how much they charge for a simple 
   phone call these days.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;Wh-what did you say?&quot; I muttered into the phone. &quot;How
    can you compare an arty Japanese film with Italian (and/or Spanish) 
   films? How can you, for example, compare that to the Italian 
   Rambo-rip off <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#BrothersInWar">BROTHERS 
   IN WAR</A></B>, where the two protagonists sing &quot;Jingle 
   Bells&quot; to cheer each other up while captured by the Vietcong?&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Noting that I had several minutes left and wanting to get my money's 
   worth, I continued. &quot;<B>PANCHO VILLA</B> is another example. 
   It's a seventies Spanish film with Telly Savalas playing the titular 
   General, and yes, since you ask, people do say 'titular' to each 
   other in conversation. This film spends about five minutes discussing 
   why Pancho Villa has no hair just so it can have an excuse to have 
   Telly Savalas in the lead role. It's not striving for any artistic merit!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I angrily pounded my slave-shop produced meerkat skin gloves on the 
   telephone box walls, stomping my crocodile skin boots. &quot;And what 
   about the bit where Chuck Connors has an entire room of US army 
   officers trying to catch a fly? That was terrible no matter what way 
   you looked at it. Just thought I'd mention that bit. What I'm trying 
   to say is these films aren't meant to be taken seriously. This is 
   supposedly a historic film about a guy who invaded America, and 
   instead we get Telly Savalas pretending to be in a coma, trying to 
   sort out his sidekick's marital problems, and some other third 
   example, too!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I was in tears now, and would have been lying on the floor of the 
   phone box had it not been for my ivory walking stick. &quot;I mean, 
   Telly Savalas sings the jazzy theme tune at the end! How can you 
   deride these spectacles of wonder I hold dear to my heart? How? For 
   is it not enough that I deemed you suitable to bear my children? Must 
   you destroy my true love in life &#150; the crappy Euro film?&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    &quot;Why are you using a phone box instead of your mobile 
   phone?&quot; She asked, deaf to my entreaties. My vision greyed as I 
   stumbled out into the night, a broken man. Nearby a red squirrel 
   paused in its search for food to regard my twitching form. I felt a 
   little bit better as I opened the back door of the car and set my two 
   attack dogs on it.</FONT></FONT></P>

   (from what I know about it), this is a film set on a cotton 
   plantation that tries to mix exploitation elements with a serious 
   message about racism. Plus, now that the world's gone mad, I'd 
   imagine some folks out there who would be more uncomfortable with 
   regards to the message about how we are all the same and should be 
   equal and more comfortable with black folk being subjugated. It's not 
   like me to get political - better get back to jokes about arses and 
   balls and stuff. After all, the message of this film is that 
   everyone's spunk is the same colour.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Malisa Longo is a southern Belle with fur on her words and eyes for 
   the slaves, but she's also insane, so every time she gets some off of 
   one of her slaves, she goes nuts and calls for the help to break out 
   the chains and whip those black guys good. She also doesn't think 
   that her father is harsh enough on the slaves. After all, he only 
   makes them work ten hours a day. Nevertheless, she has plans, and 
   that is to get her lover Lawrence married into the family so she can 
   take over. Or something.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lawrence at first is nearly as bad as Malisa, eyeing up the young 
   lady slaves, acting like a dick, and boffing Malisa every chance he 
   can get. His father is also a plantation owner and the marriage is 
   approved, only something happens to Lawrence that changes everything. 
   He gets bitten by a snake. Not on the balls like I hoped, but on the 
   leg. When a pretty slave lady saves his from death by using a herbal 
   remedy, Lawrence is transformed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lawrence now believes that slavery should be abolished and falls in 
   love with the girl that saved him. Trouble is that she belongs to 
   Malisa and Malisa is as crazy as hell. In a case of 'well, that 
   escalated quickly', Lawrence and Malisa have a lovers tiff over the 
   slave, only for Malisa's henchmen beating the crap out of Lawrence 
   and Lawrence shooting some of the help when they try and rape the 
   slave girl. Was there even an audience for this kind of crap back 
   then? There's also a sub-plot about two of Lawrence's henchmen 
   forcing slaves on each other then having jealous slave lover types 
   fight it out. Then Lawrence shoots them as well.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Full of very crap simulated sex but not much nudity and sleaze, this 
   film cannot even achieve the terrible goals it set for itself in the 
   first place. Malisa Longo has never been much of an actress either, 
   but you get to see her naked a lot if you are a fan. Lots of naked 
   slave arses too for those who get off on that stuff, and judging by 
   the 1.5 million views the film has on YouTube, someone out there 
   likes gyrating slave butts. Haven't they heard of XHamster? That's 
   where Fulci's <B><A HREF="devils_honey_1986.htm">THE DEVIL'S HONEY</A></B>

    DELIRIUM</A></B> will know that Bergonzelli is an off-kilter 
   director who likes to pack his film full of plot twists, and this one 
   is no exception. It starts off in a fairly Eurocrime style, with 
   three junkies driving a car straight into a shop and robbing the 
   place before heading back to their pad to shoot up some skag. These 
   three, who include Manuela (Karin Well - the blonde from <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BurialGround1980">BURIAL

   'aint a natural blonde!) and two smug, gum chewing hippy types, one 
   ginger, the other seemingly channelling David Hess, decide that petty 
   robbing isn't for them any more and head for the big guns.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The big gun in their sights is none other than William Berger, here 
   playing a senator who claims he is out to rid the political system of 
   corruption, something that doesn't please fellow politician Arthur 
   Kennedy for reasons that become clear later. In public Berger may be 
   the clean living fellow, but once he's done with work he picks up 
   Manuela, who has complicated ties with Berger's family, and the two 
   junkies to go back to Berger's house for drink, disco, and naked 
   speeches from Shakespeare's The Tempest. Berger might be having a 
   good time, but when he tries to give the ginger junky a chewie, he's 
   photographed in the act by the other guy. That blackmail plan would 
   have worked out if they didn't accidentally kill him straight after.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Berger's son is Carlo De Mejo and it appears that the apple didn't 
   fall far from the tree, as he returns home to find his dad dead and 
   some people escaping. Firing wildly into the dark, he shoots Manuela 
   in the shoulder while the others escape. It's here we find out that 
   Manuela used to not only be Carlo's lover, but also his sister's 
   lover, and Berger may have been murdered, but there's a huge life 
   insurance policy with a natural cause clause attached to it, so it's 
   handy that Carlo's sister Nadia is a doctor, eh? Can you believe all 
   this happens in the first twenty minutes or so of this film?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What follows is a full throttle dive into cover-ups, blackmail (from 
   all angles), political back-stabbings, sneaky journalism, mind games, 
   back room bargaining, murder, and even a little bit of Gothic thrown 
   in for good measure as Carlo, Nadia, and the ever-changing allegiance 
   of Manuela also have to put up with Berger's shady housekeeper Alida 
   Valli (who does a good turn here). There's also Kennedy's role in all 
   this and his hired goons who do his dirty work. It seems that in this 
   world no one has a clear conscience and it's a case of the most 
   ruthless being the survivor.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As well as cramming as much plot into the film as possible, 
   Bergonzelli also throws in almost subliminal split-second editing, 
   trippy visuals, and even a self-referential film about the events of 
   the film where he reveals how he gets that prism-like LSD shot. Now 
   that's attention to detail. This is one film that could really do 
   with being cleaned up, subtitled, and sold to the public.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There seems to be some sort of message in this one about how people 
   turn their eyes away from the bad things that happen in the world, 
   but I was too taken aback by William Berger doing a full frontal. 
   Better tick that one off my bucket list now.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">It's
    best to point out straight away that folks who like anything 
   happening in their films should probably walk away from this one 
   right now, because this is a film that can indulge itself so much 
   there's a scene literally made up of still photographs from the river 
   Ganges, and the film itself ends with a minute long shot of a wall. 
   Still, I was strangely sucked in by this one, due to the fluid camera 
   work, the gorgeous music, and Giancarlo Giannini's big sad eyes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's not much to say about it mind you. Ambient, laidback music 
   and shots of clouds start off the film and pretty much give an 
   indication of what were about to experience. This is a film that is 
   quiet and subdued, where people have civil conversations and barely 
   raise their voices.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giannini's just returned to Rome after spending some time in India 
   documenting life and death on the River Ganges, and he's having a 
   hard time adjusting to life back in the eternal city. First he visits 
   his girlfriend (Delia Boccardo), and although they enjoy a healthy 
   bout of welcome back sex in a pink velvet room, reality soon creeps 
   in as Giancarlo is driven nuts the next day by the incessant beeping 
   of car horns on a busy Roman street (In Rome, beeping your horn means 
   &quot;Get out of my way&quot;, &quot;I need right of way&quot;, 
   &quot;I'm driving down the street&quot;, &quot;I'm beeping my horning 
   because I'm a complete asshole&quot; and &quot;I'm beeping my horn 
   because that's what Rome needs right now, another fucking car horn at 
   full volume&quot;). Giancarlo can't believe he's returned to what he 
   calls 'the trap', and finds out that the people he left behind aren't 
   so happy either.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Case in point is sister Valeria (Valeria Moriconi, from <B><A HREF="camp_followers_1965.htm">THE
    CAMP FOLLOWERS</A></B>). Valeria comes across as a free-living party 
   girl, but Giancarlo finally gets it out of her that she's completely 
   miserable and lost in life. He later also finds out that she doesn't 
   visit her father anymore either. Everyone seems to be in a pretty 
   melancholy moon, except I guess the actress Nadia (Orchidea De 
   Santis, from the giallo <B><A HREF="your_sweet_body_to_kill_1970.htm">YOUR
    SWEET BODY TO KILL</A></B>). She features in what is the only part 
   of the film with humour, as she's taking part in a film being made 
   which seems to involve her taunting and eating ice cream in from of 
   Leopoldo Trieste while he's handcuffed to a radiator.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Basically, the film is just a series of scenes where Giancarlo goes 
   to meet someone and they discuss life and death, before Giancarlo 
   moves on to someone else. It's a very solemn film, and is rather sad 
   in the end, but as I said, nothing really happens. On the other hand 
   I've never quite experienced a film with an atmosphere quite like it. 
   The music and rather unique cinematography (I can't quite put my 
   finger on it, but it's both fluid and kind of cold at the same time), 
   combined with Giancarlo's subdued reactions to a world he doesn't 
   want to be in make for something I was fascinated by.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The very small amount of information and reviews about this film 
   aren't favourable so take that as a warning.</FONT></FONT></P>

    In a strange version of Italy that is both modern, with cars and 
   shit, and medieval, with the old clothes and that, poor Giorgio is at 
   a crossroads in life. He doesn't want to work alongside his father 
   any longer, but wants to be a detective instead. His mother, nun Ida 
   Galli, disapproves, but never the less he sets off to start his 
   detective agency, moving into an arcane chamber behind a golden door.

    On his way he gathers a crew he calls Brothers of the Night, one of 
   whom is pyromaniac, and sets out going around all levels of society 
   trying to find proof of Jesus being a real dude. Walking the streets 
   he finds his childhood sweetheart is now a prostitute (she was 
   reluctant to tell him during a last-supper sequence earlier in the 
   film where Giorgio manages to find more wine for wedding guests), and 
   she joins the group. He also encounters Edmund Purdom as the devil, 
   who offers him anything he wants not to find out the truth, and 
   Franco Ressel as a criminal who mocks him for his mission. There's 
   also a Pontius Pilate policeman who has it in for Giorgio, and a more 
   sympathetic cop in the form of Adolfo Lastretti (from unusual crime 
   film <B><A HREF="one_way_1973.htm">ONE WAY</A></B> and Damiano

    However, all that cast cannot cover up the fact that this film is 
   all talk and although some of the sets are impressive, some give off 
   the impression that you are watching a theatre show rather than a 
   film. The surprise twist at the end is about as surprising as taking 
   your socks off and finding feet attached to the bottom of your legs.

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Terrible jokes aside, it's weird that he'd tried to revive the 
   swashbuckler genre because let's face it, no one liked it the first 
   time around. I know late in the Italian film industry there were 
   attempts to revive interest in certain genres, like the Spaghetti 
   Western (<B><A HREF="jonathan_of_the_bears_1994.htm">JONATHAN OF THE BEARS</A></B> 
   - great film), and Eurocrime (<B><A HREF="#FirstActionHero1994">FIRST

   crappy pirate film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Thankfully, the English dub is hilarious! It seems they blew the 
   budget on set, authentic ships and costumes, and locations, and then 
   realised they didn't have enough money to get in a proper dubbing 
   team, electing instead to hire a local amateur dramatics troupe. This 
   gives us side-splitting accents for most of the the characters, 
   including one that sounds like Mick Jagger, terrible imitations of 
   Chinese people, and foley effects that seem to have been thrown 
   together in someone's kitchen. You don't get to hear swords clashing

    The plot at first resembles a very famous film indeed. On his way to 
   Jamaica to forge an alliance with the French against the Spanish, 
   Lord Hamilton's ship is boarded by sneaky pirates (who all shout 
   &quot;Aaarrr&quot; and &quot;Pieces of Eight!&quot; while they 
   fight!), killing the crew and taking Lord Hamilton prisoner. Back 
   home, Lady Hamilton can't get any help from the King, so she goes to 
   a bar full of freaks to pick up a cocky pirate by the name of Hans 
   Solo I mean Thomas Butler, the 'gentleman pirate' who, when he 
   remembers, has a Scottish accent. The film then turns into <B><A HREF="dirty_dozen_1967.htm">THE

   Hamilton (Anita Rinaldi, of porn films such as <B>SEYMORE BUTTS: MY 
   TRAVELS WITH THE TRAMP</B>) head off to Jamaica to rescue her 
   husband. There's a few fights in there, a bit of double-crossing, 
   flirting with cast members, that kind of shit. It's not the greatest 
   to be honest. Don't watch it. Why don't we see if Joe D'Amato has any 
   funny film titles in his porn filmography instead? That'll pass the time.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Let's see. Not much that's funny, but it looks like old Joe tried to 
   revive many a defunct genre, in porn form! There's the Western/Porno 
   films <B>CALAMITY JANE 2</B> and <B>JOE D'AMATO'S OUTLAWS</B>, the 
   Peplum/Porn films <B>SAMSON IN AMAZON LAND</B> and <B>HERCULES: A SEX ADVENTURE</B>,

    very nifty, Dali-esque credit sequence ushers us in to a film full 
   of atmosphere and dread, but just slightly falls short of the mark of 
   being a great film. Still, I'm glad I stumbled upon it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In a Croatian town young writer Ivan is struggling to make ends 
   meet, and no one cares, because everyone else is struggling to make 
   ends meet too. The country is going through a very bad economical 
   downturn and Ivan has been forced to try and sell his books on the 
   streets, and it is in this flea market that he meets mysterious girl 
   Sonja. Sonja shows him kindness by giving him her scarf, but during a 
   protest on the street the two become separated and Ivan goes to the 
   park to sleep on a bench, having been evicted earlier that day...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ivan must have one of those faces, because even though the patrolman 
   in the park tells him he can't sleep on a bench, he does show him a 
   huge empty bank that he can use for a few nights, as long as he keeps 
   his mouth shut about it. Ivan agrees, and accessing the bank via a 
   sewer grate, he finds an empty office to bed down in. He's too hungry 
   to wonder why someone has stashed a huge amount of food in one of the 
   cupboards, and is also delighted to find that the phone still works, 
   which means he can try and track down Sonja.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's about this point I started wondering if anything was going to 
   happen and it was about this point that the director flew from 
   Croatia to my house, kicked down my front door, rushed into the 
   living room and hoofed me in the nuts, shouting &quot;YES, something 
   is going to happen.&quot; And he was right! Hearing music, Ivan 
   creeps through the bank to find what looks like a huge dinner 
   party/orgy going on in the main entrance, only some of these people 
   look a bit...odd. About two minutes later, everyone is called to 
   stand before a shadowy figure who we soon find out intends to take 
   over the world...someone who thrives in poverty and disease. Der Rattengott!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's a kind of <B><A HREF="they_live_1988.htm">THEY LIVE</A></B> 
   situation involving rats, with Ivan finding himself joining up with a 
   very small group of people going up against an increasingly large 
   amount of rat humans who love getting jobs within the civil service. 
   Paranoia also sets in as it turns out they can imitate people Ivan 
   knows. Can he find a way out or is he rat nuggets? My kids have two 
   rats, I wonder what they would have made of this one if they weren't 
   more intent in climbing up my trousers and punching me in the scrotum 
   for a laugh.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It looks like there wasn't much of budget for this one but it's good 
   to watch the increasingly paranoid Ivan trying to get around town 
   without losing his marbles. The rat/human effects are not that great 
   though, but the film's atmosphere is dark and broody. The only 
   problem is that there's maybe too much brooding and not enough 
   munching, as following the initial discovery of the rat people, 
   things don't get manic enough. Still, it's short and well worth 
   sitting down for.</FONT></FONT></P>

   even better.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Based loosely upon Homer's The Odyssey, <A HREF="giuliano_gemma_amazon_films.htm">Giuliano
    Gemma</A> plays Montgomery Brown, a Union Officer returning home 
   after the Civil War. Stopping off at a local tavern for a drink, he 
   notices that the barman, a good friend of his, is pretending not to 
   know him, probably due to the mean-looking Mexican duo sitting in the 
   corner of the bar. A gunfight ensues (not much of one, as Gemma drops 
   the two bad guys really quickly), and then he finds out what's really 
   going on in town: gold was discovered, two Mexican brothers have 
   ridden over the border to claim it, declaring the land and the town 
   as Mexican land, and his wife is now engaged to one of the brothers.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gemma doesn't take this news too well and turns to booze instead, 
   something he is prone to doing throughout the film. With his whole 
   life stolen from him and an army of murderous Mexican practically 
   surrounding his wife, he decides to go undercover and try and figure 
   out how to get his wife back, so he dyes his skin (!) and hair and 
   goes into town as a drifter, which is quite handy as the brothers 
   have just bribed a Union soldier into declaring that Montgomery Brown 
   has died so one of them can marry his wife!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Never mind the plot though, it's how this film is put together is 
   what makes it magical. <B>THE RETURN OF RINGO</B> is gorgeous to look 
   at. When you think of Spaghetti Westerns you think of sand, barren 
   landscapes, sweaty men in torn clothing. Here it's a wonderful world 
   of pastel colours and bright clothing, the former of which is brought 
   to screen by the use of flowers, which are every in town thanks to 
   Gemma's sidekick Morning Glory, who lies in a house full of weird 
   gadgets and plants. Nieves Navarro is drop dead gorgeous in this film 
   and struts about in loads of loud, garish costumes. Even Fernando 
   Sancho, usually chewing on a chicken's leg, lives in a house where 
   even the crockery is multi-coloured. Add to that the method of 
   filming people with colourful objects in front of them and primary 
   colours behind them, and you've got a Spaghetti Western that's 
   punching well above its weight.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then there's all the little tricks and techniques Tessari throws in 
   there, like filming people through objects (just like Enzo 
   Castellari), or throwing in an unbroken long take at the bad guy's 
   villa, panning around a dining table as Nievess Navarro sings a 
   Mariachi song in the background, starting with her and featuring most 
   of the cast. You get the feeling that Tessari was really into pushing 
   himself with this one, as the film is full of tiny details that give 
   the film a sense that its deeper than it might actually be, with 
   Gemma's facial twitch and Antonio Casas' bizarre method of overcoming 
   his shakes while drinking whiskey.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The cast do well, too - Nievess Navarro as the fortune reading whore 
   and part-time lover of Fernando Sancho, Mexican tyrant and brother to 
   the more serious, knife-throwing George Martin, who is determined to 
   marry Gemma's wife Lorella De Luca, backed up by sad-eyed, redundant 
   sheriff Antonio Casas (from the <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Sound Of Horror">SOUND
    OF HORROR</A></B>). Manuel Muniz (from the <B><A HREF="killing_of_the_dolls_1975.htm">KILLER
    OF DOLLS</A></B>), and even Duccio Tessari and screenwriter Fernando 
   De Leo as hired goons!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Like someone shaving a truffle over what would have been an already 
   tasty meal, <A HREF="return_of_ringo_1965.htm#OST">Ennio Morricone's soundtrack</A> 
   just seals the deal on <B>THE RETURN OF RINGO</B> being one of the 
   true classic Spaghetti Westerns. Bombastic and emotional, it does 
   what a Morricone soundtrack does best - marries well with what's 
   happening on screen and adds extra emotional depth. The scene where 
   Gemma's wife discovers that her husband isn't dead is one of the more 
   powerful scenes in the genre, and not a word is said.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I was blown away with this one, but the best endorsement I can give 
   it is that even though there's not a great deal of action in the 
   first hour, my ten year old son sat and watched the entire thing.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ciro (played by a guy who looks a bit like Helmut Berger) is a young 
   guy in what might be Naples, grifting while his father runs a 
   restaurant with his mother and younger daughter. Things would be 
   dandy if that damn local mafia weren't sticking their nose into 
   things and demanding protection money of 50 million lire (although it 
   might have been a loan they were wanting paid back, and it might have 
   been 500 million lire - this film had no subtitles and I was 
   translating it live, in my brain, which doesn't function too well at 
   the best of times but after three months of lockdown with the wife 
   and kids is now just running on fumes). These mobsters, led by a fat 
   gobby old guy, want the money as soon as possible, or else.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Not wanting his father to end up dead, Ciro tries to gain the money 
   any way possible, but when it turns out he's not a very good criminal 
   (a robbery ends up with him and his friend receiving spare change, 
   and trying to sell stolen goods almost ends up with him nearly being 
   shot). It's too little too late as not only do some mobsters kick 
   Ciro's dad to death, the shock causes his sister to turn mute! That's 
   unlucky because that only happens in about 50% of these sorts of 
   films. Also, the mafia boss who ordered the fatal beating ends up 
   with a bullet in his head, courtesy of Joshua Sinclair, who plays 
   some sort of 'regional manager' mobster who does a lot of sitting in 
   chairs glowering at things.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's only when Ciro spots the guys who killed his dad that the film 
   starts heading in a <B>ROCKY</B> direction, and it's lucky for him 
   that when he starts hitting these guys really hard in the face he's 
   doing it in front of a boxing manager. This guy takes Ciro under his 
   wing and offers him a promising career punching people for money. 
   Ciro agrees, but the manager does tell him: no tobacco, no alcohol, 
   and no women. That would cause me a problem because Ciro's girlfriend 
   is pouty Stella Carnacina from <B><A HREF="#WhitePopJesus1980">WHITE 
   POP JESUS</A></B>!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's not so much of a training montage as a kind of training plus 
   fledgling boxing career montage as Ciro punches his way through the 
   amateur leagues (do they have boxing leagues? I only watching 
   homeless people fighting with themselves in Glasgow city centre, 
   personally), and when Ciro's career starts to get big, he attracts 
   the attention of none other than Joshua Sinclair.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Joshua (who in real life worked with Mother Teresa and wrote the 
   book Shaka Zulu) sends a spy over to Ciro's camp in the form of sexy 
   sports car driving Nikki Gentile. How much time do you think passes 
   before Stella gets dumped? About ten seconds, as it happens. Little 
   does Ciro know that Joshua is setting him up to fight an English 
   fighter way more professional than Ciro. Can Ciro rise up to the 
   challenge? Will he choose Stella or Nikki? And why did Ciro's mate 
   kiss Ciro on the arm?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This semi-bland film does have a few things going for it, including 
   a funky disco soundtrack and some unintentional laughs. Part of 
   Ciro's training seemed to involve hitting sand with a huge wooden 
   mallet and then running down the middle of a street, causing a 
   traffic jam. Then there was the bit were Ciro bought his mute sister 
   a terrible talking doll that did handstands, and it seemed she 
   started crying because of how crap it was, and then there's the bit 
   where they solve Ciro's love problems over the end credits with a bit 
   of overdubbed dialogue.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The IMDb says this is two hours long, but the version I watched was

    In Dalmatia (modern day Croatia), a bunch of uppity druid-types have 
   attacked the local Roman garrison and wiped out the lot of them, but 
   not before strange creatures take the bodies for some nefarious 
   practise. Back in Rome, the Senate are enraged against this affront 
   to the Roman Empire and send Ettore Manni over there to sort stuff 
   out. Manni's problems are huge - the resident Praetor is a complete 
   asshole who likes to extort money from the people, and his wife is a 
   bigger asshole who has designs on Manni and may be in cahoots with 
   the local mental druid/wizard, who worships a cyclopean entity who 
   can bring the dead back to life. The dead...like that bunch of dead 
   Romans from the start of the film!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The druid in question is John Barrymore Drew Barrymore Snr Jnr, and 
   he's all up for gathering the local warlords together to kick Rome's 
   ass out of Dalmatia. He worships some god who looks like a Thai 
   statue of Bhudda, only with a third eye that can make people go on 
   fire. Barrymore is also lacking in the people skills department 
   because he thinks he can get his own way by babbling a lot of crap 
   and having sidekick Ivano Stacciolli kill everyone who disagrees with 
   him. This strategy does not have long-lasting positive gains.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    With Ettore Manni having to fight off the designs of the praetor's 
   wife, and also having to put the moves on former slave Ida Galli, 
   it's hard for him to find time to take part in the massive battle 
   that happens at the end of the film which involves hundreds of undead 
   Roman soldiers (don't get too excited as they are regular Roman 
   soldiers with a colour filter added), and the regular Roman army. 
   This battle, which seems to pre-empt the trippy visual sequences of 
   late sixties cinema, is quite impressive in scale and just adds to 
   the general 'competent atmosphere' of the film, which regularly 
   verges on horror without quite getting there.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Strangely, Sixties Ettore Manni barely resembles Seventies Ettore 
   Manni. I wonder what happened there. Still, as these films go, this 
   one actually moves quickly and features plenty of violence and weird

    safe to say that the main thing you need to know about gangster 
   Salvatore is that he lets his balls do the thinking for him. 
   Salvatore (played by &quot;Luis Vito Russo&quot;, a.k.a. Gianni 
   Russo)) has a cushy life carrying out drug smuggling in the good old 
   US, but when he's distracted by a bit of tail in a bar (and I was 
   thinking &quot;Wow, he got in there quick&quot;), rival gangster John 
   Bartha does the old switcheroo on the drugs stashed in the car 
   Salvatore was driving. He does finally retrieve the drugs after a 
   shoot out, although how he found out where they were is left a 
   mystery, but the loss of face in the eyes of his mafia superiors 
   means that he's shipped off to Palermo for his own protection.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Here, he is given a bodyguard in the form of loyal Leonard Mann, but 
   Salvatore gets bored after five minutes of hanging around Sicily and 
   wants to start his own business. He's also got eyes on his protector, 
   the wheelchair bound Don Mimi's wife. This is where the film got 
   slightly confusing for me as Don Mimi's wife and another separate 
   lover are very similar in appearance so I kept getting confused as to 
   who was who. Basically, Salvatore wants loads of money to start up a 
   business in Sicily. Don Mimi refuses, and Salvatore plans a heist to 
   get the cash, as well as wooing Don Mimi's wife into the bargain. And 
   the other girl too. And probably those two party chicks he ropes in 
   for his blackmail business.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is a kind of rags-to-riches story for mafia dudes as Salvatore 
   pisses off every single person he could possibly piss off in the mob. 
   He might as well have painted a target on his chest as various hired 
   goons are sent after him to waste him, including big Romano Puppo, 
   who dukes it out with Salvatore in Paris. This film does do a bit of 
   hopping around the place as Salvatore starts off in the US, ends up 
   in Sicily, then goes to London for some blackmailing while trying to 
   secure a deal in France with some guys who just want to pop a cap in 
   his ass.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's not really much plot here but it's entertaining as hell as 
   director Marino Girolami (father of Enzo G[irolami] Castalleri, 
   father of Ennio Girolami, brother of Romolo Guerrieri, grandfather of 
   Stefania Girolami and uncle of Massimo Vanni) throws in loads, and I 
   mean loads of naked women and shoot-outs, so there's nothing to 
   complain about. Acting wise Leonard Mann is the standout as the 
   faithful and stressed out protector of Salvatore who does what he's 
   told but grudgingly so, and the last shots of him in the film is 
   evidence as to how he went on to bigger things.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Strangely, or not so strangely considering the adorable plagiarism 
   of Italian cinema, the soundtrack sounds like <B><A HREF="godfather_1972.htm">THE
    GODFATHER</A></B> theme tune with just enough changed to avoid a 
   lawsuit, and there's also a tune that sounds a bit like House of the 
   Rising Sun for good measure. This film does exactly what it says on 
   the tin - delivers a load of sex and violence in the standard 
   Eurocrime way. Nothing to complain about here whatsoever. I bet Tom 
   Felleghy had no regrets about that scene he did with those two naked 
   ladies. Playing an Englishman who keeps his bowler hat on during sex 
   with two babes is something that would be held in the 'great times' 
   part of the memory banks, although no doubt not shared with the grandkids.</FONT></FONT></P>

    watching this film I've subsequently read, on Wikipedia, that 
   Brunello Rondi didn't really set out to make a giallo at all, and 
   only wanted to use a murder as the set-up to cast a light on how 
   horrible and awful the rich and privileged are. He did get that bit 
   right - the people in this film do come across as a bunch of

    <B>RUN, PSYCHO, RUN</B> is part giallo, part Gothic, and part soap 
   opera, all exclusively set in and around a huge villa owned by George 
   Dennison, who lives there with his wife Claire, his young son Robert, 
   George's sister Eveline, George's mother, George's niece, played by a 
   young Marina Malfatti, a seemingly live-in doctor called Boyd, a nosy 
   priest, and a whole load of hired staff who all love to spy on each 
   other and eavesdrop. That's a lot of characters, and sometimes just 
   about every one of them appears on screen at the same time.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When we first meet Claire she's watching Robert playing tennis with 
   coach Michel Lemoine (from Jess Franco's pile of horse vomit <B><A HREF="succubus_1968.htm">SUCCUBUS</A></B>).
    Michel tries to put the moves on her, but she's having none of it, 
   preferring instead to go back to the house and have an argument with 
   her sister-in-law Eveline, who is staying at the house and basically 
   mooching off of her brother George. That evening, everyone gathers 
   together to listen to young Robert play a Bach piano concerto (and 
   make bitchy comments about it). Claire, who seems reluctant to mingle 
   amongst these snide guests, instead spies on them from another room. 
   Once Robert is finished, she spirits him away upstairs, preferring to 
   watch him fall asleep rather than talk to George's family. Then 
   again, she needn't worry about that anymore when someone kills her 
   and Robert dies falling down a flight of stairs.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One year later and the family, none of whom seem to work and mostly 
   spend their day lounging around, are talking about George's new 
   girlfriend, Anna, mainly because Anna is the spitting image of Claire 
   (another Gothic trait there). Anna also has a young son about 
   Robert's age by the name of Charlie, who has taken to hanging around 
   with a crazy lady who lives on the grounds who was formerly Claire's 
   best friend. Naturally, every single other person in the villa thinks 
   it's not a hugely sensible idea for George to hang around with 
   someone who looks exactly like his wife, and they don't hold back 
   about it either. In one of many scenes involving most of the cast, 
   Eveline calls Anna a slut and Charlie a bastard, then the mother has 
   a go at her too, and her George's niece, and then the priest. The 
   only person supporting George and his plans to marry his wife's 
   doppelganger is Boyd (George Riviere). It could be, however, that 
   Boyd is greatly fearful for his friend's mental health, and is 
   putting his own plans into action...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Oh, and Boyd is sleeping with one of the maids who is sleeping with 
   the butler too and Malfatti is sleeping with Michel Lemoine and 
   Janine Reynaud (from Jess Franco's abomination from the devil's anus <B><A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm#Succubus">SUCCUBUS</A></B>)
    just kind of hangs around smoking and making catty comments about 
   things. Plus it turns out that George and even Anna have their own 
   agendas too, so it's hard to keep tabs on these things. It does come 
   as a relief that some Gothic elements starting appearing too, like 
   someone playing the organ in the middle of the night, and someone 
   pretending to be Claire playing tennis. This would all be much better 
   if the film actually headed in a good direction, but it just kind of 
   fizzles out into a 'is that it?' kind of ending.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm guessing that Rondi is making some sort of statement that upper 
   classes will never accept one of the lower classes into their fold, 
   maybe, or that the upper classes can basically get away with whatever 
   they want to and can manipulate the truth into whatever reflects 
   their own personal vision. Or maybe he just couldn't think of a good 
   ending, because a decent pay off would have been sweet with all that 
   build-up. Some nice camerawork and a good soundtrack ease the pain a 
   bit however, and it's not as bad as his later giallo <B><A HREF="your_hands_on_my_body_1970.htm">YOUR
    HANDS ON MY BODY</A></B>, and nowhere near as good as the classic <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Demon1963">THE

    Cavallone is another one of those Italian directors whose work isn't 
   easily pigeonholed. If I can sound like a pretentious critic type for 
   a sentence before returning to the usual profanity, he has a unique 
   voice among his peers, just like his contemporary (oooh!) the 
   egregious (I wish the internet was working so I could check the 
   definition of that) Elio Petri, the apotheosis of idiosyncratic 
   Italian directors. Incidentally, in the supermarket today I spotted a 
   sweet potato that look exactly like a human testicle. It had all 
   veins up it and was the exact shape and everything.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Cavallone is a bit of a controversial figure, mainly for his film <B><A HREF="#ManWomanBeast1977">MAN,
    WOMAN AND THE BEAST</A></B> (review shortly, and I'm taking one for 
   the team with that film), and <B><A HREF="blow_job_1980.htm">BLOW JOB</A></B>.
    He also directed some obscure giallo called <B><A HREF="#Afrika1973">AFRIKA</A></B> 
   which I tried to watch. I can't remember anything about it, but next 
   to its entry on my 'to watch' list, it says 'this looks shit'.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>THE SALAMANDER</B> is set over the course of a day and bit, is 
   set in Tunis, and involves white photographer Ursula and her black 
   model Uta. I've got to make that distinction because this film seems 
   to be about the white colonisation of the world and Uta's inner 
   turmoil regarding both her relationship with Ursula and her recurring 
   dream where she sees a black man attacked by three men on a beach 
   before they cut his balls off and go after Uta, where eventually 
   Ursula 'saves her'. The two have a strange relationship. The very 
   Aryan Ursula is jokey and sarcastic, where Uta is introverted and is 
   one of those people who says 'nothing' when you ask them what is 
   wrong, but injecting enough nuance into that 'nothing' that it 
   literally means 'everything'. It doesn't stop them getting it on 
   though, in one of the many casual sex scenes in this film (which I 
   remind you just takes place within a day).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Disrupting the brittle harmony is the arrival of psychologist 
   Antonio Casale, who initially seems to be brought in to sort out 
   Uta's moods, but instead starts causing a bit of bother between the 
   two girls. It's also flashback city for the two of them as Uta 
   flashes back to being hassled and (possibly) raped by another model 
   (who might be pre-op transgender? Something might have been lost in 
   translation), and Ursula flashes back to painting certain parts of 
   Uta's body white and making her dance naked in front of an entirely 
   black backdrop. Cavallone is a bit heavy handed on the old messages 
   here, as we get inserted footage of ethnic terrorists being shot 
   (real footage), civil rights rioting, and in a scene that is 
   cack-handed to say the least, Ursula and Uta have a dance-off based 
   on their cultures' music. Ursula dances to typically sixties beat 
   music whereas Uta dances to some bongos and chanting.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's also some guy who turns up lying in the middle of the road 
   who tries to rob Casale, then seduces Uta and slaps her about a bit 
   (more casual sex), before vanishing from the film, which mainly 
   focuses on Casale trying to seduce Ursula. He manages in the end, and 
   hats off to the actress who played Ursula. He's a good actor, as you 
   can see in <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#CaseIsClosed1972">THE 
   CASE IS CLOSED, FORGET</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#CaseIsClosed1972"> </A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#CaseIsClosed1972">IT</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SeventhGrave1965">THE SEVENTH GRAVE</A></B>,
    but let's be honest; he's no oil painting. Kissing him must have 
   been like kissing some sort of weird, clammy Lego brick.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This one has plenty of 'giallo' keywords attached to it on the IMDB, 
   but that side of things doesn't appear until the end, where after 
   some murders, Cavallone decides to totally mess up our heads by 
   throwing in a very strange twist, and then another on top of that. 
   Most people would bail on this film when it becomes apparent that 
   most of it is talking, but I didn't mind that so much. There's was 
   enough weirdness in here to keep me interested.</FONT></FONT></P>

    hi-jinks in Italy with Franco Nero taking on seemingly everyone to 
   stop an upcoming coup-de-tat by the Fascists. When a high-ranking 
   General dies, word on the street is he died of a heart attack, but 
   the truth is he received a bullet to the temple courtesy of a 
   mysterious killer known as The Salamander, a killer who is known in 
   the past to go after Nazis on the run.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I could spend hours detailing the plot here, but let's just say that 
   the death of the general starts the wheels rolling on a coup-de-tat 
   led by new general Eli Wallach, who has far-reaching ties with the 
   fascist underground movement that is stirring into life. It seems 
   that every witness and every person who can expose the conspiracy 
   ends up dead, mostly at the hands of giant torturer Paul L Smith, who 
   is so confident in their success he throws one victim through a 
   window right in front of Franco.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film basically details Franco going from place to place trying 
   to find evidence while constantly nearly getting killed or 
   double-crossed as the masses of billed stars parade across the 
   screen. I wish both sinister Christopher Lee and Eli Wallach had more 
   screen time, but I'm not complaining when we get Martin Balsam as an 
   Italian Jew recounting how buying cigars resulted in him escaping the 
   rounding up of all the folk in the Jewish Ghetto during the Second 
   World War (an act you can watch in the heart-breaking Carlo Lizzani 
   film <B><A HREF="gold_of_rome_1961.htm">GOLD OF ROME</A></B>). Like 
   he did in <B><A HREF="confessions_of_a_police_captain_1971.htm">CONFESSIONS
    OF A POLICE CAPTAIN</A></B>, Balsam acts Franco Nero off the screen, 
   although the two of them interact brilliantly, as they did in the 
   aforementioned film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Other folks showing face is the suave Anthony Quinn as a partisan 
   turned big-shot businessman who may or may not be helpful to Franco, 
   John Steiner as an army sub-ordinate loyal to Eli Wallach and even 
   more loyal to Wallach's wife, Claudia Cardinale, who isn't in this 
   much but is fascinating to watch as a more sinister character than 
   usual, and Nello Pazzafini as Quinn's bodyguard who gets a lot more 
   screen time than usual.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's all by the by, however, because the big event in this film is 
   when Paul L Smith and Franco Nero go up against each other in battle 
   which becomes far more homo-erotic than intended and also quite 
   funny, all because Nero is wearing nothing but a jockstrap and jumps 
   on Smith's back in slow motion, like a hairy short-arsed sumo 
   wrestler is trying to bang a giant scientist. Truly bizarre and not 
   the first time Nero's arse has made an appearance. Some may recall 
   the inexplicable &quot;naked shaving in front of a kid&quot; scene 
   from <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Redneck">REDNECK</A></B>. Maybe 
   he has it written in his contract.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I enjoyed this one but I've got to admit I'd have preferred a more 
   action-packed finale than the Agatha Christie-like reveal we get. I'm 
   not sure this one slipped by me all this time, but then again, Franco 
   Nero is one prolific actor, and there's still loads of his 230+ 
   filmography I have to track down. And I'm tired! Tired!</FONT></FONT></P>

    From the rudimentary research I did about this film it seems that 
   the Piazza San Babila was some sort of hanging around place for 
   fascist types in the seventies. I'm sure they weren't allowed to 
   rampage to the extent that these lads do in this film though.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Fours youths - Franco, Fabrizio, Big Malky and DJ Industrial 
   Pukegrinder are all members of a fascist group whose main rivals in 
   Milan seem to the communists. Fabrizio is their leader, but he also 
   seems to be an informer for the police and may also just be doing 
   what he does for kicks. Franco is the weak link, a mummy's boy and a 
   virgin, much to the amusement of the others. In fact, one of their 
   first actions is to try and break his duck, using ditzy model 
   Brigitte Skay to do so. When he can't crack a fatty, he goes nuts and 
   assaults her with a truncheon. Symbolism, eh?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I think that the events in this film are supposed to happen in one 
   day as well, but if that's the case these guys sure get around a lot. 
   We see one of them fighting with his crazy, abusive father. Another 
   quits his job when caught with a knife. At various points they argue 
   their fascist dogma with fellow students and when they finally get 
   around to doing something constructive they plan an attempt to blow 
   up a communist party headquarters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To be honest things meander quite a lot in this film and as the four 
   are unrelentingly horrible I didn't quite connect to what was 
   happening in the film. My only sympathies lie with Brigitte Skay, who 
   is generally abused by Fabrizio and Franco. Even the murder at the 
   end of the film goes on forever as our four chase a couple around 
   Milan for what felt like about six hours.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Carlo Lazzani seems to be one of those directors who certainly had 
   his own vision for things, but sometimes that vision failed him. This 
   is interesting as it tries to tell a story from a different point of 
   view, but it still suffers from an overdose of grimness as a lot of 
   these 'raping, killing rich kids' films seems to have.</FONT></FONT></P>

   crucifies Sangraal above his village and makes him watch as everyone 
   is slaughtered below, giving us two village massacres in the first 
   twenty minutes of this film, which isn't bad going really. Naturally, 
   Nantuk is rather put out to find that Sangraal has been rescued by 
   wandering guy Hal Yamanouchi (from <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#LastHunter1980">THE
    LAST HUNTER</A></B> and <B><A HREF="zoolander_2_2016.htm">ZOOLANDER 2</A></B> 
   [?]) and Luciano Rossi's daughter, Ati. More annoyed is the Goddess 
   Nantuk worships who cannot stress enough how important it is that 
   Sangraal die, and rather soon if you don't mind, there's a good chap.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's around this time that Hal reckons Sangraal should head up a 
   hill and talk to some disco guy hiding in some fog to go on a couple 
   of fetch quests to pad out the film a bit, so basically the rest of 
   the film features Sangraal, Hal and Ati wandering the land taking on 
   all sorts of bad guys, like the monkey cavemen, or the frog cavemen 
   who splatter blood everywhere when they die (don't get excited - this 
   only happens twice).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   long, which is welcome in my world of constant annoyance and moaning.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Poland, somewhere. A mysterious lady looks out from a coach at a 
   dashing young gentlemen hunting, but the next time we see this fellow 
   he's in a bad way indeed. This fellow is Kamil and it's his friend 
   Wiktor who becomes really concerned that his friend is all over a 
   sudden frail and very sickly looking. Kamil keeps going on about 
   someone called Sara that he's in love with, and Wiktor takes him back 
   to a mansion where this Sara lives. She claims she's looking after 
   the dying Kamil, but then why is she now making go-go eyes at Wiktor?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Shortly after Kamil goes missing, and Sara is putting the moves on 
   Wiktor, who suspects something is deeply wrong about the whole 
   situation. He also keeps hearing weird moaning noises from within the 
   mansion which Sara tries to explain is 'just cats' (you need to work 
   on that Sara), and just as if it looks like Wiktor may fall to Sara's 
   charms just like Kamil, the film takes a bit of swerve into uncharted territory.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Stick with this film, because after a slightly draggy first half the 
   Gothic horror is ramped way up, with a genuinely clever hero for a 
   change. You won't forget what Wiktor finds in the attic of the 
   mansion for starters, plus there's plenty of creepy back up from 
   Julian, Sara's butler/driver. The lighting actually reminded me of 
   the Barbara Steele film <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ghost1963">THE

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">This
    is a hard one to pin down, genre wise, but it's best to look at it 
   as some sort of permeation on Mario Bava's <B><A HREF="danger_diabolik_1968.htm">DANGER:
    DIABOLIK</A></B> film, with the central character being a criminal. 
   However, where Bava's film was full of strange sets and groovy 
   gadgets, <B>SATANIK</B> leans more towards Eurocrime and feels like a 
   Eurospy film, even though the closest it comes to that genre is the 
   suspiciously James Bond theme-sounding soundtrack.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In fact, <B>SATANIK</B> starts out almost in horror territory, with 
   scarred (or diseased?) scientist Marnie Bannister (played by Magda 
   Konopka from <B><A HREF="sky_full_of_stars_for_a_roof_1968.htm">A SKY 
   FULL OF STARS FOR A ROOF</A></B> and the so-so Giallo <B><A HREF="reflections_in_black_1975.htm">REFLECTIONS
    IN BLACK</A></B>) heading to the laboratory to find that her boss 
   has perfected a serum that reverses age. He's tried it out on an old 
   dog, and now has a bouncy young puppy instead (albeit an aggressive 
   one). Speaking of aggressive ones, Marnie isn't too happy that the 
   professor won't try out the serum on her, so she stabs him to death 
   and steals the sample, which turns her into a swinging Sixties chick 
   with the mascara and the lipstick and the wig (if you're having to 
   ask why a serum provides such aesthetic bonuses to the de-aging 
   process, then Italian cinema is going to be problematic for you in 
   the old realism stakes).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Young Marnie, flush with youth and sexy legs, heads off to sniff out 
   trouble. The security guard at the lab reports seeing her flee the 
   murder scene, but the two cops involved take some time to put two and 
   two together, only figuring things out after Marnie has murder 
   high-flying gangster Umberto Raho (who gets a fair bit of screen time 
   here). It's also around this time that Marnie realises that the 
   effects of the serum are temporary, and heads back to the lab to cook 
   up some more. You'd think she would have done that in the first 
   place, and she also only cooks up two more batches, so I guess she 
   was planning to return later to cook up even more...at a place where 
   she murders someone every time she's there.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot kind of stumbles along into the old crime genre where 
   Marnie plans a heist by stealing the identity of a girl she murders 
   and heading off to Geneva, but basically the plot is an excuse for 
   the film to wallow in Sixties excesses - especially fashion. Actress 
   Magda Konopka goes through a LOT of dress changes in this film, many 
   of them of the Paisley pattern and mini-skirt variety. As for the 
   costume she wears on the promotional posters for this one, that only 
   turns up in one scene, where she does a very slow striptease. The 
   second one of the film. So that's two very slow stripteases you have 
   to sit through.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guess <B>SATANIK</B> was never meant to be digested in any other 
   form but that of a film to be enjoyed and forgotten about. There's 
   not much to give it classic status, but then there's not much to get 
   offended about if you like Italian genre films. This is the first 
   film I've watched that's directed by Piero Vivarelli. Looking at the 
   IMDB, the only other film of his that looks interesting is something

    plot involves a terrible plague engulfing the world, and a young 
   couple who have to isolate themselves away from the rest of the human 
   race until things calm down again. Then they make a bunch of annoying 
   Tik Tok videos with them singing uplifting songs that makes me want

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    No, no, they don't do that. I'll start again. Cino and Dora are just 
   a regular pair of annoying hippy types travelling around while the 
   news burbles away in the background about a plague. Like most young 
   folks, they don't really think it's their problem to deal with, and 
   they just kind of get on with being annoying, and hippy like, but 
   everything changes when they are forced to confront the disease in 
   real life. They drive into a tunnel listening to upbeat music, but 
   when they emerge, all they can hear on the radio is incoherent 
   shortwave broadcasts, plus the first thing they encounter is a school 
   bus full of dead children. Shortly afterwards, they are arrested by 
   the military for buying far too much toilet roll. No, wait.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    In a huge dome where a doctor is trying to revive a bloodied woman 
   lying next to an even bloodier child, they are questioned, given a 
   pill that will protect them from disease, and then sent out into the 
   world to find an abandoned building to hide out in. Finding just such 
   a building on a beach, with the director playing a corpse in a chair 
   just outside of it. The two kids settle in and listen to the demise 
   of the earth via radio, where the authorities are trying to rescue 
   the Pope from a destroyed Vatican. Following this, all contact with 
   the outside ceases.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Two people stuck in a house together for ages, with no contact with 
   other human beings sounds like a boring film, but now we've all been 
   trapped in our house for some time, I was positively jealous by what 
   Cino and Dora get up to. Cino turns the lower level of the house into 
   a museum of human artifacts. Dora takes up vegetable growing. A huge 
   whale washes up on the beach. Some people turn up wearing facemasks 
   and make the couple sign a contract agreeing to procreate to help 
   bring back the human race, but then again that's where the trouble 
   starts too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As I've been homeschooling two kids since October, I really don't 
   have the brain capacity to dig out all the metaphors and imagery of 
   this film, but I did find it extremely enjoyable just to watch (and 
   it's there on YouTube, without subtitles, but then this is not a 
   dialogue heavy film). Cino and Dora are a pretty likeable couple, 
   even if Cino becomes more and more feral as the film goes on 
   (definitely something to read into that I'd say). Also, for a film 
   leaning towards the arty, the whole plague set up and aftermath is 
   done pretty well on a low budget, and believe it or not, there's even 
   a bit of gore and cannibalism in this one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The whale was a pretty clever move too - using it decaying to show 
   the passage of time. The ending was completely random and came out of 
   nowhere, mind. I guess it probably meant something, but I'm going to 
   be honest, if I review any more Marco Ferreri films (like <B><A HREF="tales_of_ordinary_madness_1981.htm">TALES
    OF ORDINARY MADNESS</A></B> or <B><A HREF="last_woman_1976.htm">THE

    Carletto, who still lives in the same apartment where the guy died, 
   is the only one who hasn't moved on in life. He's drifted instead 
   into the extreme politics of Italy's 'Years of Lead', becoming a 
   revolutionary artist. The trio being blackmailed therefore lure him 
   into their world of the rich, mainly exploiting his unrequited love 
   for Lea. While they play mind games with Carletto, the blackmailer 
   continues to play mind games with them, but have they really got the 
   right guy?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Almost chronically talky for the first hour, <B>SHAME ON YOU, SWINE</B> 
   does develop into something that holds your interest, mainly due to 
   the mystery of who is blackmailer versus the shock of Carletto being 
   submerged into a word of middle class excesses. Plus, as the film 
   goes on it gets progressively more experimental in approach, as if 
   Carletto's confusion in the world he has previously been denied has 
   partly unhinged his mind. This, coupled with <A HREF="dirty_angels_1969.htm#OST">Ennio

    It's not the greatest film either, but director Mauro Severino 
   manages to produce something that at least has something going for 
   it. It's on the Giallo Realm channel on YouTube, but if you want to 
   watch it you better be quick as that channel gets deleted roughly 
   every fifteen minutes or so.</FONT></FONT></P>

    I'm not sure what year this film is set, but there's no electricity 
   and everyone sits around drinking and being bored, so it's either 
   19th Century Yugoslavia or 21st Century Glasgow. The villagers, 
   mostly wheat farmers, are at a loss as what to do with their crop as 
   something keeps biting the necks out of anyone who works in the local 
   mill. In fact, at the beginning, this is exactly what we get to see, 
   as current miller Vule dismisses the weird noises he's hearing and 
   gets his throat ripped out for good measure. For some reason that's 
   never explained (and a few things in this film aren't), the 
   vampire-creature that attacks him likes to fondle the flour being 
   made. Maybe because they're not happy with the quality of it, so 
   maybe they were some kind of vengeful undead baker or something.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Plot wise we have a young Christopher Eccleston-looking guy who 
   wants to marry the rich landowner's daughter, who will not allow it 
   due to the young guy being unemployed and poor (you can see where 
   that's heading), but most of the film is spent with the villagers, 
   who get drunk, provide some comedy relief, and try and track down the 
   undead creature who is stopping them getting some bread, which also 
   leads to more comedy relief and getting drunk. I may or may not be 
   wrong in saying that a lot of references here may be specific to the 
   area this was made in (be it in present day Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia 
   - who knows?), so I don't know if there is a myth about the undead 
   and butterflies, or whether or not you use a horse to find a grave, 
   or whether or not you poke that horse up the arse with a stick to get 
   it to move.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   just call the police on you. Like the Czech Vampire film <B><A HREF="ferat_vampire_1982.htm">FERAT

    I was in Yugoslavia back when the country was just about to break 
   apart. The economy was haywire, so one day a hamburger would cost 
   38,000 dinars, and the next day it would cost 47,000 dinars. 
   Strangest of all, however, was one night at the hotel we could see a 
   massive electrical storm heading from the sea to the beach. When it 
   reached us everyone ran inside while chairs and tables were blown 
   about. The thunder was deafening and every time lightening struck it 
   was so bright it looked like it was the middle of the afternoon. We 
   sheltered inside in the bar and I looked out to see the hotel's 
   resident band outside, still playing music while this madness was 
   going on. Nutters!</FONT></FONT></P>

   is called <B><A HREF="sinbad_of_the_seven_seas_1989.htm#Sinbad">SINBAD</A></B>

    And the whole thing is just as hilarious.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, this one is directed for the most part by Enzo Castellari, 
   who apparently couldn't be arsed finishing the film which resulted in 
   it being shelved until Luigo Cozzi appeared, gave it some of that 
   'Cozzi magic' (which is why we get to see a shot of Disco Space, just 
   like <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Starcrash">STARCRASH</A></B> and 
   those previous Herc films), and added a <B><A HREF="princess_bride_1987.htm">PRINCESS
    BRIDE</A></B>-like narrative where Daria Nicolodi tells a very 
   confused girl the entire story, which was written by Edgar Allen Poe (really?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Daria's narrative details how the city of Basra was the happiest 
   place on Earth as the Caliph was a good guy and his daughter was all 
   set to marry Prince Ali, one of Sinbad's crew (which also includes 
   Ennio Girolami as a Viking, Hal Yamanouchi as a colourful Chinese 
   warrior and a same sex couple who serve as comedy relief and on-ship 
   duties). All is good until the Caliph's advisor Jaffar (John Steiner, 
   going for gold in the pantomime bad guy stakes) makes the land evil, 
   hypnotises the caliph and sends Sinbad down into the cellar where 
   things become rather funny.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Finding himself in a pit of plastic snakes, Herc, I mean Sinbad, 
   smooth talks these poisonous reptiles into thinking he's their pal 
   and that he won't hurt them. It looked pretty painful to me when he 
   tied the lot of them together to make a rope, so maybe the lesson is 
   that snakes shouldn't trust large-breasted oiled up men. Sinbad then 
   invades a torture room where all his mates are and punches loads of 
   bad guys into a piranha tank (including an uncredited Massimo Vanni, 
   whom he's already punched in the throne room in an earlier melee).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I don't proclaim to have the brains to understand Jaffar's complex 
   bollocks 'five jewels' plan at all, but somehow he's got these magic 
   jewels which he sends around the world, causing the film to descend 
   into video game territory as Hercbad goes off to seek out and 
   retrieve the jewels in various lands, most of them involving some 
   sort of &quot;boss battle&quot; with a ridiculous monster.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Never mind the rest of the plot, just be on the look-out for the 
   various chuckle-tastic happenings assaulting your looking-eyes as the 
   film thunders on. See Sinbad and his mates get attacked by a bunch of 
   zombie pirate monsters. See Sinbad punch a zombie pirate monster 
   right through the chest and pull his heart out. Laugh hysterically as 
   it turns out the zombie pirate monster's heart has a little zombie 
   pirate monster face!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rock monsters, slime monsters, undead knights, nothing is more 
   funnier in this film than John Steiner's turn as Jaffar. Steiner can 
   play subtle bad guys - like Beauty Smith in the <B><A HREF="white_fang_1973.htm">WHITE
    FANG</A></B> <A HREF="challenge_to_white_fang_1974.htm">films</A>, 
   or Rudy from <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#CriminalsAttack77">THE 
   CRIMINALS ATTACK, THE POLICE RESPOND</A></B>, so I can only guess 
   that he made the conscious decision to go way over the top for some 
   reason, maybe just for his own amusement (or maybe because this is 
   primarily a children's film, which is always something to keep in 
   mind when watching them). Whatever the reason is, his finger-jabbing, eye-rolling,
    screaming performance makes the film much more entertaining than it 
   would have been.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    On the whole, Sinbad is not as non-stop crazy as the two Hercules 
   films, but it's worthy enough to be part of the &quot;Lou Ferrigno 
   playing a mythical character in a film involving Luigi Cozzi in some 
   way&quot; genre.</FONT></FONT></P>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Gian
    Maria Volonte plays a man who is seemingly devoid of a soul, a man 
   who will let nothing at all get in his way to produce the results he 
   wants. Volonte is an editor for a right-wing newspaper in politically 
   troubled Milan and even manages to use a petrol bomb attack on his 
   own office as a way to influence the masses to vote the way he wants 
   them to vote in the upcoming elections. Just think what he could have 
   done with Facebook/Twiiter/Whatever they use in the time era you're 
   reading this in!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When a young school girl is raped and murdered, Volonte is 
   practically rubbing his hands together with glee, as he sees it as 
   another opportunity to cast a bad light on the left wing. He's even 
   more pleased when the suspect turns out to be a left-wing radical, 
   and is determined, through hysterical headlines and speculation, to 
   make a scapegoat of the suspect, and his associates, regardless of 
   whether he's actually innocent or not. However, a young, idealistic 
   journalist at the newspaper might spoil his plans...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's stating the obvious, but the main attraction here is Volonte's 
   acting. Nothing, simply nothing, will throw him off his quest to get 
   the exact headline he wants in that newspaper, and it's even hinted 
   that he doesn't particularly have any strong right wing feelings and 
   is just doing it because he can. His meetings with the equally evil 
   industrialist John Steiner are chilling, as they discuss murder in 
   terms of voting predictions. Even Volonte's own family are detached 
   to the point where they barely look at him and merely watch him being 
   interviewed on television as he rants about how stupid they are. I 
   did love his speech about the difference between what people say and 
   what people think. Chillingly true in the time we live in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Laura Betti also puts in a good turn as a witness who is suckered in 
   by Volonte, as does Jacques Herlin, who seems to find all the 
   subterfuge amusing above anything else. In among all this there is a 
   murder to solve too, giving the film a slight giallo flavour which is 
   fitting considering the year it was made.</FONT></FONT></P>

    despairing at the antics of his alcoholic, neurotic wife Patty 
   Shephard, who just lies around in bed all day, getting drunk and 
   doing that derisive cackle that spouses in Euro films seem to reserve 
   for their other half. Stafford rebuffs her advances, and Shephard, 
   Spain's version of Barbara Steele (they look like they could be 
   sisters!), threatens to take on a lover, prompting a seventies slap 
   in the face from Stafford, who flounces off to hang around with a

   guy to just flat out strangle her, which leads to a freeze frame of 
   her face as the credits play along to some funky music, featuring a 
   guitar solo! When Stafford arrives home, he doesn't seem to have the 
   acting chops to act bereaved enough, but he does find a photograph on 
   the floor of the room that prompts a lame giallo plot, so I guess 
   that counts as a win. The murder also gets actor Michel Constantin 
   involved here as the investigating cop, but Constantin the actor 
   looks like he can't be arsed making an effort here, so don't get too excited.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Femi fans will delight in the striptease scenes, but plot fans will 
   despair as somehow Femi knows who the guy in the photograph is, but 
   won't say who it is, but then embarks on an affair with Stafford 
   anyway, and gets involved in some mystery man who shoots someone 
   randomly, which effects her sex life with De Mendoza, which prompts 
   him to hire Stafford to find out why Femi won't get it on anymore, 
   which the sends Stafford off on some hunt for some guy who the police 
   are also looking for, which prompts Femi to accuse an innocent man 
   who then turns insane, which leads to more arguing and now and again,

   There's plenty of nudity from Femi Benussi so I guess fans of her 
   will like that, but the whole film is rather flat and rote, which is

   and finds the last team mate lying naked with a lover, both quite

   see Fujardo come in and stroke the dead girl's breast before catching 
   himself and leaving. Disturbed, Martin finds the jeeps keys but the 
   car is dead, as well as all other cars. Things are looking bleak for

    That's enough plot. This film isn't exactly action-packed, but it 
   was interesting enough and had a pretty creepy atmosphere. Eduardo 
   Fujardo, once again, manages to elevate what could have been mediocre 
   material with a pretty good performance as a man barely holding it 
   together, and barely holding his baser instincts in check, which is 
   one of the themes of the film that's explored in the latter half. The 
   version I watched was only 76 minutes long, and I believe there might 
   be longer version out there on DVD maybe. This might also be one of 
   those 'lost' films that was recently found, but I've got beer to 
   drink so fact checking is not a priority.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For those who watch it and think it's crap, watch it to the end at 
   least, because I found the ending to be particularly freaky and 
   downright weird. Maybe I've got no taste though, because I rooted 
   around some Spanish film sites and the general consensus was that 
   they didn't like it.</FONT></FONT></P>

    know Oliver Twist, right? The kid in this film is, like, MEGA Oliver 
   Twist. Not only is he an orphan, he can't go to school, his adopted 
   mother is terminally ill, they haven't had electricity in their house 
   for three years and have to perform songs in the street for cash, 
   he's also thrown in jail for robbery and murder, and also ends up 
   siding with the Gomorrah. &quot;Please can I have some more?&quot; 
   The kid here doesn't even have 'some' to begin with, let alone the 
   chance to ask for more. And he's only nine. NINE! The only thing he 
   didn't do during this film was go blind, and there was a bit in the 
   toilet in jail where I thought he had.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Gennaro is pretty tough seeing as how his mother is a fallen star 
   singing for pennies, but when she gets ill, they can't afford to get 
   her medicine and that's where Gennaro ends up blackmailing 
   bag-snatchers and ending up with a Fagan-like boss. Sadly, the Artful 
   Dodger of this venture hates Gennaro, and a failed attempt to frame 
   Gennaro ends in the bad guy's death, which leads Gennaro in the dodgy 
   direction of being in jail while his surrogate mother and faithful 
   dog are outside. He doesn't sing a song about his mother that makes 
   everyone cry like Mario Merola would, but he does have a crazy dream 
   about heaven where his surrogate mother is the Virgin Mary!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This insanely bi-polar film swerves from being a comedy (the bit in 
   the hospital where big fat loudmouth Lucio Montanaro does his 
   trademark screaming rant before being crushed by a bus) to severe 
   melodrama as Gennaro's surrogate mother can't get to see him in jail 
   due to not actually being his mother to an outright Eurocrime film 
   involving Gennaro helping gangster Rik Battalgia take down some bad 
   guys. This actually makes the film highly entertaining, because this 
   all adds to the madness and the film is never boring for a second. 
   For all those fans of Naples-based tear-jerkers out there, we have 
   such trademarks as pizza eating, coffee drinking, dinner eating, 
   extremely loud screaming passing for everyday conversation, cigarette 
   selling, boat sailing, singing, traffic problems, people arguing with 
   each other loudly and Gianni Garko as a documentary maker making a 
   film rightly called 'Chaos'. This is Naples in a nutshell and rather enjoyable.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm confused, however, as to who actually put subtitles to this 
   thing. I've had this film on my list for years due to my obsession 
   with watching Alfonso Breschia's love letters to Naples, but never 
   thought someone would actually translate this madness. I think the 
   only two Alfonso Brescia/Napoli-based films I haven't watched is the 
   tear-jerker <B><A HREF="tradimento_1982.htm">TRADIMENTO</A></B> 
   (&quot;Betrayal&quot;), where Mario Merola plays an octopus stew 
   seller, and the one where Mario Merola has to pretend an adopted baby 
   is his wife's natural child. That sounds like a laugh, eh? It would 
   have been funnier if he had to pretend an octopus was his natural 
   child, or something.</FONT></FONT></P>

    always seem to give Demofilo Fidani a hard time, calling him the Ed 
   Wood of Spaghetti Westerns, pointing out anachronisms in his films, 
   driving up to his house and shoving dog shit through his letterbox. 
   He's definitely not on the same level as Ed Wood, although I do 
   recall seeing a van driving about in one of his films (can't remember 
   which one though).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To be honest, I do like it when directors of genre films change 
   things up a bit, especially when it comes to Westerns and Martial 
   Arts films (give me a hilarious Godfrey Ho film over any generic kung 
   fu film), so I quite like that Fidani decided to insert a few 
   head-scratching moments into this film. Strangest of all being 
   director Joe D'Amato taking part in a bizarre egg-shooting contest, 
   but I'm getting ahead of myself here.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film starts with a whole load of bad guys heading into town to 
   rob a bank - including Fabio Testi in his second feature. Three of 
   these guys, led by Carson, go into a bank under the pretence of 
   depositing money but rob it instead. Carson get angry that one of his 
   guys just put a cushion over a screaming woman's face and shot her, 
   but then as they escape town loads of people, including three kids, 
   get killed, so maybe Carson was mad that the guy ruined a perfectly 
   good cushion?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Carson's taken a slug to the neck during the shootout and heads off 
   to hid near White City, where his brother Donavon is in charge and 
   has his own gang. It is in White City that our mysterious stranger 
   arrives, carrying a photograph of a young lady. Our stranger, also 
   known as Frank, heads into the local bar for a beer where most of 
   Donavon's gang are hanging out, as well as local, crippled drunk 
   Ettore Manni and local hooker Trudy. There's also a &quot;What the 
   fuck?&quot; moment when Donavon's son suddenly bursts into the bar 
   riding a horse and firing a gun. He then starts mocking Ettore, which 
   leads to a punch up with Frank.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Besides punching people, Frank is doing a little investigation 
   looking for Carson, which leads to the egg-shooting scene where 
   D'Amato and another guy are tossing eggs in the air and trying to 
   shoot them whilst standing in a huge pile of smashed eggs. Frank 
   fares a little better but I'm not sure if this is what leads to 
   D'Amato and his mate wanting to kill Frank, but this gives Frank a 
   chance to use his bizarre water canteen/mirror/gun combo. And this 
   isn't the last time an everyday object turns out to contain a gun...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's things like that in a Spaghetti Western - little odd moments, 
   that makes the film stand out from the pack. We can all agree that 
   Spaghetti Westerns aren't exactly the most realistic films to begin 
   with. Even <B><A HREF="for_a_few_dollars_more_1965.htm">FOR A FEW 
   DOLLARS MORE</A></B> has that over-the-top hat shooting sequence. 
   They might as well be set on the moon, so when people start pulling 
   out gadgets or weird characters starts appearing, that's the fun zone 
   for me. This film delivers in that respect, whatever you think of 
   Fidani as a director (and while I'm at it, I liked his giallo <B><A HREF="a.a.a._masseuse_good_looking_offers_ her_services_1972.htm">A.A.A.
    MASSEUSE, GOOD LOOKING, OFFERS HER SERVICES</A></B> too!), his films 
   aren't just generic copies of the Leone films. Or maybe they are, but 
   they just turn out all wrong anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    not that strange a story really, but more of a chance for 
   screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi to remix his back catalogue of gialli 
   plot points. It's alright though, but let's play giallo cliche bingo!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    First thing we're ticking off the list today is childhood trauma, as 
   Serena Grandi (from Lamberto Bava's <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#DeliriumGioia1987">DELIRIUM</A></B>)
    is haunted by nightmares of finding her mother's naked body after 
   she shot herself in the head, plus there's some added madness as 
   child Serena then goes on to shoot her father, who enters the rooms 
   as a masked, black-gloved killer, so better tick that one off too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Husband David Brandon (from every Italian horror film from 1985 
   onwards, including <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondDarkness">BEYOND
    DARKNESS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="until_death_1988.htm">UNTIL DEATH</A></B>)
    doesn't have a clue what to do about all this, but as Serena isn't 
   performing too well in the sack he refers her to a psychiatrist, who 
   recommends that she return to her childhood home and face the ghosts 
   of her past, which she does, and right away there's a mysterious 
   motorcyclist wearing a black helmet following her about (tick that 
   off!). We also get a quick close up of an eyeball (tick!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Serena's doing okay at first in her old home, meeting her old maid 
   Mary (why she's still living in the house when no one is there is 
   anybody's guess), her old pal Shiela (Florinda Bolkan), who is an 
   artist an photographer who lives in an arty apartment full of 
   mannequins (tick), and some other people I've already forgotten about 
   (some old guy). Things look shaky at first for Brandon's sexy 
   prospects as Serena does some heavy flashbacking wandering around the 
   house, but eventually he gets her in the sack. I guess he's not 
   caring too much about the post-coital flashback Serena has when she 
   looks out of her back window and more trauma rises to the surface as 
   she sees her father making sweet sweet love in a gazebo (?), but 
   after he notices Serena watching him, he shoots himself in the head.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For some time after this, the plot is mainly focussed on two things 
   - having someone pester and threaten Serena by telephone and parade a 
   whole bunch of suspects before us so we can have a guess at who is 
   carrying out such an act, and following her about as well. We've got 
   sexy cop Micheal (Stephane Ferrara from <B><A HREF="#WhoKillSara1992">WHO
    WANTS TO KILL SARA?</A></B>) who is also Serena's ex-boyfriend, 
   which enrages his current girlfriend Isabel (Daniela Poggi, from <B><A HREF="#MysteryToRules1988">A
    CASE OF MYSTERY</A></B>), who is an erotic dancer in a club owned by 
   a gangster who isn't listed on the IMDb, where Serena also used to 
   work, so she knows the old barman who also gets sucked into all this crap.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'm all for managing people's expectations so let me say right here 
   and now that apart from the opening scene, no one is killed until fifty-three
    minutes into the film. In that time you get a lengthy scene in the 
   nightclub where we get a stripper followed by a very 
   passive-aggressive dance by Poggi to crappy electronic music while a 
   full rock band performs behind her, more phone calls and someone 
   trying to strangle Serena, and probably the same person messing with 
   her head. Poggi threatens Serena with a knife, Brandon looks 
   concerned and then Serena starts jumping in the sack with Michael. In 
   fact, many scenes open with Serena either lying in bed post-coitally, 
   or shortly after being traumatised by some event.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is Gastaldi's second-to-last story, so perhaps he thought he'd 
   throw in everything. Is there a masked killer bumping off people or 
   is there some plot to drive Serena crazy? One thing's for sure - the 
   scene where a character is killed by being brained by an entire 
   mannequin was pretty funny.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's rampant nudity and sex in this one, but the killings take 
   some time to start happening, plus I guessed who the bad guy was. I 
   just remembered I should have been doing that bingo thing throughout 
   the entire review. Oh well. Weirdly, the music was exactly the same 
   as the kind of music you'd expect from a giallo six or seven years 
   prior. That's the only strange thing about this strange story.</FONT></FONT></P>

   on with meddling with nature without some Johnny Foreigner 
   interfering in order to stop the planet being destroyed. Fair enough,

    Forrest Tucker wasn't either, but we tolerate the Yanks due to us 
   joining forces to get it right up Hitler during the Second World War. 
   That doesn't mean to say Tucker gets to be in charge, however. He's 
   only an assistant to scientist Doctor Laird, who's using some nifty 
   post-war science to magnetise metal into disobeying the laws of 
   physics. According to the civil servant overseeing the project, 
   played by Geoffrey Chater (of every single British television show 
   ever made, including blasts from the past such as <B><A HREF="brass_british_tv_series_1983-1990.htm">BRASS</A></B>

   Gerry's taking his pasting, Ivan still lurks behind the iron curtain.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This would be all well and good if Laird's other assistant hadn't 
   gone and electrocuted himself that morning. At short notice, Chater 
   shyly admits they can only supply a woman scientist, which shocks 
   both Tucker and Laird. Luckily she's a hot French chick that Tucker 
   fancies and Laird discovers has quite a brain in her head, so she's 
   what us sensitive types like to call &quot;Swotty Totty&quot;. Sadly 
   she's too good at her job and just quickens Laird's doomsday device, 
   causing an electrical storm at sea, UFOs to appear, and a homeless 
   man to receive radiation burns to his face and go crazy. Oh, and 
   there's the small problem of all the insects suddenly getting really 
   big and chowing down on people. And Laird going crazy.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Luckily, helpy may be at hand in the shape of some guy who appears 
   in the woods. He sounds English. He looks English (except for the 
   beard, which he ditches early), but he ain't English. He's not even 
   human, but he's here to help. That's the hardest thing these 
   hard-drinking, heavy-smoking English people have to face - can they 
   lower themselves enough to listen to some foreigner tell them what to 
   do? That's not how the British Empire bally-well works, damn you.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Everyone, even the alien, likes a nice pint in this one and you 
   can't help but feel at home in the pub where rather a lot of the film 
   takes place. Although slow at first, the sudden turn into giant 
   insect territory was rather good as the pace leaps up a few notches 
   as the army pile in to deal with the creepy crawlies. You even get to 
   see a soldier with half his face bitten off, which was something I 
   was not expecting from a fifties film. Good theremin abuse on the 
   soundtrack too, like in all good old school sci-fi films.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The bugs are mainly just enlarged footage of real bugs with some 
   plastic ones thrown in for good measure. The film isn't very long but 
   contains everything you need from this kind of film. Makes you want 
   to spark up a Woodbine, drink a pint of bitter, play darts and put 
   your feet up on a dead Belgian. Gawd Bless The Queen and all who sail

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">At
    the time of writing this review, Antonio Marsina is seventy-four 
   years old, and I bet there are times when a family member is trying 
   to talk to Antonio and notices that Antonio is just staring off into 
   space, or perhaps a loving grandchild has asked Antonio a question 
   and noticed that Antonio is having what they might construe as a 
   senior moment. It may be even that when trying to choose what kind of 
   bacon to buy in the shops, Antonio starts acting like someone has 
   reached into his brain and flipped the switch to 'off'. There's 
   nothing wrong with Antonio, however. He's simply recalling that 
   magical time in his life when he starred in the film <B>TEMPTATION</B>,
    a film where he got to cavort naked with not one, not two, but three 
   lovely naked ladies for much of the film. Proper naked ladies with 
   pubes and everything that he got to touch and stuff, the lucky bastard.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Antonio is basically the turd in a turd sandwich in this film, which 
   continues with the tried and tested plot of sixties giallo like <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Libido1965">LIBIDO</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="double_face_1969.htm">LIZ AND HELEN</A></B> where 
   rich, sadly oversexed folk mess with each other's heads for some sort 
   of monetary gain, only because this is the late Eighties, the giallo 
   has evolved to involve a lot more sleaze and a lot less blood, and 
   you won't be surprised to find, just like <B><A HREF="nothing_underneath_1985.htm">NOTHING
    UNDERNEATH</A></B> and <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#TooBeautifulDie1988">TOO
    BEAUTIFUL TO DIE</A></B>, this film involves a model agency and a 
   whole lot of shagging. I don't want to underplay that either - for a 
   change Sergio Bergonzelli is unusually focussed on what he wants from 
   this film, and what he wants is female nudity.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marsina is strutting about like a cockerel with its first hard-on 
   because he's shagging the owner of a modelling agency, her husband 
   has just died, and he's suspiciously come into a lot of money through 
   what may be a forged signature of said deceased husband. He couldn't 
   be happier, or could he? He's got a sexy lady and money, but what if 
   he could get his hands on a much younger, sexier lady who seems 
   allergic to underwear? His prayers are answered in the form of 
   Katrine (actress Trine Michelson). She's just passed the audition to 
   be the next cover girl for whatever magazine/modelling thing these 
   people are working on (it was hard to concentrate what with all the 
   nudity), and Antonio wastes no time in giving Katrine a special 
   audition at home while pretending to his girlfriend that he's working 
   late. Subtlety is not Marsina's strong point, because not only is he 
   cheating on girlfriend Anna, he hilariously leaves his front door 
   open, which leads Anna into his living room, where she spots Antonio 
   and Katrine having sex ABOVE her in Antonio's rooftop swimming pool, 
   which naturally has a glass bottom so he can be caught cheating. This 
   isn't the last time this monumentally stupid pool features in the 
   plot either.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Antonio wants to off Anna and get the business for himself, but he's 
   not very good at killing and another problem arrives when someone 
   turns up looking for Katrine - turns out Katrine is a porn actress on 
   the run from her pushy director, and he's got a ditzy daughter trying 
   to get into modelling. Looks like by the end of this film everyone 
   will be wanting to kill everyone else, but I've got to admit director 
   Bergonzelli still managed to take me by surprise with a nice twist in 
   the finale. Thanks for making up for that stupid <B><A HREF="#Trumpet1979">TRUMPET</A></B> film!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Full, and I mean rammed with female nudity, this film isn't boring 
   for a minute, and I'm talking right up close on Katrine and Anna's 
   undercarriage, which probably explains why this film has ten million 
   views on YouTube. Plus Marsina gets to fondle the lot of them. 
   Luckily the giallo element is rather good too, with every character 
   practically being unlikable (except Anna I guess), so you know you 
   have to watch until the end to see who gets their commupence. The 
   cinematography is very giallo-like too, with lots of posed 
   mannequins, and garish colours. A success all round, thankfully, 
   seeing as how I was suffering through a batch of boring films for a 
   while there. The lack of bloody violence might put people off though, 
   but the porn version of those <B><A HREF="#Hercules1983">HERC</A><A HREF="#AdventHercules1985">ULES</A></B> 
   films featured here might lift the spirits a bit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Strangely, due to all these fashion based gialli of the late 
   Eighties, I'm lost as to what I've watched and what I've not. I have <B><A HREF="fashion_crimes_1986.htm">FASHION

    that's cleared up, let's get down to the business of reviewing <B>TEXAS,
    ADIOS</B>. A film where the hero has unlocked the 'infinite ammo perk'.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In Texas, somewhere, a still baby-faced Franco Nero is Burt 
   Sullivan, sheriff who always brings his man back alive. Luckily for 
   us about two minutes after we find that out Nero quits being a 
   sheriff and doesn't seem particularly interested in keeping anyone 
   alive, as he goes after the man who killed his father - Cisco Delgado 
   (Jose Suarez from the awesome Spaghetti Western version of the JFK 
   assassination <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#PriceOfPower1969">THE
    PRICE OF POWER</A></B>). Burt witnessed Delgado kill his father all 
   those years ago, but is having trouble locating the bastard, who is 
   hiding out somewhere in Mexico. That's all well and good, but the 
   main problem is that Burt's younger brother Jim wants to tag along.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jim isn't used to killing bad guys but is a persistent bastard, so 
   Burt lets him tag along until the get to some town in Mexico, where 
   Jim's overzealous questioning of the locals results in him being 
   beaten up and Burt having to shoot up a bar full of bad guys. They 
   also witness the cruelty of a lawless Mexico, as a Delgado associate 
   (Livio Lorenzon, the guy who gets a pillow over his head and shot in 
   the face in <B><A HREF="good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_1966.htm">THE GOOD, 
   THE BAD AND THE UGLY</A></B>. He looks at LEAST in his mid-sixties, 
   but was only forty-three! He must have had a rough life!) executes a 
   bunch of locals and laughs it off.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Sullivan brothers are repeatedly warned off finding Delgado but 
   are helped by a local barmaid who takes a fancy to Jim and gets 
   killed in the process, and a lawyer (Luigi Pistilli) who is preparing 
   to revolt against Delgado. What should really roll out as your basic 
   revenge film starts getting a bit complicated as the bad guys have a 
   lot more depth than usual and there's a few secrets to be revealed 
   that complicate things for a little bit at least before the usual 
   bloodshed and death.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's no classic, but the constant grim violence, revelations, and 
   regret displayed by the antagonist's older selves add a little more 
   dimension to this one. Delgado is cruel but has hope in an offspring 
   making a decent life. Lorenzon is revealed to be a broken man working 
   for the guy who killed his family, who sees no way out of his 
   situation. Strangely, the only person here with not much to do is 
   Nero, who is mostly a single-minded hardcase out to get the guy who 
   killed his father. Alberto Dell'Acqua is the one who gets to emote 
   more as a young guy faced with a reality that's pretty grim.</FONT></FONT></P>

    suspect this Renato Polselli written old-school giallo may have been

   the fashions, but who knows really?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's that tried and test plot of folks, in a huge villa, playing 
   mind games with each other that results in murder, but I mentioned 
   Renato Polselli, didn't I? That means that the entire plot of the 
   film is just something that happens in the mind of wandering hippy 
   bard Mark Damon, just while he's strolling around Rome with a guitar 
   slung over his shoulder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In Mark's brain plot, he's a groovy writer but hasn't been 
   successful, so he hits on a plan, but not before spouting a lot of 
   bollocks and soaking a budgie/parakeet's wings underneath the shower 
   in order to make some symbolic gesture about something, and believe 
   me, talking bollocks is the order of the day for this film. You see, 
   Mark meets up with old flame Robin (Femi Benussi, from <B><A HREF="deadly_inheritance_1968.htm">DEADLY
    INHERITANCE</A></B>), and finds out that her latest lover is a hot

   get his book published.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He paints flowers all over Robin's body and called her lover Pierre, 
   telling him that Robin is sick. Pierre arrives with his assistant in 
   tow (or lawyer, I had to watch this one in Italian so things are bit 
   hazy) and leans over Robin's naked body only for Mark to start taking 
   pictures of him. The plot now revealed, Pierre and his assistant kind 
   of hang around the villa, which is suddenly invaded by a bunch of 
   those irritating hippy types that permeate all films of this era. 
   Playing their guitars, having sex in public, no doubt stinking of 
   body odour and covered in lice. And crabs.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, there is a diamond in the rough in the form Polselli 
   favourite Rita Calderoni, and she's giving the glad eye to Femi while 
   Mark sits in a corner, broody and jealous. The hippies start going on 
   about peace and love and the assistant starts going on about War and 
   Peace, until finally the hippies vanish except for Calderoni, so all 
   sorts of sexual misunderstandings, betrayals, murders and suicides 
   can start happening...in the last fifteen minutes of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Until then it's all talk with some nudity thrown in. There's also 
   some slight Polselli madness in the form of a huge metal gate that 
   can cut off a certain part of the living room, trapping people 
   inside. The version I watched also made things more difficult with a 
   badly damaged print with a <A HREF="nurse_witrh_wound_album_covers.htm">Nurse
    With Wound</A>-like horrible grinding noise for the last ten 
   minutes, although my general philosophy is that you've got to watch

   be a Blu-ray of this coming out any time soon.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dominique Erlanger plays a messed up young artist who has just 
   broken up with her married lover Michel Lemoine and seeks to lose 
   herself in her art. Travelling from Strasbourg to Paris in a very 
   packed train that would give any COVID-era person anxiety, she ends 
   up in Paris, where she asks a waiter if there's somewhere she could 
   rent a room for a while. In a remarkable coincidence, an old lady 
   appears and offers her a room at her house, which has been kept empty 
   since the death of her sister. It's also very cheap, and the ominous 
   comment that the old lady makes into the camera makes us suspect that 
   we may be in for a film similar to <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">CAR FUMES 
   OF PAUL O'GRADY ON SMACK</FONT></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Taking up the offer, Dominique moves into the room and discovers 
   that there's a strange door that she can't get into. The old landlady 
   tells her she better not go in there, which means that very soon 
   Dominique is definitely going there. You see, Dominique likes to 
   paint shitty pictures of spirals and eyes, but she isn't very 
   successful at it. She goes to see her brother's colleague who 
   prescribes medication for her, but also weirdly has a portrait of his 
   wife on the wall who pretty much is Dominique. Just like Edwidge 
   Fenech in the film <FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>CALL THE BOLLARDS OF THE NARC</B></FONT> 
   (also known as <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">HAIR GUMMING TO PET HUGH</FONT></B>),
    Dominique may be involved in something supernatural.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This notion is supported by what Dominique faces when she opens that 
   strange door. Beyond is just nothing but darkness. Impenetrable 
   darkness. Dominique goes inside, scared at first, but then eventually 
   she's inspired by the darkness and begins painting in there, 
   producing what the plot line tells us is much better painting of 
   spirals and eyeballs, but what looked to me like marginally less 
   shitty paintings of spirals and eyeballs. Oh, well.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Somehow this makes Dominique more ambitious and she starts selling 
   her paintings at inflated prices and getting more confident. She also 
   dresses up initially like the portrait in the doctor's room and then 
   more like a vision she has in the void, which becomes increasingly 
   surreal as the film goes on, kind of like the Jean Sorel film <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">ABORT
    SHITE OF THE ASS BALLS</FONT></B>, but really resembles the plot 
   from recent horror film <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">WET GOUT</FONT></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It takes a while to get to the weird stuff, but as the film is 
   fairly short I'm going to cut it some slack, as there are plenty of 
   strange visuals on display, future images in the dark room that 
   Dominique is compelled to copy, surreal conversations with cartoonish 
   backdrops, trippy foreboding scenes that cut jarringly into something 
   else. If you go into this one expecting something like <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">NOSE
    HAIRY'S MAYBE</FONT></B> or <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">WON'T COOK COW</FONT></B>,

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the beginning, as they say. We get an explanation regarding a 
   creature known in Icelandic folklore as the Tilberi. Legend has it if 
   you take a human rib, wrap it in sheep's wool, hold it between your 
   breasts and pour wine on it, a Tilberi will be in your service. Such 
   a creature will then obtain milk from rival farms, bringing you a 
   'bellyful' to which you cry 'let it out son!'. As long as you keep 
   the Tilberi fed from the nipple growing out of your thigh (!!!), the 
   Tilberi will be obedient. If not...expect violent retribution.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Iceland, 1940. The island is occupied by the British Army, a 
   Scottish Regiment by the sounds of it (either that or instead of 
   switching on my television I opened my living room window instead). 
   Religious fellow Audun is tasked by a priest to find the priest's 
   daughter, whom he used to attend chapel with. The priest tells him 
   that she's kicking around Reykjavik, so Audun signs up to help the 
   British Army lay defences for a possible invasion. While suffering 
   the verbal abuse of a Regimental Sergeant Major, who calls him a 
   &quot;Little Eskimo Fucking Leper&quot;, he meets a very strange 
   officer in the form of Major Tilbury, who seems to sleep in a giant 
   mousehole and gives him some chocolate.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Later, Audun is walking around looking for Gudjun (the priest's 
   daughter) when he spots Major Tilbury floating face down in a 
   swimming pool. As he approaches, Tilbury jumps up and vomits gallons 
   of green butter all over Audun, laughing his head off. Audun slopes 
   off, still not having found Gudjun. Later, however, he sees her down 
   in the local graveyard, with Tilbury sucking on her thigh...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    For a country that serves fermented shark you can't eat without 
   drinking vodka first, and smoking salmon in dried sheep shit, Tilbury 
   is still a very strange film. Half satire, it piles on the weirdness 
   as Audun watches mutant Tilbury walk around like a senior Army 
   officer while his subordinates act like he's normal, even though he

    As an epidemic ravages Italy (why does that sound familiar?), the 
   ruling party head away to a religious retreat for spiritual 
   cleansing. This clinical place, full of white sculptures depicting 
   various scenes from the bible, is run by Don Gaetano (Marcello 
   Mastrioanni, and if he's acted better anywhere outside this film, 
   I've not seen it), a self-confessed 'bad priest' who by definition 
   also ensures the longevity and strength of the Church. Don Gaetano is 
   superficially a pious, hot-blooded religious man determined to help 
   the politicians cleanse their souls, but he also seems to give drugs 
   to various guests, plot with others, and have a special bond with 
   Gian Maria Volonte, whom the others refer to as 'The President'. 
   Since watching this film I've discovered he's playing a parody of the 
   then President Moro, whom he would later actually play in the film <B><A HREF="#MoroAffair1986">THE
    MORO AFFAIR</A></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Volonte also has his wife secreted away in his room, and they have a 
   very complicated relationship where his wife (Mariangela Maleto) is 
   more like his mother. Volonte is also a man of two sides - his 
   outward persona is that of a scared, anxious man looking for 
   absolution, whereas inwardly he seeks to destroy his enemies and 
   seize power. There's many a shady dealing going on between Volonte 
   and his inner circles, Gaetano and Volonte's superior, and a maverick 
   called Voltrano who seems to have a whole lot of damning evidence 
   against everyone.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Oh, and most of the film takes place in a complicated science 
   fiction-like underground bunker full of mass surveillance and the 
   film takes a right turn into outright weirdness when it develops that 
   there's a murderer among the politicians. When the bodies start 
   piling up (and they really do start piling up), it becomes clear that 
   someone has an ulterior motive. But what does it all mean?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Don't ask me. However, the endlessly inventive camera work, clinical 
   set design, arty visual composition, and especially acting, won me 
   over right from the start with this film. Elio Petri always made 
   something interesting, and this one is outstanding. Volonte and 
   Mastrioanni seem to be trying to outdo each other here, with 
   Volonte's bipolar pious/scheming character and Mastrioanni's 
   effortless conveying of Don Gaetano's razor sharp mind just bursting 
   out of the screen every time they start glaring at each other.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    was suckered in by this one because the concept is so monumentally 
   stupid and sexist. Satan needs more lost souls for hell and has the 
   great idea of having two of his minions go to Italy to convince women 
   to go about topless, therefore corrupting them and sending them on 
   the path to Hell, where Satan can watch them do a little striptease 
   before consigning them to an afterlife of never-ending torment. He 
   does this because he wants to be rewarded some golden horns as his 
   medal collection is well out of date (he has medals for causing

    Satan's vision is for all the ladies in the world to go topless, 
   because what he likes to do is sit on his throne with all his devil 
   minions and watch women cavorting in front of him while some other 
   devil guy bangs a tambourine and laughs incessantly. Then Satan 
   laughs incessantly. Then all his minions do the same which had me 
   thinking that I had suddenly found myself in some sort of personal 
   Hell where everyone is laughing and a film that clearly advertises 
   that there's going to be topless ladies in it doesn't even feature a

   giving a brief description of their whereabouts, be it Sicily, 
   Venice, Ischia or wherever. Mostly what happens is they convince a 
   woman to wear their special topless top, only for things to go wrong 
   and some Three Stooges slapstick to occur, only not funny, like when 
   the Three Stooges did it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Featuring at least six or seven striptease numbers in hell while 
   Satan and his minions drink fire from skulls, <B>THE TOPLESS WAR</B> 
   gives the impression that women are a bunch of easily manipulated 
   morons whose only goal in life is to look good for their husbands or 
   the general public, who easily fall into love triangles or just plain 
   debase themselves for masculine pleasure. Most of the girls here 
   appear topless, only with something covering up their nipples. and 
   none of them have any character at all - they are simply there to 
   strip off for the camera, giggle, and be protected by male counterparts.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Strangely, the set design for the film is amazing. I can't help but 
   feel that some set from a peplum film was nicked for this, as Satan's 
   lair is huge and expertly designed. Then again, who knows when it 
   comes to Italian cinema. This is cinema trash at it's trashiest, and

    bad action film from Fabrizio De Angelis. Some people may be 
   offended by the film's blandness and lack of excitement, but the 
   awful acting, predictable plot, bad continuity and zero effort 
   dubbing pushes everything into the unintentionally funny territory. 
   Just check out the dubbing of the singer in the country band in the 
   bar - it's brilliant! Somehow the usual dubbing guy who isn't Nick 
   Alexander has taken it upon himself to sing country and western songs 
   in the background of one scene in such a half-arsed fashion I'm not 
   sure I even picked up a single bit of the dialogue I was supposed to 
   be listening to!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now, no one could ever claim that Antonio Sabato Snr was that great 
   an actor, but have you seen Junior Sabato in action? If you have, it 
   probably means you accidentally switched your television channel to 
   Sy-Fy by accident, because mostly he appears in the terrible CGI 
   monsters movies on there, and no one in their right mind, including 
   his dad I imagine, would actively seek out his work. Here, he plays 
   some young jerk who rescues a nun called Aurora from dirty rich 
   businessman Lou Castel, goes off for a while, then comes back to town 
   to help some old drunk mine for gold. Aurora is now a floozy, Castel 
   wants revenge, and Sabato finds himself accused of murder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The budget here looks like it was collected the day before filming 
   in a charity can collection at a mildly busy train station, and I'd 
   imagine the actors weren't paid much, which would explain both Castel 
   and Warbeck's phoned in acting. It's hard to tell what Sabato's 
   trying to convey as his acting spectrum runs from 'constipated 
   scowling' to 'granite statue' to 'painting of a man with no 
   expression'. I was totally confused as he got all uppity that Aurora, 
   who he'd met only once, was a bit of a goer, but then the next minute 
   he was into her. I did find it funny when they shared a bottle of 
   whiskey together, then went off to fly in a plane, and threw the 
   empty bottle of whisky out of the plane in mid-flight. Ah, care free 
   young love.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even the action sequences are flat and filmed as if director 
   Fabrizio De Angelis was shouting instructions from a toilet while he 
   was having a shit. Yet still, the general crapness of it all worked 
   for me. I think I have some sort of bug mind you, so for all I know I 
   just dreamt this entire film in a fever. Best bit was when floozy 
   girl tells Sabato Junior she's going to hitch out of town, and then a 
   car immediately pulls up behind her and offers her a lift.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   word being &quot;Mariella&quot;. Simon's brother isn't too happy 
   about what happened, although hot chick Malisa Longo is pretty 
   nonchalant about it. The reasons aren't quite clear yet, but they 
   will be, as following the operation, Eduardo has woken up and spoken 
   his first word: &quot;Mariella&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Yes, it's one of those deals. Eduardo seems to totally recalling the 
   life of Simon, which leads to many flashbacks as we find out what 
   exactly happened to Simon. Eduardo's wife (Nuria Torray) is 
   understandably upset, but the increasingly sinister Wolff assures her 
   that there's just a bit of the old tussling going on in Eduardo's 
   skull, what with the bit of new brain in there and such like, and 
   he'll be fine soon enough once he stops wandering around saying 
   Mariella and shit. Then he orders folk to keep a close eye on Eduardo.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Due to the memory thing, quite a lot of this film plays out more 
   like a crime film (or even, one of Mario Merola's crime/drama deals - 
   the flashbacks are even filmed at Cerata, same place Mario made his 
   first film). Back when Simon's brain was still in his head, we find 
   that he was just a humble lad in a seaside town, madly in love with 
   Silvia Dioniso. He wants to marry Dioniso but he also wants to earn a 
   fortune first to give her the good things in life, so for now he's 
   following in his brother's footsteps and heading off to England for a 
   while, not knowing his brother has fallen in with a gang of English 
   gangsters who want pull a heist.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Simon is a good guy though, and decides to head back home. However, 
   cheeky Malisa Longo puts the moves on him and before you know it 
   Simon is back in the gang, but what went wrong and why he died I'll 
   leave up to you to find out (unless you've got literally anything 
   better to do). When Eduardo has a flashback he usually retraces his 
   steps, so you get to see him wandering around London being confused, 
   saying &quot;Mariella is waiting on me&quot; and sweating. One place 
   he goes is Piccadilly Circus. You know, the site of the flashy 
   advertising boards that appears in every film set in London? I made 
   it down to London a few years back and went there, all excited to see 
   something I've seen in so many films, only to find out they'd 
   replaced it with a huge digital screen...that wasn't even working. Bastards.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film contains no nudity or gore and very little violence 
   indeed. One character dies of heart attack, and there's only three 
   deaths in the film. Eduardo doesn't turn into a raving killer to get 
   revenge on the gang (that would have been a good idea to put in 
   there), and just...looks confused and scared. Luckily for us Eduardo 
   Fujardo pulls off the role, so we do kind of feel sorry for the guy I 
   guess, but it's a strange choice to dilute the tired brain transplant 
   story and have a film in which nothing much really happens. Oh well. 
   Nuria Torray sure is pretty though, and I guess there's plenty of 
   Spaghetti Western faces to spot throughout the film.</FONT></FONT></P>

   film in front of you and some assholes are having a conversation that 
   gets in the way of the dialogue and infuriates you? Mario Schifano 
   does that in the film itself, so for the majority of the film there's 
   an ongoing conversation rambling on about subjects that crop up in 
   every single Italian film made over the next decade: politics, 
   religious, sex, imagery, cinema and America's influence on 
   everything, carrying on from scene to scene and only ending 
   temporarily before commencing again in a migraine inducing cinematic 
   manifestation of mental illness.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Not that it matters, because there is no narrative structure to this 
   film at all. People lie on beds and ramble on about the above 
   subjects. A Canadian is interviewed (in English) which pours more 
   empty into the void of this film's artistic intentions. The director 
   walks through Rome. The director walks through a park. The director 
   drags some film reel up a flight of stairs. The director paints a 
   man's hand green. The director shakes a bottle of coke at the camera

    Giallo of the mysterious nature as unlikely 'hero' Andrea, who is a 
   surgeon who now fears his instruments and also has trouble using his 
   personal instrument, much to the hilarity of his annoying young wife 
   Barbara, who ridicules him every time he tries it on with her and 
   fails. Trying to get himself together, he sets off for Istanbul with 
   his wife, his mate Omar, and his assistant Sylva. Once there, Andrea 
   starts boozing heavily and staring at the sea, mumbling stuff while 
   Barbara does some dancing to a tune that sounds a lot like Iron Butterfly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's hard to describe the plot because half the stuff that happens 
   may not have happened at all, but let's give it a try. Omar explains 
   that the house belonged to a friend of his, a sculptress named 
   Claudine, who killed herself but then may not have killed herself. 
   Omar then has a vision of Sylva hanging from a tree while the creepy 
   maid arranges drinks on a plate with the signs of the zodiac on it. 
   Andrea can't get it up with Barbara and Barbara seems to be hitting 
   it off big style with Sylva, as we get a couple of montage scenes of 
   them running around Istanbul. Around this time some unknown person 
   attacks a stone triptych with three faces on it and smashes one of 
   the faces to pieces. Plus, there's two guys following Andrea 
   everywhere, one of whom wants to kill him.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Andrea turns out to be the main focus of the film and the whole 
   thing (I guess) might have something to do with his impotence? Or is 
   Claudine really coming back and inhabiting the body of Sylva, who 
   starts dressing and acting like Claudine about halfway through the 
   film. The line between reality and dream becomes further blurred to 
   the point where even Andrea looks confused about what happened in the 
   last ten minutes of the film. The whole film is off the wall, with 
   many characters suffering from visions throughout the film. I thought 
   this had something to do with the maid putting something in 
   everyone's drinks, but then that was never explained either so who 
   knows? And what was that bit where Sylva struts down the street with 
   that marching band? Or that creepy camera shot while Andrea and the 
   maid are playing chess?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">It's
    like director Sergio Bergonzelli simply can't tell a story straight. 
   Here, he takes the usual heist plot and mixes it with elements of 
   comedy, sleazy sex, a slight supernatural bent, strange characters 
   and mixes it with vivid dreams, flashbacks that weren't required in 
   the first place, and an ending that goes on five minutes longer than 
   it should have. I hope that doesn't tempt anyone because this film 
   was a bit of a slog.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Some greedy millionaire likes collecting ancient works of art 
   illegally, and now requires a bronze statue held in a museum in 
   Delphi, Greece. To do this he sends his minion to get together a gang 
   to carry out the heist, including our hero, Lakis Komninos, 
   blackmailed into the heist due to his being on the run from the law. 
   Next our minion, who is one of THREE characters in this film who 
   giggle incessantly, recruits a rich playboy in order to use his yacht 
   to transport the statue away. We also have the drug addicted, 
   alcoholic Colonel, from whose house they will be tunnelling under the 
   museum. I've lost interest describing characters so let's just say 
   there's three other guys, one with a ridiculously high voice, and 
   another played by the guy who bummed that serial killer at the end of <B><A HREF="island_of_death_1975_amazon_posters.htm">ISLAND
    OF DEATH</A></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plan is to tunnel down into an ancient aqueduct, then into the 
   museum's cellar, where they will cut through the floor and lower the 
   statue into the cellar. Obstacles are numerous - they have to cover 
   up the noise of the drilling, the statue is protected by an acoustic 
   alarm and Lakis unfortunately notices that the assistant architect at 
   Delphi is his ex-girlfriend. Also, everybody hates everyone, probably 
   because of all the cackling and giggling. I mean, why have a 
   character in your film that cackles like a witch when you can have 
   another guy who laughs like a chimpanzee?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's the basic plot, but Bergonzelli sees fit to tack on a 
   sub-plot with Karin Well hired by the minion to put the moves on 
   Lakis in order to spy on him, which leads to a fairly lengthy love 
   scene (you see lots of Well, if you're interested). This also leads 
   to Well falling instantly in love with Lakis, having a dream where 
   everyone double-crosses and murders each other (which would have been 
   a better ending), getting caught being a spy by Lakis, working her 
   way back into bed with him again, which leads to yet another love 
   scene, almost the exact same as the first one, only this time set to 
   music stolen from <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CaseOfTheBloodyIris">THE 
   CASE OF THE BLOODY IRIS</A></B>! This sub-plot also leads to some 
   serious questions that are never answered later on, and ends in a 
   truly head-scratching manner.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then there's the archeological dig that suddenly unearths an ancient 
   tablet which reads like a prophecy regarding the robbery which hints 
   that something supernatural might arise from the plot, but then never 
   does. It's like Bergonzelli made things up as he went along and kept 
   his options open regarding whether he should make a comedy or a 
   violent crime film. The ending certainly smacks of comedy, but a lot 
   of the film involves the cast in a cellar, arguing about stuff and 
   isn't funny at all.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guess another reason for all the random crap is that the heist 
   plot didn't stretch to a full movie so he just stuck some random 
   things into the script to pad it out. Whatever's going on here, I 
   suggest you give it a miss. It's had over one hundred thousand views 
   on YouTube so guess there's either a following for the film out there 
   or there was just one guy who really liked that bit where you saw 
   Karin Well's arse and fanny.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">We
    are told at the start of <B>TUNKA THE WARRIOR</B> that the world was 
   destroyed by nuclear war and the remnants of humanity live on a 
   mysterious island, but as the film played out I got the distinct 
   impression that nothing bad happened to humanity at all and someone 
   out there used nuclear war as an excuse to dump a whole load of 
   remarkably stupid people on an island and leave them to it. The 
   characters in this film are as thick as fuck.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It took me a while to get my head around things, but as far as I can 
   tell, there are three different tribes living on the island. The 
   all-female Selenians (Damn them! Damned Selenians), who oppress the 
   all-male Salenk tribe who can't escape from a valley because some law 
   written down somewhere says they can't (Damn them! Damn Salenks, and 
   their village, which is called Six for no reason). The other tribe is 
   another all-male tribe called the Tazaris, and they have designs on 
   the Selenians, because they are a bunch of stupid women. The Tazaris 
   attack the Selenians and steal some women, and the Selenians fight 
   back with hand-bags and guilt trips, to no avail. Damn Tazaris, who 
   bicker endlessly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now, nearly everyone on this island obeys randomly made-up laws that 
   make no sense, and one of these stupid laws is that Selenians cannot 
   enter Tazari land because if they do they will be cursed, so instead 
   they send their chosen Salenk champion to go instead. That's right - 
   they send one guy to go and take on an entire tribe. Surprisingly, 
   this doesn't work, as the guy gets his face mangled by an eagle and 
   murdered in about ten seconds. The defeated Selenians then take his 
   corpse and throw it in the sea. At least they try to, but if you 
   watch the film you'll see that the dummy they throw barely clears 
   three feet before just stopping at the top of the cliff.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Despite him being thrown in the sea, his fellow tribesman retrieve 
   his body. This is where Tunka comes in. Looking like he should be 
   playing rhythm guitar for Status Quo, Tunka is the brother of the guy 
   who just died, and he's out to avenge his death, thinking the 
   Selenians killed him in one of their ceremonies. Damn ceremonies. 
   Making my damn brain hurt. Damn!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Tunka somehow manages to navigate his way from Six to the Selenian's 
   camp, which everyone is surprised at because...you know...it is 
   written that he couldn't do that. This is about the same time my head 
   began to hurt trying to understand the logic behind the laws of this 
   crazy island. It seems that the Selenians like to put the Salenks 
   through trials where most of them die because to die at a woman's 
   blade makes them not worthy to be warriors to fight on behalf the 
   women, but if the women where originally superior to the men in 
   combat, why do they need to train a guy to fight on their behalf. And 
   why do the Tazari spend most of their time berating each other for 
   being 'as weak as five old women'? The fact I can write so much about 
   this shows you how much of the film involves the brain-damaged 
   politics of this island, which is like what would happen if the cast 
   of <B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B> all 
   simultaneously suffered head injuries.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It also means that in the action department things are lacking and 
   Tunka himself doesn't actually do much, except go the the enemy camp 
   to find the imprisoned women, get caught, kill two guards, and then 
   get caught again! The only character that displays any intelligence 
   is his dwarf sidekick. The bad guys have a dwarf sidekick too, but he 
   mostly gets slapped about for no good reason.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Apart from the three tribes, there's also this guy who wanders 
   around the place screaming about prophecies and what-not, but to me 
   he was just like those guys you used to find in Glasgow city centre 
   standing under a bridge having a fight with someone who wasn't there. 
   Due to Coronavirus, I'm only about half a step away from that state 
   myself. Damn those invisible bastards! Probably ghost Jess Franco, 
   trying to donk up my life with Lina Romay's ghost pubes! They have

    Tunka the Moron is a stupid film filled with stupid incidents and 
   the highest use of the word Damn I've ever witnessed in a film, but 
   as a bad movie it's definitely worth a watch due to the bad dialogue, 
   terrible fight sequences, and fascination with people following

    Strano seems to be an odd choice for a hero in a Eurocrime film. 
   With hair like late Irish Eurovision Song Contest presenter and 
   all-rounder Terry Wogan matched with a horrendous, ill-fitting suit 
   and a huge kipper tie, he's about as far removed from Maurizio Merli 
   as you can get. In fact, he reminds me of this guy we used to see 
   outside the gates at school who would always be having an argument 
   with himself. More surreal still is the matching of this guy with a 
   bad guy played by Italian Guido Leontini, who also resembles a 
   long-term unemployed man who owns one set of clothes and spends his 
   time between a bar, a bookkeepers, and the local job centre. You know 
   the type - they smell of overused vegetable oil and cheap tobacco and 
   always tell stories that go &quot;So I fuckin' says to him...&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film comes from the outer reaches of Italian cinema and it's 
   very hard to find information on it, so let's go ahead with the plot 
   and get it over and done with. Dino Strano plays a struggling writer 
   who cannot afford to keep his lover and secretary Silvia, so she ends 
   up turning to prostitution. Strano also has a shady past where he was 
   a button man for the mafia in Sicily, but a kindly Don set him up on 
   the road to fame with the writing, which led to nothing. Now, Strano 
   wants Silvia to give up being a hooker and return to him, but he has 
   her pimp Piero to contend with.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Piero I guess is just thinking of his finances, but this prompts a 
   war between Piero and Strano which starts off innocently enough with 
   a punch up and Silvia being smacked around, but the next thing you 
   know Strano is turning up at Piero's club to beat him up and Piero is 
   putting a couple of slugs in Strano's leg. This sparks off the 
   interest of policeman Luigi Pistilli (I'm guessing so, because the 
   otherwise good Pistilli looks bored out of his mind here), and when 
   Piero is killed in a hit and run, Pistilli thinks Strano has 
   something to do with. Then again, he was in hospital, so who did do it?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's about then Guido Leontini, another gangster connected to the 
   same gang as Piero, contacts Strano. Now I've got to admit that 
   something got lost in translation at this point for me, but Strano 
   ends up owing the mob a lot of cash (either compensation for Piero or 
   paying to keep Sylvia off the streets). Strano, while pretending to 
   make the money required while also setting up a double cross, also 
   falls in with a young artist lady whom he puts the moves on. I 
   thought this melted Johnny Cash-looking mofo was loyal to Silvia, but 
   there you go. It was the seventies after all.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guess I should mention that Gordon Mitchell is supposed to be the 
   head of the crime syndicate, but he's in the film even less than 
   Luigi Pistilli. In fact, there is no other actor better than 'doing a 
   Kinski' than Gordon Mitchell (excepting Kinski himself). &quot;Doing 
   a Kinski&quot; involves appearing in the film as little as possible 
   while taking top billing and the wages that go with it. Check out the 
   film <B><A HREF="gangsters_law_1969.htm">GANGSTERS</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="gangsters_law_1969.htm">'</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="gangsters_law_1969.htm"> LAW</A></B>.
    It's a very <B><A HREF="reservoir_dogs_1992.htm">RESERVOIR DOGS</A></B>-like
    film where Kinski barely interacts with the cast at all. There are a 
   few Westerns like that too with him reacting to shots off-screen like 
   Godfrey Ho is behind the camera. John Ireland was bad for this too, 
   and much later in the lifetime of Italian cinema, Maurice Poli and 
   Paul Muller.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What happens in this film is that Strano takes things too far and 
   gets a severe beating for his troubles which results in him having a 
   ruptured liver (and being pissed on). Now he's got a limited amount 
   of time to sort everything out before he dies, so it's a pity that 
   besides the odd brief bit of violence, this film waits one hour and 
   fourteen mintues in before including any proper kind of action. 
   Before that it's just talk, talk, talk, and there's only so much 
   mileage you can get out of a crappy looking nightclub where people 
   dance like it's still the sixties.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Like 99% of Eurocrime films, it's still not painfully terrible. I 
   don't know how they manage it.</FONT></FONT></P>

    In India, plantation owner Dawson has just not-so-subtly broken up 
   with Indian lover Rosalba Neri, who isn't taking it very well. While 
   pacing around the room wearing her very loud necklace (plot point!) 
   she states that she curses the Dawson house and curses the Dawson 
   family, even though it's rumoured that the family is already cursed, 
   what with the previous Dawson going insane because he thought vines 
   were creeping in his window to strangle him and ending being chained 
   up in the basement. We've all been there.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After a very Jess Franco-like title sequence, we find ourselves 
   slightly in the future, with Dawson returning to the plantation with 
   a new bride - Barbara. Barbara is very happy to be in her new home 
   but Dawson is more like 'where's the fuckin' servants' to his butler 
   Shunda. Shunda says they all left for some reason and soon (not that 
   soon though) we find out why: Rosalba Neri got wind of Dawson's 
   marriage and killed herself by drowning. We get to see her body being 
   burned near the Ganges (and I really hope that isn't Neri's foot we 
   see in that shot, because those toes are gross). The funeral was 
   attended by Shunda and Dawson's creepy son Walter, who was also 
   eavesdropping in on the night Dawson dumped Neri. Oh, and no one saw 
   Neri's face because it was all bloated from being in the water. You 
   know where this is heading. The curse has befallen the household and 
   veteran fans of these films will be wondering whether there's going 
   to be some Scooby Doo shit on the horizon.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dawson starts thinking that Neri is still alive, hearing her 
   necklace rattling, seeing her in reflections, thinking that a tiger 
   in the jungle contains her spirit. His doctor, who treated his 
   father, thinks it's all down to that Dawson madness creeping to the 
   surface. Meanwhile young Walter is putting the moves on his new mum, 
   teaching her how to play pool, showing her his art and staring at her 
   creepily which is a surprisingly effective strategy. He does the same 
   to his neighbour's wife too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It isn't terribly exciting, however, and an awful lot of time is 
   spent talking before Dawson heads out the get that damn tiger. He 
   fixates on it as representing Neri and sets out to kill it 
   eventually, but a severe mauling by the tiger (Neri?) brings in the 
   final act of the film, which actually contains stuff like things 
   happening, notable events, and people moving slightly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At least Larraz keeps it all vague so you're left to make you're own 
   mind up as to what's happened. I think there might have been nudity 
   in there too but not on the copy on YouTube. You know YouTube. R Budd 
   Dwyer blowing his brains out? No problem. Rosalba Neri's arse? Heaven forbid!</FONT></FONT></P>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">It
    turns out that the Mario Merola school of crime movies didn't form 
   in a vacuum, as here we have a film that's high on tragedy and 
   crying, a few characters sing a song or two, there are petty 
   Neapolitan gangsters out on the take, and even pauper children.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I've got to admit though that Merola hasn't quite played a character 
   as dumb as Renato. Renato (Aldo Nicodemi, yet another Italian actor 
   who was killed in a car crash) has given up an honest living for a 
   life of crime because he's head over heels in love with Lydia 
   (Jacqueline Pierreux). Lydia on the other hand is all over the place, 
   because one minute she loves him but then she kind of loves the Mafia 
   boss who has employed Renato. He's alright with Lydia playing away 
   though, that is until Renato botches a jewellery robbery which 
   results in a dead jeweller and an angry mob boss.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Renato copes the best way he can by causing another human's death - 
   he goes home to bed and tells his mother to cover for him when the 
   cops show up. This enrages Renato's brother Mario (Franco Silva from 
   the perv-tastic <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#PatrickStillLives80">PATRICK
    STILL LIVES</A></B>). Mario is an upstanding citizen, working as a 
   guard for what appears to be Italy's version of the merchant navy. 
   Mario is also a widower with a little kid that his mum looks after 
   while he's off on duty. He knows Renato is up to something but can't 
   quite figure it out, but he's going to find out shortly anyway 
   through a stupid coincidence.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now I never picked up the mob boss's name because I'm not sure he 
   even had one, but let's call him Harry as he was played by an actor 
   called Harry Feist, who seems to have appeared in Renato Polselli's <B><A HREF="crime_in_moon_park_1952.htm">CRIME
    IN MOON PARK</A></B> (if anyone could upload that to YouTube, thanks 
   in advance!). The bar Harry operates out of is interesting for two 
   reasons: one is the singer/guitar player who plays songs while in the 
   bar, but also acts as Harry's lookout and spy while out in the city. 
   Sometimes he does both at the same time, turning up at heists belting 
   out a song that's probably about cigarette smuggling or clams and 
   spaghetti. The other is the dancer who appears a few times an does a 
   little dance number to the busker guy's tunes for no real reason 
   other than she's played by pretty real life ballerina Flora 
   Torrigiani. It's probably just as well these songs are in the film 
   (all written by director Rate Furlan) because there's not much plot.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What arises story wise is that Renato has to make up to Harry for 
   messing up the jewellery job by taking part in a big job - that of 
   robbing one of the merchant ships down on the docks. To gain 
   information for the job Harry has Lydia seduce one of the guards who 
   is, that's right, Renato's brother Mario. Bad timing too, because 
   Renato asked Lydia to marry him and she said no, so the dumbass goes 
   and gets drunk off his ass right before the big ship robbery...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film is barely over an hour long so it's not going to be that 
   hard to sit through, and it does contain some action (and songs...so 
   many songs!). There's a couple of shoot-outs towards the end and one 
   character even commits suicide by shooting himself in the head, so 
   the Eurocrime elements are all there, except the rampant nudity and 
   car chases and funky music. Harry is quite a nasty character, even 
   ordering one of his men to beat another one of his goon's girlfriends 
   to death for causing a scene in a bar, so the polizioteschi mean 
   streak is already there.</FONT></FONT></P>

    got to admit that I fell asleep during this one, but whether or not 
   that was down to the film being almost ninety-nine percent dialogue

   one of them spent a couple of days pretending it was dying is

    Insurance claims aren't exactly the most pulse-pounding reasons to 
   make a film, but this is what <B>THE UNKNOWN WOMAN</B> is all about; 
   a guy investigating an insurance claim because it sounds fairly dodgy 
   to him, and the insurance company wants him to dig up some dirt so 
   they don't need to pay. Philippe Leroy is that guy, and the plot 
   jumps back and forth in time as Philippe follows a young girl around 
   Milan and we find out exactly why he's doing that. What's not 
   explained is how she doesn't seem to notice him being about three 
   feet away from her for an entire day.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    An old lady who was in good health has died suddenly, just shortly 
   after cutting her three eldest daughters out of the will. That means 
   that the 300 million insurance pay-out will go to the two youngest 
   siblings - arrogant asshole Orfeo, and rebellious but possibly 
   unstable Cinzia (Paola Pitagora from two gialli I can't find - <B><A HREF="hands_in_the_pocket_1965.htm">HANDS
    IN THE POCKET</A></B> and <B><A HREF="hassled_hooker_1972.htm">THE 
   HASSLED HOOKER</A></B>). Cinzia, however, has disowned the family, so 
   the first third of the film details Phillipe interviewing the rest of 
   them and trying to find Cinzia's whereabouts.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The family are how you would expect rich Italian families to be - 
   aloof, bored, debauched and cynical. Only one sister seems genuinely 
   upset her mother is dead, but others in the family are very 
   suspicious of Philippe, as it the family lawyer and rich husband of 
   one of the sisters (played by Silvano Tranquili). Led by Silvano, the 
   family are going to be contesting the will, which is going to get in 
   Philippe's way further down the line.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When he finally does meet Cinzia, Philippe pretends he's never met 
   her before and merely offers to give her shelter from the rain and a 
   ride to wherever she wants to go. This being the late sixties, that's 
   all the chat-up lines he needs before they both end up in bed 
   together, but the next day he reveals his true intentions and Cinzia 
   rather bloodily tries to kill herself.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Philippe saves her, and soon a romance seems to blossom between the 
   two...or does it? This is a giallo in its most mysterious form - that 
   of the viewer having no clue who is telling the truth, who is being 
   sincere, who is playing the long con, and who knows about all the 
   mind games in the first place. That's what holds your interest 
   throughout (unless you've spent the night listening to a rat 
   breathing and fretting about it), and <A HREF="without_knowing_anything_about_her_1969.htm#OST">Ennio
    Morricone's score</A> helps along the way. That's all the plot 
   you're getting too, so you'll just have to watch it to find out what 
   happens. There are plenty of twists in the last act, even if the film 
   doesn't have much violence in it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Philippe Leroy does a good job here as he's allowed to move around 
   and show some emotion, which makes his character's real motives very

   it out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The real life Renato Vallanzasca's Wikipedia page is rather long but 
   from skimming over it, it looks like the film kind of cherry picks 
   bits of his life but follows its own course. I did pick up that in 
   order to escape from prison, he voluntarily contracted hepatitis by 
   eating rotten eggs, injecting piss into his bloodstream, and inhaling 
   propane gas. That should have definitely been in the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film features Roberto Vallanzasca, moustache-sporting career 
   criminal who when we first meet him is in prison with sidekick Italo, 
   just minding their business and trying not to get bum-raped (they are 
   in prison AND it's a Mario Bianchi film after all) when some 
   political prisoner is transferred to their cell, after we spend a 
   long time with his old cellmates for no good reason. About ten 
   seconds into a conversation where they convince the guy they are not 
   going to kill him, a bunch of other prisoners burst into the room, 
   beat the guy senseless, then hang him from a sheet. When the crooked 
   prison guards enter the cell, Roberto and Italo do a runner and 
   escape prison.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In what turns out to be a pretty episodic first half of a film, 
   Roberto and Italo acquire some clothes then go to a connection who 
   runs a club where the wedding reception is taking place of the 
   daughter of Mafia boss Don Enrico Salerno (the instantly recognisable 
   Enrico Maisto, Fabio Testi's on screen brother in <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Contraband1980">CONTRABAND</A></B>,
    whose filmography seems to be exclusively Eurocrime, including <B><A HREF="blood_brothers_1974.htm">BLOOD

    and <B><A HREF="dont_trust_the_mafia_1979.htm">DON'T TRUST THE MAFIA</A></B>).
    Proving that facial hair isn't quite an indication of high 
   intelligence, Roberto and Italo decide to rob the entire wedding, 
   which results in a gunfight which ends when ANOTHER gang turn up and 
   rescue Roberto and Italo. &quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot; asks 
   Salerno, and indeed, me.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Turns out it's time for some sort of plot to arise, as it seems that 
   high-profile escapee Roberto is fine material to act as kidnapper for 
   some shady organisation. The plan is that Roberto and some other guys 
   kidnap the daughter of some rich oil guy and keep her out of sight 
   while the organisation do the negotiating, with only Roberto and 
   sex-mad Franco Garofalo (from double Oscar winner <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellLivingDead1980">ZOMBIE
    CREEPING FLESH</A></B> and Maurizio Merli-crime drama <B><A HREF="seagulls_fly_low_1978.htm">SEAGULLS

   the young girl (Stefania D'Amario - Richard Johnson's assistant in <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE
    FLESH EATERS</A></B>), and when I saw eyes, I mean he manages to get 
   one of those rolling horrors focussed on her for a few seconds. 
   Luckily, he's got a hooker who turns up for some loving, awarding the 
   audience with a brief glimpse of him naked, and it was like looking 
   at some hairy chopsticks with a zombified early-sixties moptop Beatle 
   staring out above the ribcage of a Manx cat.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's violent but not bloody, meandering but not that boring, cheap

   into porn films. They are better than Alfonso Breschia's Naples-based

   virtually nothing else happens throughout the course of the film save 
   for a proto-supermodel staring out of a window of a car and lapsing 
   into a fantasy world where not even one version of herself can 
   satiate the hungry ego.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Veruschka chases herself through an icy forest, meets herself as a 
   child, burns effigies of herself and sees herself dying in multiple 
   ways. Despite the near absence of a plot, we become aware that the 
   film's intention is to make us witness Veruschka explore her own mind 
   in almost agonising detail, all the while accompanied by Luigi 
   Pistilli's almost lycanthropic scowling countenance. It is a road 
   trip from Hell - one that contains the excitement of a doctor's 
   waiting room, the sexual tension of fairly sparse Post Office, the 
   unbearable anticipation of the delivery of some Chinese food, the 
   kind that may or may not contain too much garlic and therefore give 
   rise to complaints about one's breath in the morning.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The story, for those neophytes that still demand such things from 
   Italian cinema, is concerned with Veruschka making the right choice 
   in leaving her lover Michael in the snowy expanses of some Tuetonic 
   region and hitting the road, as it were, with dishevelled, sardonic manager/lover
    Luigi Pistilli. Upon embarking on such an endeavour, has Veruschka 
   betrayed her own self and turned her back on the true materials of 
   life that make us all happy, like young love, freedom, and rolling 
   about in the snow? To answer these questions Veruschka embarks on 
   flights of fancy, distorted adventures into a dream land where she 
   is, at least superficially, in control.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Faced with her own incessant ticking of her biological clock, 
   Veruschka tries to solve the possibility of never experiencing her 
   maternal instincts by burying a surfeit of dolls on a beach, 
   galvanising dolls with wax and keeping them in a secret room, and 
   staring at a child picking up bits of a broken doll, all subtle 
   symbolism I'm sure you'd agree. She also seeks to escape her 
   relationship with Pistilli, envisioning herself falling from a cliff, 
   running herself over in a car, and just fantasising about Pistilli 
   just shooting her outright. It must be highlighted that although 
   Veruschka is introspected and heavily pursuing some sort of internal 
   isolationism, Pistilli just has a game of soccer with some kids and 
   gives Veruschka a sock to the jaw.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It sounds like I'm being factious with regards to this film, but the 
   seemingly interminable monologues are bolstered by fantastical 
   images, most of which involve physical distortions to model 
   Veruschka's face, being it encased in wax, held within a cage, 
   painted like some exotic creature or replicated by ersatz copies 
   which are then destroyed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The biggest highlight of this film is <A HREF="veruschka_poetry_of_a_woman_1971.htm#OST">Ennio
    Morricone's soundtrack</A>, which flits from lush lounge music to 
   soaring symphonic simplicity before descending into atonal Sun 
   Ra-like cathartic percussion exercises, even sometimes delving into 
   uneasy funky experiments. The fact that the soundtrack as presented 
   is almost an hour and twenty minutes long should be indicative of how 
   little dialogue the film contains, and how much celluloid is given 
   over to surrealism and Morricone's music.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    early film that details how the disaffected teenage boys of Italy 
   act out in various violent ways and blame it on society, starring 
   Franco Citti, who did pretty much the same film in the previous 
   year's <B><A HREF="accattone_1961.htm">ACCATTONE</A></B>. Like that 
   film, this one is also <A HREF="violent_life_1962.htm#PasoliniBook">written

   directed by Paolo Heusch of <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#WerewolfGirlsDorm61">WEREWOLF
    IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY</A></B> fame! And to add to the confusion 
   Brunello Rondi is also listed as director. He directed the absolutely 
   jaw-dropping film <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Demon1963">THE DEMON</A></B>,
    which I recommend more than just about any other film on this page.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Judging by the relentless grim content of <B>A VIOLENT LIFE</B>, I'm 
   going to speculate that Pasolini was like the Morrisey of Italian 
   films. In the film <B>ACCATTONE</B>, Franci Citti's character is so 
   self-centred that he even tricks his own estranged son into thinking 
   he wants a hug when all he really wants is to steal the necklace the 
   boy is wearing. His character in <B>A VIOLENT LIFE</B>, Tommaso, is 
   nearly as bad as that, at least to begin with, but at least is 
   changed, or tries to change because of certain events.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Just like all those other films that have jobless, macho youths 
   hanging around, this one starts with a bunch of jobless, macho youths 
   hanging around. They are all pretty interchangeable, save for Tommaso 
   and a mate of his who does a bit of singing. Tommaso and his mates 
   don't fancy the idea of working, but they do love to go out at night 
   and terrorise people, <B><A HREF="clockwork_orange_1971b.htm">A 
   CLOCKWORK ORANGE</A></B> style. They got out and find a necking 
   couple to beat up and possibly rape (bearing in mind this is nineteen 
   sixty-two, that's kind of glossed over). Then, they rob a gas station 
   but end up with a pittance. Tommaso's life doesn't seem to be going 
   anywhere until he bumps into the innocent Stella, and now he's got to 
   try and act like he's not a complete asshole.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first date involves going to the cinema to watch a <B><A HREF="hercules_1958.htm">HERCULES</A></B> 
   film! Stella's acting all engrossed, but Tommaso wants a little 
   loving and doesn't pick up on any of the subtle hints Stella is 
   giving off that he's not getting any that night. I mean, she was 
   acting like she was interested in an Italian Peplum film for a start 
   man. Nobody does that. Stella doesn't maintain contact however, so 
   Tommaso's brings in his singer friend to serenade her, but there's a 
   problem - his guitar is in the pawn shop and he needs cash. Tommaso 
   knows how to get - he simply robs a young woman in the street and 
   it's job done. Remember - Tommaso - Asshole.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The serenade goes well, although I was wondering why Tommaso brought 
   about ten of his mates with him. Stella switches on her bedroom light 
   and looks out of the window, just before a bunch of other guys turn 
   up and start taking the piss out of Tommaso. He deals with it the 
   only way he knows how - by stabbing the guy to death (You see? 
   Asshole). This gets Tommaso eighteen months in prison for 
   manslaughter, and yet somehow Stella decides to stay by his side.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's just the start of Tommaso and Stella's journey together. 
   Tommaso is all about getting a job and doing right by Stella, but his 
   macho insecurity leads to him giving her a slap when they try to love 
   in the middle of some wasteground (classy!). Will Tommaso ever be 
   able to change in order to finally win over Stella for good? Maybe a 
   bout of TB and a run-in with communists may change his mind, or a 
   biblical level flood.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I sound kind of down on this film but I enjoyed it. Franco Citti's a 
   strange kind of actor. He can show rage well, but other emotions just 
   result in a blank, incredulous star, and I think that's a deliberate 
   move on Citti's part to convey that Tommaso hasn't really got a clue 
   what to do when faced with something that isn't part of his clique of 
   chest thumping macho men. Not to mix confusion with stupidity though, 
   because Tommaso can turn into a viper at the drop of a hat, still 
   wearing the same expression. The cinematography is as dark as the 
   tone of the film itself, and set mostly in some part of Rome that's 
   part ghetto, part apocalyptic landscape. I couldn't help wonder how 
   they did that flood scene in the shanty town. Outstanding set design there.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is probably one of those neo-realist films, isn't it? I don't 
   know much about them, mainly because you have to pay for them and I'm 
   a tight-arsed Scotsman.</FONT></FONT></P>

    kicking Cop Sereni is so ass-kicking he has his own ass kicked off 
   the force for being so ass-kicking. Resting his ass-kicked ass after 
   a busy day, Sereni flashes back to various incidents in his career, 
   where we see that he probably was a bit too quick to kick-ass as he 
   kills about ten bad guys in his flashback alone. After that, we can 
   settle down for a slightly off-beat cop film involving blackmail. And 
   an awful lot of face punching.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sereni is kicked off the force and heads to a hotel out in the 
   country. where he hooks up with a lady who confesses that the hotel 
   isn't the most law-abiding place to be. She used to be part of a 
   blackmail syndicate where chicks would pick up dudes and get it on 
   with them while a bunch of photographers would take pictures through 
   a two way mirror and blackmail the victim. However, the hotel manager 
   gets wind that the ex-cop is hearing things he shouldn't and a 
   mysterious killer is brought in to silence the woman (it's Al Cliver 
   - I don't why it's played out as a mystery at first).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These blackmailers have many allies and are run by suave businessman 
   Richard Harrison and his girl, who also befriends the wives of 
   politicians so she can drug them and film them in compromising 
   positions. The ex-cop has to get a witness who can lead him to the 
   main bad guys, but he has killer Al Cliver to contend with, plus a 
   crooked cop who is out for his blood. These people must think that 
   Sereni is made of fists, as he punches his way through the cast to 
   the head of the organisation.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mario Bianchi never seems to have much of a budget, but his films 
   are different enough and well-paced to be of interest. Focussing more 
   on blackmail rather than armed robbery or kidnap is a good angle, and 
   our cop Sereni (I have no idea who this actor is) uses his violent 
   ruthless side to avenge the deaths of young ladies. Surprisingly, Al 
   Cliver is the strongest actor here as the cold-hearted, business-like 
   assassin, while Richard Harrison...is Richard Harrison.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There's plenty of punch-ups and a bit of gunplay, but the film 
   really just sets up loads of bad guys we hope will meet a bad end.

    It turns out Mario Merola was lying to us all this time! Naples 
   isn't full of singing, loveable gangsters hawking cigarettes to help 
   their sick mamas, nor do the kids there lead happy-go-lucky lives as 
   street urchins, nor even is there screaming fat guys pratfalling and 
   having jolly japes. Not at all. In this real life film, the gangsters 
   are hawking the street urchins to the fat guys for bum sex, then 
   filling them full of drugs.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first scene sets the tone of the entire film. Young Vito has 
   just witnessed his father murder his sister and his mother, but 
   luckily Vito manages to talk his father out of killing him. With his 
   father in jail, Vito goes off to live with his uncle and aunt which 
   should be a new start in life, but then it turns out the uncle is 
   sexually abusing Vito's cousin and his aunt is doing a bit of 
   streetwalking on the side to support her deadbeat husband. Not 
   surprisingly, Vito sets off on a path of crime, along with his friend 
   Gaetano (whose mother sends him out every day to get money to 'pay' 
   her for being his mother), and some other kids.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Vito's every day life consists of being bored in school, robbing his 
   twelve-year-old prostitute friend's customers, trying to extort money 
   from street vendors by pissing on their tomatoes, bag snatching, 
   playing videos games, poncing ciggies from strangers, getting slapped 
   around by his uncle, hawking jewellery, and withdrawing further and 
   further from reality by watching television at every oppurtunity. 
   You'd think going to jail would be a relief for our young hero, 
   except for, you know, all the raping and stuff.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This grim film is ultra-realistic in places while teetering on the 
   brink of arthouse too, presenting Vito's life as a chaotic, 
   fragmented mess where his horrific life is intercut with his friends 
   experiencing equally horrific situations, like suicide, isolation and 
   bullying, while everyone withdraws into the world of video games and 
   television. In one clever move, director Capuano has us, the viewers, 
   stare at the TV while in the background we can cleary hear Vito 
   getting a beating from his nasty uncle.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The worst part of it all is that when things get increasingly worse 
   for the kids, the less the kids react to what's happening, becoming 
   emotionless shells who would rather watch the end credits of some 
   bland television programme than face reality. Even the young child 
   prostitute blankly accepts an armful of heroin from her pimp, before 
   moving on to blankly injecting it herself and offering it to Vito. I 
   guess Capuano wanted to highlight that this stuff goes on everywhere 
   everyday, and does a pretty good job of conveying that message. Man, 
   it totally sucks to be a kid in Naples.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The pizza's pretty good there though, so I guess they can't complain

   vanishing into thin air.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    You see, Mickey was hired by rich landowner Don Alonso to figure out 
   what was causing a mysterious run of deaths on his ranch. Mickey 
   instead fell in love with Don Alonso's daughter Pilar and the next 
   thing you know, he's finding strange totems in his room and doing a

    Ringo gets hired by some enemy of Don Alonso but on the way to the

   ranch to find his brother still gone, Pilar now single and giving him 
   the eye, and many people either having fits and dying or dying in the

   is the killer and where are they getting those little totems from?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ridiculously cheap in every aspect, from the sets, the acting, the 
   editing, the script and the music, the film still delivers in the 
   mystery stakes as Ringo and the sheriff run around the place trying 
   to get clues from the rapidly diminishing pool of witnesses and 
   accomplices. There's no skimping on the body count either, as the 
   killer cuts a swathe through the cast and Ringo guns down a shitload 
   of hired guns working for the killer.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    In what turned out to be the only enjoyable part of the film, all 
   the defenders of Earth have a big party and some astronauts even 
   venture outside to use their bodies to spell out &quot;Happy New 
   Year&quot; with their bodies. Anyone familiar with Margheriti's work 
   knows that this means he gets to break out the old models, which is 
   still more realistic than the actors who have to actually pretend to 
   space walk, which in this film means being swung around on a hook. It 
   was pretty funny when one guy has to pretend he was spacewalking 
   while firmament-drunk.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things start getting boring when this green smoke starts turning up 
   on Margheriti's model sets and various crews try to fight it, which 
   leads to various actors trying to shoot smoke with their '.38s' and 
   then turning to stone (kind of). Most people the smoke attacks end up 
   in some kind of suspended animation, and there was some sort of 
   explanation for this, but by the time they got around to it, I was 
   almost comatose from how boring the film was and for all I know I was 
   having some sort of space-hallucination.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I haven't enough life span left to track down all of Antonio 
   Margheriti's sci-fi films (although I get the feeling I'm going to 
   regret saying that), but this is astro-marginally better than <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#AssignmentOS1960">ASSIGNMENT:

    OF THE WORLDS</A></B>. It's still not good though, which is why I 
   haven't mentioned anything about the actors or even characters. 
   Franco Nero is in it, but he and various other actors all look the 
   same, so it's hard to keep track with what's going on. I think there 
   was a bit about food appearing in strange things that dropped from 
   the ceiling and a bunch of dead spacemen at the bottom of a bin, but 
   who knows. You see, this is how you review a film - by hazily 
   recalling things you might have seen in the film, then trying to make 
   lame jokes based around cosmological phrases.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's December 1999 and the Martians have landed on Earth, but not in 
   a violent, killing sort of way. Via a rather rubbish reverse shot of 
   a rocket taking off, the public's most trusted news reporter, Iron 
   Idem, informs everyone that the Martians have much to offer mankind, 
   as long as we help them out, too. That's when things start changing 
   for the population and for Idem, as the first change involves him 
   having to read out a prepared script when he prefers to read his own. 
   The next changes are much, much worse. And rather familiar.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The government informs the populace that they now have to stay at 
   home, unless they agree to give a sample of blood to the Martians, 
   and to do that they need to take a friendliness test that gets them a 
   Life Pass in order for them to walk outside to go to the resource 
   centre to give blood in the first place. These rules are enforced not 
   by the Martians themselves (who appear to be small fat guys painted 
   silver and wearing bubble jackets) but by human officials, be it 
   stuck-up office jobsworths or the brutal guards who patrol the streets.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Idem is enraged at the script being written for him, and someone 
   higher up seems to have noticed, because that night the guards and a 
   couple of Martians burst into his home, kidnap his wife, destroy all 
   his property and turf him out into the street. He still gets to keep 
   his job though, working for a <A HREF="war_of_the_worlds_next_century_1981.htm#RealityWeCreateIt">TV
    company whose slogan is 'Reality: We Create It'</A>, as the public 
   love him and believe what he says. They also seem to believe that the 
   terrible wig he wears during broadcasts is real, despite it looking 
   awful. People always act surprised to find he's bald in real life.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Idem's priority now is to find his wife, and to do that he's going 
   to have to conform to many of these new government regulations, 
   including taking a friendliness test to prove he's friendly to the 
   Martians, which involve <A HREF="war_of_the_worlds_next_century_1981.htm#EarTag">his
    ear getting tagged</A> like a dairy cow, <A HREF="war_of_the_worlds_next_century_1981.htm#BloodDonorStation">giving
    blood at a resource centre</A>, and spouting all the bollocks his 
   new masters have him speak to the public. Every journey to the studio 
   becomes an increasingly horrible nightmare as the guards brutalise 
   the public, and he's still not getting any nearer finding out where 
   his wife is...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Now I know this film is a commentary about life in the Soviet Bloc, 
   but you can certainly apply this to life so far in the 2020s. I'm no 
   conspiracy nut and it would take the collusion of thousands of people 
   from hundreds of countries to pretend there's a fake disease out 
   there killing folk, but it's not too far a stretch to consider that 
   those in charge may have seen this crisis as an chance to bring in a 
   little more control over people, is it? I'm not saying that's the 
   reality of the situation, but how many people have you spoken to who 
   have said 'something's not right'? There are several hints throughout 
   the film that there might not even be a Martian visitation at all 
   (which would explain the lazy reverse shot of a rocket taking off). 
   My favourite one is near the end of the film, where Idem has had 
   enough of all the bullshit and is <A HREF="war_of_the_worlds_next_century_1981.htm#MartianPhoto">standing
    in a public toilet when a Martian walks in</A>. Idem smashes it over 
   the head with an iron bar and it collapses into a urinal. Approaching 
   it, Idem asks &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; to which it 
   replies, with its brains hanging out of its head &quot;We were 
   promised candy.&quot; Did Idem kill a kid?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film is also about how readily mankind is to conform to anything 
   as long as they themselves can live an easy life, and how easily 
   people would dismiss the truth in order to believe a more comfortable 
   lie, as Idem outlines in a speech: &quot;You assimilate only what 
   affirms you in the conviction that passivity is virtue and necessity, 
   because it is precisely what you want to believe&quot;. I've got to 
   say at this point that actor Roman Wihelmi is brilliant here. Looking 
   like a cross between Martin Balsam and Tommy Lee Jones, he plays the 
   part very subdued, but with a lot of turmoil going on inside.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Luigi Pistilli keeps getting letters telling him he's a dead man, 
   and it's making him a bit paranoid. Nevertheless, one morning he says 
   goodbye to his wife, then his lover, and sets off with his friend to 
   go hunting, only to find himself the prey. Two corpses later, we've 
   got a big Sicilian funeral to go to while the police chat about the 
   people attending, including a well-respected lawyer (Gabriele 
   Ferzetti) whose cousin (Irene Papas) was married to one of the 
   victims, and Gian Maria Volonte, a professor friend of the two who 
   starts poking in places that should not be poked.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Pistilli is generally thought to be the target as he was a bit of a 
   fanny rat and some family members are arrested, but they are all 
   illiterate so how could they cobble together those threatening 
   letters? Volonte also finds that the words in the letter were from a 
   Vatican-based newspaper, which leads him to the priesthood. Oh, and a 
   lot of people are related in this film, so one of the priests is the 
   uncle of Papas and Ferzetti.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's a formula you'll see a lot of in these films, so it's just as 
   well the lead actors are good! Volonte has the hots for the widow 
   Papas and has to basically restrain himself every times he meets her, 
   while Papas kind of has the hots for him too, leading to all kinds of 
   awkward moments. Volonte is very good at the bookish professor who is 
   just too smart and curious for his own good, while Papas just 
   smoulders as the widow.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   hacking up a few goons with a chainsaw (something that was missing

   radioactive and burns the skin off of anyone who touches it (I don't

    CHRIST SUPERSTAR</A></B>, tries to mix it with the usual Italian 
   comedy, has a Jesus in it who just kind of wanders about, judging 
   people, and yet provides so many awesome and unintentionally funny 
   moments that in my melted brain constitutes some sort of classic. If 
   you don't use the word 'classic' in the way it's supposed to be used.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Be warned though - I've yet to find a copy of this film with 
   subtitles, even auto-translate titles, so the film's dialogue has had 
   to be interpreted by my basic, clunky grasp of Italian. Not that the 
   film is big on plot to be honest. It's more like a series of scenes 
   strung together before another kick-ass disco tune starts up.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jesus, who seems to live on the set of <B><A HREF="fame_1980.htm">FAME</A></B>,
    gets fed up one day and decides to come to Earth. This he does by 
   changing into a white costume and walking into some smoke, which 
   leads to him walking out of the sea in Italy. Immediately he finds 
   himself stopping two Mafiosi trying to extort money from office 
   worker Stella Caracina. This he does by reminding the criminals that 
   Hell and the Devil awaits. The gangsters scarper, and Stella 
   instantly falls in love with Jesus, who leaves her just long enough 
   for her to sing the song &quot;Unisex&quot;, which may be about 
   Stella renouncing modern technology and working life to go off and 
   follow Jesus, but using my command of Italian seems to be about a her 
   desire to piss out of a window of a moving car in front of some nuns.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jesus in the meantime has bumped into the Devil and his entourage of 
   dozens of dancers. The Devil shows Jesus the life of hedonism in a 
   remarkably funky sequence (where, hilariously, Jesus guilt trips two 
   gay men having a snog to the point that one of them walks away!). 
   Meanwhile, the gangsters and various other corrupt members of society 
   meet up to discuss how to fleece people of more money (I think), and 
   also serve to introduce crappy slapstick that kind of disrupts all 
   the awesome music.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Stella isn't taking no for an answer from Jesus and even picks him 
   up hitchhiking while dressed as a man, but Jesus gives her the slip. 
   Jesus is having a kind of crisis of conscience at this point as he's 
   supposed to be all virtuous and pure, and engages in a debate with 
   God, where I'm pretty sure God gives him the go ahead to give Stella 
   one! Get in there my son! I'm guessing God's going to be kind of 
   tuning in there when Jesus does the business. I know I would. This 
   also prompts another song from our divine duo which by my translation 
   is about whether or not it is morally wrong to kidnap a bison and 
   stuff loads of contraband up its arse in order to smuggle booze into Slovenia.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I've got to admit that the Jesus action is kind of broken up in a 
   bad way by the crime syndicate, as if they've been allocated the 
   crappest songs of the film. So does the policeman and whatever he's 
   up to, but then again Jesus gets to call on his Dad's wrath when two 
   guys on a moped steal his scarf. He also somehow makes shoplifting 
   okay for people and gets involved with some hippies. It's around this 
   time the songs kind of dry up until Jesus comes up against heroin, 
   and the Devil!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When a guy overdoses in Jesus' arms and dies, he's got to go and 
   find out what injecting skag is all about, which leads to another 
   highlight - when Jesus meets the Devil in a cave full of junkies and 
   we get a choreographed sequence where a thin dancing girl with spiky 
   hair randomly changes into a giant syringe that the Devil then points 
   at while smiling. AH! I get it - he's trying to tempt Jesus with some 
   quality smack! Maybe Jesus could have tried some and then got his Dad 
   to miracle that monkey off his back. Also, this entire sequence seems 
   to happen in Christ's mind while he's holding a dead junky. It 
   happens to us all at one time or another.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I've also got to admit that the bit where Jesus stops two 
   machine-gun toting nuns from dynamiting a TV mast went right over my 
   head, but that just sets Jesus up with two extra female followers so 
   we get another of my favourite songs, which may be called 'Jesus'. 
   Now, in my work we get a lot of European students that come over to 
   Scotland to witness how horrible it is here so they can appreciate 
   the country they live in a little more (usually from Austria, Spain, 
   or Italy) and one Italian girl was game enough to watch this 
   particular song and try and translate it for me. Sadly, her 
   translation was that the song was about the three girls going on 
   about how Jesus was great and sweet, but I think she might have just 
   been saying that in order for me to stop playing the film, because by 
   my translation of the song is about the three girls begging Jesus to 
   funnel feed them ice cream and cake until they all grow enormously 
   fat in order that they can smother him to death with their collective 
   gigantic arses in some sort of obesity-fuelled suicide pact.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eventually we get to my favourite song in the film, &quot;Come 
   Navigante&quot;, which was released as a single by the guy who plays 
   Jesus (Awana Gana Agawanaganawanawagana Gananawanaganawa). There's 
   even a promotional video for this song, and the b-side is another 
   song from the film. I truly love this song, that plays out while 
   Jesus leads his followers down into the town square. With it's 
   strangely uplifting, gorgeous chorus, this song may be about how 
   faith effects the human condition, but by my translation seems to be 
   about Jesus inviting everyone he meets to go to the town centre so 
   they can witness him buggering a frozen chicken back to life. Also, 
   the song he sings when he gets to the square isn't so good.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's around this point that the film decides to include some plot 
   when the accident-prone cop arrests everybody including Jesus (I 
   think), due to a female Judas selling him out (once again, I think). 
   We do get another song here sung by Stella, who laments losing Jesus 
   forever, maybe, but by my translation the song seems to be about her 
   not being able to decide what her favourite King Crimson album is. It 
   all gets rather confusing by this point as it seems that rather than 
   be in jail, Jesus would rather teleport back to heaven or something. 
   I have no idea, to be honest. All the characters in the film appear 
   in some sort of cattle grid shaped like a crucifix while an 
   instrumental version of Come Navigante play out before some sort of 
   storm happens.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I've reviewed this film once before for the IMDB, and in that review 
   I noted that I was very aware that I was the only person on Earth 
   that was watching <B>WHITE POP JESUS</B>, and by extension, that 
   meant that I was the only person in the universe watching <B>WHITE

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">The
    catchphrase 'that escalated quickly' is everywhere now, but it is 
   really relevant to this film, where lovers Romy Schneider and 
   Gabrielle Tinti go from having an argument to straight up insults to 
   domestic violence to Romy trying to blow Tinti's head off - within 
   the first thirty seconds of the film. It if weren't for the credits 
   having to play out I bet Tinti wouldn't have hesitated before driving 
   his car off that cliff. But he does, so the credits can be all French 
   and stuff, this being a French take on the old school giallo plot.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Tinti does take things to the extreme by diving off the cliff, but 
   Romy Schneider manages to jump out of the car before it goes over. A 
   passer-by calls the law, and it's quickly discovered that Tinti's 
   body is nowhere to be seen, having been possibly taken away by the 
   tide or maybe lifted into the air by some really strong seagulls. 
   Romy doesn't seem terribly put out about it mind you, and somehow is 
   able to just get the police to stop asking her so many annoying questions.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One guy who will spend most of the entire film asking annoying 
   questions is Tinti's brother Maurice Ronet. He wasn't terribly close 
   to his brother but feels the need to find out what's going on. He 
   meets up with Romy and notes the way she doesn't seem that arsed 
   about Tinti's death (I thought she was just 'being French'). Romy 
   changes her tune slightly when Maurice tries to drop her off at her 
   apartment and she sees something which disturbs her at her front 
   door, so instead she asks to stay at Maurice's house for a while.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Romy is a bit damaged by the relationship with Tinti, who was known 
   to be a bit of a bastard, but she pretends to Maurice that they were 
   in love. Maurice, on the other hand, is convinced that Romy killed 
   Tinti, but when he presses her on the subject, she seduces him. I 
   didn't think it was appropriate for Maurice to ask Romy if she'd 
   killed his brother right in the middle of doing the nasty. but maybe 
   that's the way he got his kicks. This takes place about two days 
   after his brother's death, too.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The basic plot is this - Maurice is convinced that Romy has killed 
   his brother somehow and tries to unveil the truth by tracking their 
   last movements next to the cliff and trying to get the truth out of 
   Romy, who insists she's telling the truth while at the same time 
   convinced that Tinti (from so many Laura Gesmer films and the 
   lightweight, fun <B><A HREF="mystere_1983.htm">MYSTERE</A></B>) is 
   still alive and haunting her, like when she's in a very fancy 
   shopping mall and sees Tinti everywhere. To be honest, there's a lot 
   more Maurice asking her about his brother's death and a lot less 
   possible haunting than you'd expect in this one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's not bad though - stylish, well composed, and you can almost 
   smell those gauloises cigarettes through the screen. Things did not 
   end well for Romy Schneider in real life.</FONT></FONT></P>

    I'm a bit rusty on Germaine Greer's &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot;, 
   but I'm sure the whole point of the book was to highlight that every 
   female's desire was to marry a guy and then financially support him 
   by becoming a prostitute. This is what happens to Paola in this film. 
   Her husband is a failing art dealer working in a gallery strangely 
   similar to that of the gallery in <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BirdCrystalPlum1970">THE
    BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE</A></B>, and when Paola's assistant 
   suddenly reveals that she runs a discreet little boudoir where Paola 
   can make some cash servicing men, Paola reluctantly signs up for it. 
   To make things even weirder, this conversation happens in a room full 
   of mannequins, where every time the scene cuts from her pimp to

    non-Italian countries, and probably Italy itself now that I think 
   about, Alberto Sordi is the second most likely actor you'll see in a 
   framed picture on a wall in a restaurant, comically eating some 
   spaghetti. I pass a place in Glasgow city centre on occasion while 
   going to work (as I change my route often to avoid bandits and 
   Italian film fan groupies), and this restaurant has a window display 
   of Sordi tucking into a pile of pasta. It also has at least three 
   pictures of actor Toto doing the same thing, which is why Toto is the 
   number one actor you'll see in a framed picture in (paragraph 
   continues in this fashion for some time).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    What I'm getting at in a really terrible way is that although I'm 
   aware of Alberto Sordi, I've never watched one of his films until 
   now. I've covered other comic actors like Ugo Tognazzi, Nino 
   Manfredi, and Jerry Cala, so I should probably throw an Alberto Sordi 
   one in there too. There's probably a Bombolo film or two to be 
   covered since he's in those <A HREF="#HitSquad1976">Tomas</A> <A HREF="swindle_1977.htm">Milian</A> <A HREF="little_italy_1978.htm">cop</A> <A HREF="#AssassinOnTiber1979">films</A>,
    and I'm struggling through my first Pippo Franco film, but don't 
   hold out for a Toto one because I can't stand him. Don't tell the

    Turns out I picked a good one, because the comedy in this film is 
   mixed with bit of melancholy, a bit of fantasy, and a whole load of 
   social commentary. Alberto Sordi also seems very good at injecting 
   his characters with a lot of humanity. which means we get to witness 
   his character go through a lot of mixed emotions on his travels. In 
   the beginning, he's an arrogant, hard-working publisher who is always 
   in high gear, and at first he's not that interested when his 
   sister-in-law pleads for him to track down his brother-in-law Nino

    Sordi turns up in Africa in full safari gear, filming the locals, 
   only to find that he's the weird one and one of the locals is filming 
   him with a much more expensive camera. Instead, he's soon won over by 
   the majesty of the African plains (while Blier doesn't seem that 
   interested at all) and is enjoying the scenery when his white driver 
   shoots an antelope for no reason. Shortly after, Sordi meets a 
   tribesman and is overjoyed, saying that they are brothers. However, 
   he discovers that not every white person has that attitude, starting 
   with the driver, who soon finds himself fired.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What we have here is a comedy version of Joseph Conrad's Heart of 
   Darkness (which I've never read - is Marlon Brando in the book too?). 
   I know this because Sordi specifically mentions reading the book 
   while travelling through Africa, where our duo meet a Portugese 
   conman, a bunch of priests who collect butterflies, a ghostly woman 
   (Erika Blanc) who can seemingly teleport around the place, and a 
   bunch of mercenaries while following clues that may or may not lead 
   to Manfredi. They also meet some deeply racist German folk and end up 
   bonding together over a punch-up.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sordi's slightly manic and melancholic character carries the film, 
   but Bernard Blier's understated performance as his long-suffering 
   sidekick is a brilliant contrast. Add to this immaculate Italian 
   cinematography and a <A HREF="will_our_heroes_be_able_to_find_their_friend_who_has_mysteriously_disappeared_in_africa_1968.htm#OST">lush
    soundtrack</A>, and you've got a pretty enjoyable film that's 
   actually funny in places, emotional in others. It is also over two 
   hours long, which is rather long for a comedy.</FONT></FONT></P>

    guess when you're trying to showcase gore the plot's going to take a 
   backseat, but in this film director Antoine Pellissier takes things 
   too far, offering a seemingly endless gorefest with so little plot 
   even those who did only basic French in high school will have no 
   trouble translating the French script into &quot;Where are you?&quot;,
    &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Don't leave me.&quot; The rest of the

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B>WITCHCRAFT</B> does start out like it's heading towards Gothic 
   horror territory, set somewhere back in the nineteenth century. A 
   family made up (I think), middle-aged mother and father, two sisters, 
   a brother and a much younger brother, are all travelling by coach to 
   their new digs - a large castle they've inherited from an uncle who 
   died of a weird disease. They don't quite make it there though as the 
   horses get spooked and a nearby satanic ritual causes the undead to 
   rise, kill their driver, and chase them all in to the woods where 
   they all get split and get murdered one by one, hence the 
   name-shouting and 'where are you?' stuff.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And that's it, save for the last half hour when those that have died 
   come back from the dead to take part in another ritual. There's a 
   stupid plot twist at the end for the good measure but that's the film 
   plot-wise. No character development, nothing. Just some names and screaming.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, if you come to this film looking for gore there's plenty of 
   that, as throats are slit, eyes are gouged out, faces peeled off, 
   guts ripped out and eaten, heads smashed in, arms and legs cut-off, 
   you know the drill. It's just that, without any meat to the film, 
   this all becomes tiresome very quickly. What else is there to say?</FONT></FONT></P>

    <B>WITCHHAMMER</B> gives us a snapshot of the shadow of holy terror 
   hanging over everyone in 17th Century Moravia, all because an old 
   lady tried to steal an Eucharist from a mass to give to a lady who is 
   having trouble conceiving. The priest, alarmed that some witches 
   might be in league with the Devil and actually having some fun, 
   alerts the local gentry, who bring in an Inquisitor, Boblig, the 
   Squire of Edelstadt, to weed out the witches and rid the slightly 
   concerned and certainly gullible rich people of the Devil.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Almost right away we can see that Boblig enjoys his job too much. He 
   starts with the old lady, using his minions to torture her and force 
   her to make up some bullshit about cavorting on Peter's Rock with the 
   Devil, who then sticks a little candle up her arse and uses her as a 
   lamp. Next up are the women she named, who are then also tortured and 
   forced to confess, although when one particularly defiant woman names 
   Boblig as the Devil, he has his men break her neck. Of course, after 
   a hard day's accusing folk of getting drunk, gorging themselves and 
   cavorting, Boblig gets wasted on wine paid for by the state, gorges 
   on fancy food, and lusts after one lady in particular.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This lady is Sussanah, and she is the orphan cook of the Dean 
   Lautner, a pious man. Dean and Sussanah love each other, but they 
   have vowed not to let things get physical. Boblig and his sycophantic 
   crony spot her right away, but focus on taking down everyone around 
   the Dean first, while various member of the establishment begin to 
   regret bringing a madman like Boblig in on things, but also while 
   being to scared to stand up to him, lest they best tied to a stake 
   and burned.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Only the Dean can stand up to him, but how many thumbscrews and 
   racks can a person take before they give up and give in? This grim 
   film pulls no punches as it shows how futile a situation can be when 
   someone goes mad with power and remains unchallenged. It might also 
   be an allegory for communism, but I was too involved in the plot to 
   go looking for symbolism. Vladimir Smeral, who plays Boblig, is 
   simply brilliant as the cynical, hedonistic inquisitor who can 
   perform any kind of mental gymnastics to get what he wants, which is 
   usually someone being burned at the stake while he acquires their 
   assets and shares them with the rich folks.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Party member who was their man in the police force has just been

    Undaunted, the Commies choose another guy to take his place - giant

   down the criminals lording it over everybody. However, he's not so 
   sure about his new partner Patuela, a man he recognises as an old 
   political enemy who tortured him when he was a young revolutionary. 
   However, when the robbers attack a jewellers en masse and escape

    Turns out Roman's new partner is Miclovan (Sergiu Nicolaescu), and

   maverick who wants to destroy the crime syndicate right up to the 
   kingpin Semaca, who is in turn becoming the head of some sort of 
   super-gang, but is Miclovan for real? He's very trigger happy and

   To be honest you end up rooting more for him than Roman.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This very well-made film really recreates the post-war atmosphere in 
   Eastern Europe, with the Communists gaining power as the cold war 
   gains momentum. Reading the comments on the IMDb, it seems that the 
   film was made to show the Communists in a good light but director 
   Nicolaescu undercuts this in ways I don't understand because I've 
   never been to Romania, nor do I know anything about it's history 
   other than they popped a cap in their president's ass live on the 
   television when Communism collapsed in Europe, seemingly for a laugh. 
   What I do know is that guns go bang and shit blows up rather a lot, 
   plus we get a warehouse shoot-out at the end, so I'm happy. <A HREF="with_clean_hands_1972.htm#OST">Jazz

   has had to travel back to her home country of Italy as she's just 
   inherited a huge villa from a distant relative. Dalila is kind of 
   messed up. On the way there, she fantasises about the taxi driver 
   stopping the cab and trying to rape her (better work on that 
   imaginary soundtrack Dalila, as that up-beat disco music you've been 
   conjuring kind of jars with the horrible imagined rape scenes), so we 
   know that Dalila isn't quite operating on a fully functioning system.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the town of Orvieto, she meets notary John Saxon, who is there to 
   do the paperwork to sign over the deeds of Dalila's aunt's house. He 
   explains that Dalila's Aunt was a recluse, never leaving the villa, 
   never seeing anyone, just living inside the villa without much 
   contact with the outside world. Saxon makes the mistake of making a 
   comment about how he's surprised that Dalila is a stockbroker, as 
   women are better at spending money than managing it, and this gets 
   Dalila's back up a bit. However, it doesn't stop her lapsing into a 
   fantasy involving all the men staring at her in a local cafe.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things go from the seemingly normal to the weird when Saxon and 
   Dalila investigate the Aunt's house. Every window is boarded up and 
   there's no telephone, two issues that immediately come to light when 
   the front door blows shut, locking the two in the household with no 
   means to escape. Saxon does what I would do - locate the food and the 
   booze and settle down for a session, but Dalila instead has 
   flashbacks to being sexually assaulted in the villa as a kid, but as 
   the film shows, we have no idea if anything Dalila experiences is 
   reality or fantasy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Saxon gets wasted and insists that they both tell each other things 
   that they wouldn't like others to know, like how Saxon has a hot, 
   sexy wife that get it on with him or how he has a son who lives free 
   like a stinking horrible hippy, then tries to get it on with Dalila. 
   She retreats to her room, and finds some pornographic pictures to 
   drool over. At this point, Saxon bursts in and ties up Dalila, 
   producing a gun and shooting her gorily in the wrists...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But that turns out the be another fantasy, as the whole film lapses 
   into a grey area where no one can be sure that what's happening on 
   screen is some kind of fantasy of Dalila or not. We never do find out 
   what is true and what is not (and it may be some kind of inescapable 
   nightmare of some sort), but we do get some sort of study into 
   relationships, as the couple trapped in the villa go from hate to 
   lust to tolerance to love, all while struggling to communicate with 
   the outside world.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While not exactly rip-roaring, I found this one went down easy due 
   to the acting of the two leads, and I don't recall John Saxon given 
   as much space to act out as he does in this film, as he goes from 
   informal to drunk and lecherous to regretful and angry to love-struck 
   to resentful husband. He's pretty impressive here. Plus, when he 
   falls over, his hair didn't move, but that's a subject for another day.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    SIGNED IN WHITE</A></B>, this film packs in a remarkable amount of 
   stuff, like Manera just wanted to include everything you get in a 
   Eurocrime film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's all done on the cheap mind you, and one-man film industry 
   Manera isn't exactly the best director or actor, but I find his films 
   pretty entertaining. Here he plays Antonio, son of Don Vincenzo, 
   played by French actor Michel Constantin in 'old man' make-up, and 
   this seems only be done so Manera can include a five-minute flashback 
   later in the film. Don Vincenzo is dying and wants to leave New York 
   to go back to Abruzzo and die in peace, which is a bit of an ask 
   seeing he's a Mafia Don. The main problem, at least at the start of 
   the film, is that black gangster Fred Williamson wants to take over 
   Vincenzo's turf.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fred is all sass and cigars as usual, and I tip my hat to him 
   multi-tasking by holding a business meeting and getting a blowjob at 
   the same time, but don't get too attached to him as the action 
   switches from New York to Abruzzo. Then Palermo. Then Calabria, and 
   then Marseilles, then New York again and I think Lisbon then 
   somewhere in Italy. Basically, Don Vincenzo can't get any peace as 
   another Godfather has turned on him and he passes his powers on to 
   Antonio (in a scene that literally looks like he's passing on psychic 
   powers to Antonio). Manera also throws in a kind of Romeo and Juliet 
   plot as one of Antonio's brothers gets involved with the daughter of 
   the bad Godfather guy, and she may or may not be some kind of 
   Dracula-like reincarnation of a girl Don Vincenzo fell in love with 
   years ago.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Basically this film is all over the place, but it sure isn't boring, 
   as the body count goes through the roof and Don Antonio seems 
   especially keen to kill just about everyone he comes across. In fact, 
   the film moves so quickly and jumps around so much it&#146;s hard 
   keeping tabs on who works for who or even where anyone is supposed to 
   be at any given time. The randomness factor is quite high too, from a 
   transvestite hooker who changes his voice mid-sentence to utter this 
   line: &quot;They found them with Camels stuck in their mouth, and 
   stuck in their asses too!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">This
    film is both fantasy and complete reality at the same time. Gian 
   Maria Volonte plays an extremely efficient worker doing piecework in 
   a factory, not even sure what the parts he produces are used for. At 
   the same time, Volonte's precise rhythm and total concentration make 
   him an object of hate among his fellow workers, all of whom are 
   continually time-managed by snidey supervisors who mostly hide behind 
   a yellow screen in an observation box. A large hand, <A HREF="working_class_go_to_heaven_1971.htm#OppressiveHandPhoto">index
    finger pointing down oppressively</A>, is printed on the wall above 
   the workers.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Volonte is a good worker but not good at anything else. His son 
   lives with his ex-wife and fellow worker. He can't get it up for his 
   girlfriend, and her little boy spends his time totally consumed by 
   television. Exhausted from working all day, Volonte's only break from 
   routine is to visit a old colleague who has ended up in an asylum. 
   Soon enough, Volonte begins to think that what this man is saying is 
   making sense...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Outside the factory, radical communists screams slogans through 
   megaphones and clash with the unions as the workers trudge in to 
   start their shift. Volonte gets to work right away, but his fellow 
   workers are grinding him down, and a lapse in concentration means 
   that Volonte loses a finger and his whole world outlook changes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Be warned, this film has so many scenes of people screaming into 
   microphones, or crowds of people screaming at each other, that if 
   you're not careful you'll end up with a headache. I'm guessing that 
   might be part of intention of the film to a certain extent. With the 
   loss of the finger Volonte loses his urge to be the best worker and 
   starts to see how his life in the factory may not be a life at all, 
   but all those folk screaming about smashing the system or how unity 
   can get better rights, are they any less self-serving than those in 
   charge at the factory?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Petri does everything he can to make the factory look like some sort 
   of prison, continually filming through bars and even doing the same 
   thing later with a school. <A HREF="working_class_go_to_heaven_1971.htm#MorriconeOST">Ennio
    Morricone's soundtrack</A> also enforces the idea of some kind of 
   industrial trap where the self is wiped away in place of production. 
   The film is run down and grey on purpose, but there are a few bits of 
   Petri's weird visuals here and there - like the strange diagram 
   Volonte faces while getting psychologically tested.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The main reason for watching this is for Gian Maria Volonte, who 
   comes across as a guy who isn't that smart, a man who makes an arse 
   of everything and in losing the only thing he was good at starts 
   unravelling. In the Italian language version you can hear how fragile 
   and hysterical Volonte sounds. He seems to mess up just about every 
   conversation and even when he thinks he's made the wrong choice, it 
   dawns on him that he's not the only one that's shallow.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    the classier Italian films have their many down-points, like not 
   featuring people having their brains pulled out the back of their 
   heads, not featuring modified dune buggies battling it out in a 
   quarry, and not featuring Massimo Vanni, we mustn't neglect them. 
   Case in point is <B>YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW</B>, which I'm 
   reviewing for nostalgic purposes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I first watched this film on Italian television while on holiday 
   some time ago and was taken in by the anthology aspect of it and the 
   acting talents of both Sofia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, who in 
   all three stories included play a couple of varying closeness and 
   class. The comedy in the film isn't forced or overly silly either, 
   like some other comedies produced by Italy. It's more of a snapshot 
   of the sixties and a much different world.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first story we get is set in Naples where Sofia Loren is 
   illegally selling cigarettes on the streets (the act of hooky ciggy 
   selling is covered well in at least a dozen Mario Merola films), and 
   Sofia has gotten herself into a lot of trouble. She's been fined for 
   punting knock-off smokes and refused to pay the fine. She's also 
   managed to side-step the seizing of her furniture by bailiffs through 
   hiding it with her neighbours. This results in a warrant being issued 
   for her arrest. A passing lawyer comments to Sofia's husband, 
   Marcello Mastroianni, that Sofia is going to get jailed, until he 
   realises that Sofia is several months into what I call &quot;Irish 
   Toothache&quot;, and there's no way the police can arrest a pregnant 
   woman and must allow six months after birth for her to nurse the 
   child. Sofia's plan - getting dropping babies - avoid the barry hole!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, there's a slight flaw in the plan. Sofia and Marcello 
   already have three kids, and by the time they get to having seven 
   kids, Marcello is a burned out husk who can't get a moments peace 
   because the family share a one bedroom flat (Naples being extremely 
   densely populated) and he has to look after the kids while Sofia's 
   out selling boosted snouts. Mastroianni performs this beautifully by 
   the way - pale, dishevelled, almost insane with exhaustion. 
   Inevitably, this leads to Marcello not being able to get up and angry 
   to produce more kids. Sofia gets desperate, but is she desperate 
   enough to let another man perform 'last hot dog in the tin' as surely 
   the situation would be down there after seven kids? You'll have to 
   watch the film to find out. Or not. I couldn't give a fuck either way 
   to be honest.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What struck me about this segment is that everyone, Everyone, is 
   really nice to each other. The neighbours, the fellow ciggy punters, 
   the folks in the prison, even the police. Everyone is nice to each 
   other in this sequence. Then after watching I'm sucked back into 2020 
   where everyone seems to have, during lockdown, taken their unbalanced 
   online personas out into the real world which has resulted in 
   conflict, raging arguments of political absolutes that no one will 
   budge from, videos of supermarket customers screaming at staff about 
   their right not to wear masks, rising racial tensions, lunatics in 
   charge everywhere that people will follow into oblivion just because 
   what they preach adheres to that person's world view, and people just 
   being total cunts to each other. What happened to the human race?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anyway, the second sequence involves a very rich wife of a business 
   magnate (Loren) picking up a lover she met the night before 
   (Mastrioanni). He's a quiet, poetic person who's soft words have 
   seemingly changed Loren's world view, as before she was an entitled 
   trophy wife. Now she's an entitled trophy wife driving a Rolls Royce 
   while talking about how she can give up everything just to be with 
   Mastrioanni, who looks doubtful from the the outset as Loren spends 
   her time shunting her Rolls into the car in front of her, nearly 
   running people over, and generally moaning about money, because she's 
   never had to do without it. Most remarkable here is the contrast 
   between how the actors play these characters compared to the first segment.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Third and last part involves high class hooker Loren living in an 
   apartment on the famous Piazza Navona in Rome (I get the feeling they 
   underplayed how much this would actually cost). She's a nice girl at 
   heart and chooses her clients only if she likes them. She has 
   neighbours who don't approve however. An old Nona and her husband 
   know the truth about Loren, but their Grandson idolises her and won't 
   believe she's a prostitute. He's just about the enter the priesthood 
   and it seems that Loren's presence is putting a spanner in the work. 
   Mastrioanni's role in this part is playing a politician customer of 
   Loren who is totally head over heels with her and continually tries 
   to get her into bed while failing miserably.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This part also contains the most famous part of this film, where 
   Loren does a striptease for Marcello. Up, periscope! Mind you, it's 
   Sofia Loren we're talking about here, so don't expect to see 
   anything. This is a great film that wears its heart on it sleeve. 
   Acted perfectly. Looking perfect. ETC.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Mario
    Merola gives up the cigarette smuggler/mob boss with a 
   heart/straight businessman role in Naples and relocates to the 
   countryside as a humble zappatore (hoer), breaking his back day and 
   night on the land, with loyal wife by his side. Mario doesn't mind, 
   as all his money has gone to educating his son. The son in question 
   is now a fully qualified lawyer, and is all set to head off to the 
   big city (Naples of course) but not before Mario belts out another 
   one his songs, as he is won't to do in these films.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After a tearful farewell, Mario settles back into rural life, 
   complicated by a money lender leaning on him to pay back his debts 
   and the sinister interests of the local mafia Don (played by a suave 
   Rik Battalgia). Mario can't pay back the money lender, who seems to 
   have an ulterior motive, but luckily the local policeman is watching 
   Mario's back and tells him to avoid the Don at all costs.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Months pass without Mario and his distraught wife hearing from their 
   son, and Mario dispatches to farm workers to track him down. One of 
   these is played by Lucio Montanaro, who, if you've watched any of 
   these films, you've definitely seen. He's the comedy element in this 
   film, which is kind of needed as most of the film involves people 
   either weeping, crying madly, or screaming in each other's faces. 
   When he gets to Naples he finds the son won't talk to him and gets 
   his sexy assistant to hand him a 100,000 lire note and a blank bit of 
   paper, which Mario pretends to his increasingly depressed wife is an 
   apologetic letter from his son.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You see, his son has hooked up with a rich blonde heiress and is 
   pretending to be a rich land owner orphan from a family of judges. 
   He's ashamed of his rustic roots, to the point of even pretending his 
   mother is a mad woman who mistakes him for her dead son. A tsunami of 
   tears later, Mario's wife is on her death bed, Mario's heading to New 
   York to get his son back, and the Mafia Don wants that land off of Mario.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    My favourite bit in this strangely watchable drama is when Mario 
   turns up at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel to confront his son. The 
   reaction of the posh people is so over the top its like Mario walked 
   in naked, covered from head to toe in shit, rather than looking like 
   a slightly dishevelled man. The best bit comes just after as Mario 
   resolves the situation with a loud, sad song about how his son has 
   abandoned him. Great stuff.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once again its Merola that makes these films, his overweight, 
   emotional character is at odds with the usual hard case with a 
   moustache you get in these films. His humanity once again shines 
   through. I guess that's why he's so loved in Napoli.</FONT></FONT></P>

   that's for sure.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Oliver and Oswald do not take their double bereavement's well. They 
   become obsessed with death and decay, chronicling the process with a 
   series of stop-motion photographs of various, mainly black and white 
   animals, which gives Greenaway a chance to show animals rapidly 
   decaying to Michael Nyman's frantic soundtrack, expanding on the 
   lietmotif as the size of the animal increases (similar to <B>THE FALLS</B>,
    again).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    &quot;Symmetry is all!&quot; cries one of the twins at one point, 
   and that is one of the many exhausting things this film is about. 
   Every shot is near enough symmetrical, The twins' physical movements 
   are symmetrical. There are countless references to twos, couples, 
   doubles, mirror images. Mind you, there are countless references to 
   black and white animals, and cages, and the alphabet. It's kind of 
   Greenaway's thing.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film is gorgeous to look at. When they showed it on UK tv all 
   those years ago, it looked amazing. Sadly, the VHS they released for 
   this, and Greenaway's other films, where of terrible quality. Now 
   I've watched it in HD I can say that once again it looks amazing. But 
   isn't that superficiality? That's the main criticism levelled at 
   Greenaway. Where's the emotion? Where's the depth? Characters in his 
   films speak oddly, act oddly. There's no real momentum. It must be 
   said these films aren't for everybody. I liked it though.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Eighties were a golden age for Greenaway, but he seemed to lose 
   it in the nineties, with the over-the-top <B><A HREF="baby_of_macon_1993.htm">BABY
