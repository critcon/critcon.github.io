# critcon.github.io

This GitHub org and its repos serve as an archival record of critcononline.com: ”Critical Condition - The Online Magazine Of Obscure & Bizarre Films” by Fred Adelman. 

The critcononline.com domain is set to expire in September 2022, so this archive serves as a separate, fully functional mirror pulled on January 22, 2022 via `wget`. No matter what happens to the domain name and website hosting in the future, Fred’s work should not be forgotten or lost.

Some images have been re-exported or otherwise minified to reduce file sizes with no discernable loss to quality.

All media belongs to its respective owners. All scanning, editing, and uploading labor and original writing is Fred Adelman’s alone. No ownership via this org or it users is claimed or intended.
