    Uncle Francis (Greg Lewis) to scrape together the ransom money, Mike 
   and David do their separate investigations, which leads them to the 
   same person: the rental manager (Nick Nicholson) who leased the 
   helicopter that Xavier used to kidnap the little girl. When the 
   manager ends up dead, Mike and David reluctantly agree to work 
   together in their common goal to rescue what each believes to be his 
   daughter. That doesn't mean that they don't get into the occasional 
   dust-up with each other, though. After following a tip that the 
   helicopter pilot hangs out at a bar frequented by mercenaries (I 
   smell a bar fight!), our unlikely duo pick up a clue which leads the 
   to a Chinese restaurant that is actually a front for a whorehouse. 
   They rescue a young prostitute, who gives them their next clue to the 
   location of the little girl. That location is a warehouse where 
   Xavier holds illegal martial arts competitions. It's also where the 
   little girl is being held. Mike and David get themselves into a 
   pickle when they are captured and forced to fight each other to the 
   death by Xavier. They are saved by a private detective hired by 
   Howard, who grabs the little girl and takes off without them. The 
   finale finds that the kidnapping was actually orchestrated by Howard, 
   who plans on killing Lillian and her daughter in order to inherit 
   Lillian's family fortune. Mike and David arrive in the nick of time 
   and foil the plot, but the question remains: Who is the father, Mike 
   or David? I'm afraid we never find out, as the film majorly cops-out 
   in the final scene.&nbsp; This Philippines-lensed actioner suffers 
   immensely from the outrageously bad acting talents of Dale 
   &quot;Apollo&quot; Cook (misspelled &quot;Appollo&quot; in the 
   opening credits), who spends the majority of his screen time emoting 
   with a toothpick between his teeth, and bulky Evan Lurie, whose 
   monotone line delivery (not to mention hair so oily, Saudi Arabia 
   might want to look into drilling into his head) makes Arnold 
   Schwarzenegger look Shakespearean in comparison. Director/co-scripter 
   Jeno Hodi (<B><A HREF="deadly_obsession_1988.htm">DEADLY OBSESSION</A></B> 
   - 1988), who also plays garlic-loving Attila, the private detective 
   hired by Howard, tries to distract us from the awful acting abilities 
   of the two main stars by offering numerous martial arts battles and 
   gunfights, but the sad fact is every time they open their mouths, we 
   are automatically drawn to their awfulness. Some of the action scenes 
   are quite lively, as people are thrown through doors and windows, 
   riddled with bullets (lots of bloody squibs) or simply beaten to a 
   pulp, but believe me when I tell you this: Director Jodi could have 
   made a much better film if he simply made his two actors mute and had 
   them communicating with each other using sign language, although I'm 
   sure that many middle fingers would have to be shown. The fact that 
   we never find out who the little girl's father is also hurt my 
   opinion of the film. In the end, we're led to believe that Mike, 
   David and Lillian live happily ever after, neither man anxious to 
   find out who is the real father (I suspected this was coming when, 
   earlier in this film, Mike and David discover they have the same 
   blood type). I hate films that promise something and then fail to 
   deliver. Also starring Jeff Iorio, Jim Moss and an uncredited

   A lot of people think this is another one of Godfrey Ho's 
   cut-and-paste martial arts flicks (Ho only scripted this one, using 
   the name &quot;Benny Ho&quot;) that he made for producers Joseph Lai 
   and Betty Chan, but they would be wrong. As usual the <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</A> 
   lists Godfrey Ho as the director, but this was actually directed by 
   Philip Ko (<B><A HREF="angel_on_fire_1995.htm">ANGEL ON FIRE</A></B> 
   - 1995) and, unlike Ho patchwork martial arts films, this one is 100% 
   ninja-free. Ko has taken some unreleased Hong Kong gangster film, 
   inserted newly-shot footage featuring Caucasian actors (including 
   Mike Abbott and Mark Watson) and rejiggered the plot. The core of the 
   story concerns gangster Peter Lin, who is working in concert with 
   Barton (Abbott) to take over the territory of female crime boss Helen 
   Mo (Juliet Chan). Charlie, who is working with unemployed ex-cop John 
   Foley (Watson), infiltrates Peter's gang with plans on killing Peter 
   and Barton, who killed Charlie's best frie<A HREF="angels_blood_mission_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/angel's blood mission vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>nd
    Sam and stole a briefcase full of money that Sam was delivering to 
   Helen. With me so far? It get's more confusing. Every twenty minutes 
   or so, John Foley can be seen getting into fights with Barton's white 
   goons and either beats them with his fists or guns them down. Arthur, 
   another unemployed guy working with Charlie, goes to work for Helen 
   as an enforcer (When Helen tells him that her main business is in the 
   &quot;service&quot; industry, making men happy, Arthur says, &quot;You
    want me to service men?!&quot;) and begins beating the crap out of 
   Peter's men. Peter and Barton take notice and they order their men to 
   kill Arthur, but they fail miserably every time they try. Arthur and 
   some of Helen's goons go to Peter's casino and clear it out when they 
   light some phony sticks of TNT (!) Peter retaliates and sends some of 
   his men to Helen's massage parlor, where they light some smoke bombs 
   and clear out the joint (These two crime bosses are utter geniuses!). 
   Helen issues a challenge to Peter: One game of poker between Arthur 
   and Peter. The stakes: Helen's prostitution racket vs. Peter's casino 
   operation. When Arthur draws four aces to Peter's four kings (they 
   both cheated), things turn ugly, a fight ensues and Helen gives Peter 
   three days to move out. Arthur quits Helen's gang (He says to her, 
   &quot;I'm declaring myself free!&quot;) and Helen orders his death 
   (which happens). After all this, Peter and Helen join forces when 
   Charlie finally surfaces to bring both gangs down. He takes on 
   everyone single-handedly while John Foley fights Barton in a battle 
   to the death.&nbsp; While the film doesn't make an ounce of sense, 
   there's plenty of bloody violence to keep your eyes occupied. People 
   are sliced with knives, beaten with pipes, shot with a speargun, 
   riddled with bullets and killed with a forklift. During Arthur's 
   death sequence, he spends most of his time fighting Peter's goons 
   with a huge knife sticking out of his stomach. Before he dies, Arthur 
   manages to pull one goon down on some spikes of a wrought iron fence. 
   In an unbelievable ending to the scene, Arthur's girlfriend Sylvia 
   comes running to him while he is lying on the ground and incredibly 
   says, &quot;Arthur, are you alright?&quot; Bitch, can't you see the 
   huge knife in his gut and his bloody shirt? Some other 
   &quot;highlights&quot; include some lucky guy getting his eye poked 
   out with a broken bottle, Charlie's hyper-kinetic fight scene in the 
   finale and a scene where John Foley shows one of his opponents some 
   comical razzle-dazzle footwork, only to shoot him when he is done. 
   Also hilarious is Mike Abbott's obvious stunt double in the final 
   fight. Since there are no ninja outfits to hide the actors' faces, 
   it's plain to see some Oriental stuntman was used when Abbott had to 
   do backflips and high kicks. Forget the plot and enjoy the violence. 
   I can see why people would confuse this with a Godfrey Ho film. It's 
   confusing as hell and follows the same narrative structure as Ho's 
   patchwork films, except there are no ninjas in sight. On-screen

   Fun Filipino film, a mixture of martial arts action and comedy 
   elements. Legend says that a pouch recently stolen from the grave of 
   a 10th Century Chinese scientist contains a substance so powerful, 
   whomever is in possession of it can rule or destroy the world. 
   Professional boxer Calvin Jefferson (James Iglehart; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Savage1973">SAVAGE</A></B> 
   - 1973; <B><A HREF="action.htm#FightingMad1978">FIGHTING MAD</A></B> 
   - 1978) and his new bride Marlene (Shirley Washington; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#DarktownStrutters">DARKTOWN
    STRUTTERS</A></B> - 1974) are visiting Hong Kong on their honeymoon 
   and get mixed up in the whole mess when one of the bad guys places 
   the pouch in a statue of Buddha that Marlene bought as a souvenir. 
   The bad guy does this to insure that the pouch will make it out of 
   Hong Kong customs and to Manila, where head bad guy, Leo King (a bald 
   Ken Metcalfe, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Zucchero, who 
   also has a role here), plans on retrieving it and ruling the world. 
   While in Hong Kong, Calvin saves the life of mute peasant Chow Lee 
   (Chiquito; <B><A HREF="arizona_kid_1971.htm">ARIZONA KID</A></B> -

   who was knocked-out and thrown in the ocean by three street thugs 
   after saving a young woman from being raped. Calvin jumps in the 
   ocean and saves his life and from that moment on, Chow Lee (who 
   Calvin renames &quot;Charley&quot;) is indebted to lifelong servitude 
   to Calvin and becomes an unwanted third wheel in Ca<A HREF="bamboo_gods_and_iron_men_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bamboo gods &amp; iron men poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>lvin
    and Marlene's honeymoon. No matter how much they try to ditch him, 
   Charley says close behind them, stowing away on the ship to Manila 
   and eventually saving Calvin's life when Mr. King's goons try to 
   steal the Buddha (Charley's very good in the arts that are martial). 
   Calvin and Marlene eventually welcome Charley into their lives and 
   it's a good thing, too, because Mr. King sends wave after wave of bad 
   guys to steal the Buddha. Charley teaches Calvin the finer points of 
   the martial arts to go along with his boxing skills (which aren't 
   very good when you're facing kung-fu experts) and when Mr. King 
   finally steals the Buddha and finds that the pouch is not in it, 
   Calvin will have to use his new-found skills when Mr. King believes 
   he stole the pouch. Mr. King kidnaps Marlene, which forces Calvin and 
   Charley to figure out where the pouch is and deliver it to Mr. King 
   before Marlene is killed. Charley discovers the true location of the 
   pouch and races to Mr. King's hideout with an inept police detective 
   in tow to stop Calvin from making a big mistake. Everything works out 
   in the end when it is discovered that the &quot;powerful&quot; 
   substance in the pouch is nothing but simple gunpowder (powerful in 
   the 10th Century, no so much today). Everyone, including Mr. King, 
   have a good laugh when the gunpowder explodes in their faces, making 
   everyone look like performers in a minstrel show. Oh, and Charley 
   regains his ability to speak thanks to the explosion!&nbsp; This 
   Filipino action film, directed by Cesar Gallardo (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#HustlerSquad">HUSTLER
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1976) and produced by Cirio H. Santiago (<B><A HREF="action.htm#TNT Jackson">TNT
    JACKSON</A></B> - 1975), is a funny, if derivative, martial arts 
   variation of <B><A HREF="maltese_falcon_1941.htm">THE MALTESE FALCON</A></B> 
   (1941) and bears striking similarities to director Robert Clouse's <B><A HREF="golden_needles_1974.htm">GOLDEN
    NEEDLES</A></B>, made the same year as this. Lighthearted in tone, 
   yet still containing bloody deaths and scenes of rape, <B><A HREF="bamboo_gods_and_iron_men_1974b.htm">BAMBOO
    GODS AND IRON MEN</A></B> (also known as <B><A HREF="black_kung_fu_1974.htm">BLACK
    KUNG FU</A></B>) treads a fine line between comedy and violence and 
   succeeds most of the time. James Iglehart and Shirley Washington are 
   surprisingly good as the newlywed couple and popular Filipino 
   comedian Chiquito is very funny as the mute Charley. While he's a 
   little too broad at times and his martial arts skills questionable at 
   best (for a martial arts master, he sure does get knocked-out a lot), 
   Chiquito makes a good silent partner for Iglehart. There are some 
   funny sequences between the two, such as when Mr. King's head 
   henchmen, Ambrose (Eddie Garcia; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeastOfBlood1970">BEAST
    OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1970; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomanHunt1972">THE
    WOMAN HUNT</A></B> - 1972), brings the duo to a massage parlor under 
   false pretenses, which results in some hand-to-hand combat between 
   the parties (and lots of screaming topless women) and Charley running 
   out of the building bare-assed. There are plenty of badly-staged 
   martial arts fights on view, but it is the goofy comedy (especially 
   the unbelievable ending) by the game cast, including Ken Metcalfe 
   (who seems to be in at least 80% of the Filipino action flicks I have 
   seen), that will suck you in. Not a good film by any stretch of the 
   imagination (the production values are horrid and the editing and 
   sound recording are piss-poor), but an entertaining one nonetheless.

    BLACK DRAGON</A><A NAME="BlackDragon1974"></A> (1974) -</B> Hong 
   Kong/Philippines co-production that mixes martial arts sequences with 
   the tale of the grimy life of an undocumented worker on the mean 
   streets of the Philippines. The film is more notable, though, for Ron 
   Van Clief's screen debut in the title role (although he's a secondary 
   character at best) and also for the wildly inappropriate bluegrass 
   music (heavy on the harmonica and the banjo) playing on the 
   soundtrack that totally ruins some of the early fight scenes. When 
   his brother, Chi Fu Shi (Thompson Kao Kang), returns from the 
   Philippines to his small Chinese farming village a refined and well-dressed
    businessman (although it's plain to see that his personality has not 
   changed for the better), Tai Lin (Jason Pai Piao; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BloodyParrot">BLOODY

   immigrants end up when they can't find any decent work. After 
   witnessing one of his fellow &quot;dockers&quot; being beaten-up for 
   moving too slow, Tai intervenes and ends up defeating a bunch of the 
   Big Boss' men (Films like this don't assign a name to the big boss, 
   preferring to just call them the &quot;Big Boss&quot;). This doesn't 
   go unnoticed by the Big Boss, who convinces a na&iuml;ve Tai to sign 
   a contract to work for him as a &quot;gang leader&quot; at the docks 
   (basically making him no better than the people he just defeated). On 
   the first day of his new position, a rival gang headed by a Black 
   (Ron Van Clief) and a Filipino (George Estregan) invade the docks, 
   where Tai proves his worth by single-handedly defeating them in a 
   fight. Tai is about to learn the hard way that he's actually working 
   for the wrong side and is exploiting his own people, as the rival 
   gang and Tai's new girlfriend, Ching Kwei (Nancy Veronica) open his 
   eyes about what is really going on at the docks: The Big Boss is 
   illegally exporting huge quantities of opium back to China and 
   throughout the rest of the world. Tai quits his job in disgust and 
   joins the rival gang, but he soon learns that the contract he signed 
   is legally binding (by a crooked Filipino law system) and he has one 
   of two choices: Work for the Big Boss for five years doing menial, 
   back-breaking jobs or pay a $100,000 penalty. Being a man of his 
   word, Tai has no choice but to work for the Big Boss, but Siao Mao, 
   without Tai's knowledge, sneaks into the Big Boss' house to steal the 
   contract. Siao Mao is killed, but not before delivering the contract 
   to Tai, who finally believes he is now man enough to wear the shoes 
   his mother made him. Together with his unnamed Black and Filipino 
   cohorts, Tai begins dismantling the Big Boss' operation, one 
   bone-crushing encounter after another until Tai learns the awful 
   truth about his brother's involvement in this whole mess.&nbsp; This 
   martial arts action flick, directed by Tommy Loo Chun (real name: Lu 
   Chin Ku), who also directed the weird horror/fantasy <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#MagicCurse1977">MAGIC

   released in the 70's as drive-in and grindhouse fodder. It's 
   hideously dubbed, re-edited and renamed to appease English-speaking 
   audiences. The title <B><A HREF="black_dragon_1974b.htm">THE BLACK DRAGON</A></B> 
   is highly misleading because the majority of the film is about Tai's 
   plight. Ron (here billed as &quot;Ronnie&quot;) Van Clief plays a 
   supporting role here and has fairly little to do besides appear in a 
   few fight scenes. The fact that he and George Estregan (who is billed 
   as &quot;Jorge Estraga&quot; on the ad mats) are not even given 
   proper names for their characters speaks volumes about their 
   importance to the plot. Van Clief would return with more prominent

   to a close and the 90's were upon us, director Teddy Page (using his 
   &quot;Irvin Johnson&quot; pseudonym) stopped making his exciting 
   brand of Filipino war actioners (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#WarWithoutEnd">WAR

   - 1988) and switched to the martial arts genre, thanks to the glut of 
   war films that over-saturated the home video market. Page managed to 
   bring his usual repertoire of stock actors over to his martial arts 
   flicks, but since none of them were actual martial artists, he 
   brought in Dale &quot;Apollo&quot; Cook as his leading man (Page also 
   used Cook in his <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#FistOfSteel1991">FIST
    OF STEEL</A></B>, made the same year as this). Unfortunately, Cook 
   isn't much of an actor (check out his abysmal performance in <B><A HREF="#AmericanKickboxer2">AMERICAN
    KICKBOXER 2</A></B> [1993]), but he is a pretty good fighter, so 
   your enjoyment level of <B><A HREF="blood_ring_1991b.htm">BLOOD RING</A></B> 
   will depend on your tolerance for stiff acting by a lead actor (and I 
   mean frozen corpse stiff). Alcoholic fighter Max Rivers (Cook) makes 
   a living by throwing matches in illegal back alley martial arts 
   fights for crooked fight promoter Dingo (Norma<A HREF="blood_ring_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood ring vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>n

   by Susan (Andrea Lamatsch; <B><A HREF="action.htm#SuddenThunder1990">SUDDEN
    THUNDER</A></B> - 1990, who is stiffer than Cook), the wife of Max's 
   best friend Philip (Steve Tartalia), who is also a fighter. Susan 
   tells Max that Philip has disappeared and she fears that his manager, 
   champion martial artist Don Carlio (Don Nakaya Neilsen), is 
   responsible. At first, Max thinks Susan is over-reacting, but when 
   she goes to Don Carlio's office to do some snooping of her own, is 
   shot in the arm and almost kidnapped by Don Carlio's head henchman 
   Stevens (James Gaines), Max does some investigating of his own and 
   finds out (after beating the crap out of some of Don Carlio's 
   security guards; one of them played by Nick Nicholson) that Philip 
   was shipped off to South America to fight in a big martial arts 
   tournament. When Don Carlio finds out what a good fighter Max really 
   is, he has Stevens kidnap Susan (she and Max are ex-lovers) and holds 
   her as an insurance policy, forcing Max to work for him as a fighter. 
   Max and Susan and sent to South America, where Max is thrown into a 
   dungeon cell and only let out to fight tournament matches. Max's 
   first fight is against D'Executioner (Cris Aguilar) and when Max 
   doesn't give his all, Don Carlio trots out Susan and Stevens starts 
   to fondle her, causing Max's blood to boil and win the match. When 
   Max and Susan learn that Philip is dead, they escape the dungeon and 
   hide out in the jungle, but Don Carlio recaptures Susan (after Max 
   kills Stevens by impaling him on a tree branch), forcing Max to 
   return to Don Carlio's compound in Rambo mode, blasting his way in 
   with a shotgun and sticks of dynamite. This leads to the inevitable 
   final confrontation, where Max must fight Don Carlio in the ring 
   (where the ropes are lined with barbed wire!) for Susan's life. Care 
   to guess who wins?&nbsp; Compared to Teddy Page's 80's war actioners, <B>BLOOD
    RING</B> is a major disappointment. It's apparent that Page is 
   working with a smaller budget than usual, but there's no excuse for 
   some of the technical ineptitude on display here, including terrible 
   sound recording (the boom mike can be seen in several scenes), sloppy 
   camerawork and lighting and the fact that South America seems to be 
   populated by Filipino and American expatriate extras (including Steve 
   Rogers and Jim Moss). Add to that the fact that many of the lead 
   actors on display here are just terrible (besides Cook, Andrea 
   Lamatsch sounds exactly like a female version of Arnold 
   Schwarzenegger with the emotional range to match and Don Nakaya 
   Neilsen is so wooden, he could be the substitute for the mulch you 
   spread around your garden) and even the usually dependable Jim Gaines 
   looks to be slumming here. The only worthwhile fight scenes in this 
   film are when a street gang play a game of &quot;Keep Away&quot; with 
   Max's bottle of Jack Daniels and the final bloody match between Max 
   and Don Carlio in the barbed wire ring. All the other fights are 
   pretty disposable and lack any oomph. The poverty of the production 
   (all of the fighting scenes in the ring have no lighting on the 
   outside of the ropes to hide the fact that hardly anyone is in the 
   audience) and the illogical storyline (When Susan learns husband 
   Philip is dead, she immediately jumps in the sack with Max. Way to 
   grieve, Susan!) leaves little to admire here, even if it did spawn a 
   sequel, <B><A HREF="blood_ring_2_1994.htm">BLOOD RING 2</A></B>

    -</B> This ridiculous semi-intentionally funny Filippino martial 
   arts actioner should only be viewed in a state of total inebriation. 
   A chap by the name of Bruce Lee (Bruce Ly) returns to his Philippines 
   coastal hometown after being away in China, Thailand and Japan 
   learning different fighting techniques, only to find his town overrun 
   by a bloodthirsty crimelord and his many goons. As soon as Bruce sets 
   foot in town, he is attacked by four men in a car (one guy eats a 
   razor blade and swigs from a bottle of booze to prove how tough he 
   is). After defeating them (and getting his pretty white suit all 
   dirty), he heads to his home where he learns about what has been 
   going on since he has been away. The townspeople are glad he has 
   returned and look on him as their saviour. After the crimelord has 
   his men kill most of Bruce's friends (including a little boy), Bruce 
   goes on the warpath but the crimelord sets him up to take the fall in 
   the shooting death of another young boy. He is arrested and thrown in 
   jail, but escapes after making some fake blood and tricking the 
   jailer into thinking that he's hurt. Bruce must prove his innocence 
   as well as bring down the crimelord. Now<A HREF="chaku_master_1976_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/chaku master dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="209" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   using the alias &quot;Mario&quot;, Bruce defends a young woman and 
   her father from two thugs named Lui and Fedal. To show her 
   appreciation, the young woman gives him a job on her farm shucking 
   coconuts. Finding out that the young woman is the sister of the boy 
   he is accused of killing, Bruce leaves to end the life of the 
   crimelord. His overseas training comes in handy, as he will have to 
   fight Chinese, Thai and Japanese fighters (including a lengthy fight 
   with a sumo wrestler) in order to get to the crimelord. It all ends 
   on the high seas, as Bruce and a sympathetic cop fight the crimelord 
   and his henchman on a junk. Be prepared for an abrupt ending.&nbsp; I 
   can't begin to describe how utterly delirious this film actually is, 
   but I'll try. There's one scene where Bruce defeats a guy named Nando 
   and he then does a backflip into some chick's moving Mustang. They 
   park underneath a tree and begin to make out when a bunch of bad guys 
   fall out of the tree and fight Bruce. After he defeats them, he goes 
   back to making out with the girl. She begins to give him a blowjob 
   and we see the look of ecstacy on Bruce's face, intercut with scenes 
   of zoo animals eating and licking their food! There's another scene 
   of a young boy getting shot in the chest and when the dying kid asks 
   Bruce if he's going to be OK, he says, &quot;Don't worry, it's only a 
   scratch.&quot; The boy then dies. It's quite plain to see that this 
   print comes from England because every time Bruce pulls his nunchucks 
   out of his socks, there's a huge edit which concludes with the bad 
   guys lying on the ground and Bruce is no longer holding the 
   nunchucks. The film is missing over four minutes of nunchuck action, 
   thanks to Britain's stance on showing how nunchucks are used may 
   influence children to perform copycat violence (a stance which has 
   since been abolished). It's really difficult to tell if 
   director/producer Luis San Juan (<B><A HREF="dolphys_angels_1980.htm">DOLPHY'S
    ANGELS</A></B> - 1980) was trying to make a comedy here (the dubbing 
   makes it seem so, as there were a few moments when I actually laughed 
   out loud at what was being said). The reason why it is so hard to 
   tell is because Filippino productions have no problem mixing 
   slapstick with extreme violence (including the death of children). 
   What's even harder to establish is the year this film was made. 
   Judging from the bell-bottom trousers and disco-style large collar 
   shirts, I want to say anywhere between the years of 1976 - 1980. But, 
   knowing how the Fillipinos tend to catch on to American fads later 
   than most other countries, this film could have been made as late as 
   1984. I did find a 1979 Filippino film titled <B><A HREF="they_call_him_bruce_lee_1979.htm">THEY
    CALL HIM BRUCE LEE</A></B> on <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</A> 
   that sounds a lot like this film, but the IMDB lists a different 
   director (Francis Posadas). We all know how inaccurate that site can 
   be at times, though, don't we? <B>THE CH</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">AKU</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B> MASTER</B>

    OF THE NINJAS</A><A NAME="Clash Of Ninjas"></A> (1986) -</B> Another 
   Filmark International Ltd. production from producer Tomas Tang and 
   director Godfrey Ho (using the name &quot;Wallace Chan&quot; here), 
   where they take an unreleased Hong Kong martial arts flick and badly 
   intercut new footage featuring Caucasian actors (see my reviews of <B><A HREF="#Diamond Ninja Force">DIAMOND
    NINJA FORCE</A></B> [1986] and <B><A HREF="#Instant Rage">INSTANT RAGE</A></B> 
   [1988] for more Tang/Ho goodness). This one deals with a black market 
   that trades in illegal human organs. The film opens with some Chinese 
   dude being led against his will to an operating room, where a team of 
   smiling white doctors remove his eyes and kidneys and put the in 
   glass jars. We then cut to the board room of the evil Mr. Roy (Louis 
   Roth), who is discussing prices of body parts with his cohorts (all 
   white, of course), when he gets a call saying that all his 
   &quot;guinea pigs&quot; have escaped from the <A HREF="clash_of_the_ninja_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/clash of the ninja vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>basement
    operating room. Mr. Roy becomes a black-masked ninja and, in one of 
   the worst edited scenes of old and new footage (check out Roy's 
   throwing star emblem on his headgear and compare it with the old 
   footage), proceeds to slice and dice a bunch of Chinese men and women 
   in a field with a sword and throwing stars. Tony (Paul Torcha), an 
   Interpol agent, tries to intercept a money payment from goons sent by 
   Mafia chieftan Mr. Foster (Joe Redner), but after yelling, &quot;Hold 
   it there, we're Interpol!&quot; and capturing the goons after a short 
   fight, another black ninja (who works for Mr. Roy) kills the goons 
   with poison darts from his blowgun and then disappears into thin air 
   (it's hilarious in it's ineptitude). Mr. Roy puts a hit out on the 
   final four guinea pigs who escaped from his basement. Two are killed 
   trying to hide in a church (&quot;Maybe God can help!&quot;) by a 
   black ninja disguised as a priest, who then sets a cop on fire with 
   daggers that spit flames (&quot;Holy smokes, a flamethrower!&quot;) 
   and then disappears in a puff of smoke. The final two guinea pigs 
   hide out with an uncle, while Tony and his black partner (who is 
   sliced numerous times with a sword and sent to the hospital, where he 
   is bandaged head-to-toe!) and Mr. Roy and his associates try to find 
   them, for totally different reasons. The finale finds red ninja Tony 
   (and his amazing spinning head!) fighting black ninja Mr. Roy (and 
   his trusty bullwhip!) in a duel to the death. One of them blows up in 
   a puff of red and white smoke. Care to guess which one?&nbsp; Full of 
   nonsensical scenes, such as when police surround a black ninja in a 
   circle (what I call a &quot;Polish firing squad&quot;) and shoot him 
   dozens of times, yet he still escapes (!), <B><A HREF="clash_of_the_ninja_1986b.htm">CLASH
    OF THE NINJAS</A></B> may be fragmented and incoherent, but it is 
   never boring. From the opening graphic surgery, to the numerous 
   fights (where people are stabbed, pummeled, shot, impaled and blown 
   up), car chases and near-rapes, this film moves at a brisk clip. Half 
   the fun of watching these types of films is for the bad dubbing and 
   insane dialogue and this one doesn't disappoint. As with most films 
   of this ilk, they are dubbed by Brits who try to talk American with 
   hilarious results. They pronounce &quot;mafia&quot; as 
   &quot;mafier&quot; and &quot;ninja&quot; as &quot;ninjer&quot; and 
   some of the dialogue is priceless. One guy ask another: &quot;What's 
   the TV like here?&quot; He replies: &quot;Great. Two channels and we 
   watch it a lot!&quot; A female hitwoman says this to her mark: 
   &quot;Hello, big boy. Shaving your lovely beard so we can be 
   closer?&quot; There's also a scene where Tony's girlfriend throws her 
   entire record collection at an invisible ninja (most of the records 
   stick to the wall in an unbelievable display of gravity) before the 
   ninja slashes her to death with a straight razor. I must have missed 
   straight razor training when I went to ninja school. The illegal 
   human organ angle is dropped after the first ten minutes but, if you 
   don't mind non-stop violence mixed with brain-frying lapses in logic, 
   you may find that you'll be laughing yourself into liking this. Also

    AGAINST NINJA</A><A NAME="CobraAgainstNinja"></A> (1987) -</B> 
   Another insane martial arts cut-and-paste flick from producer Joseph 
   Lai (for his IFD Films &amp; Arts Ltd. production company), only this 
   time he also directs (regular director Godfrey Ho only gets a story 
   credit here). The newly-shot footage finds master ninja Gordon 
   (Richard Harrison) being issued a &quot;ninja challenge card&quot; by 
   bad ninja Cobra (Stuart Smith). I think we know what that means: 
   Every 15 to 20 minutes, Gordon must fight Cobra's men until the 
   climatic showdown in the finale. The reworked old footage (which 
   looks to have come from some unreleased Indonesian action flick), 
   which takes up the majority of the film's running time, has Chester 
   heading home after a stint in the Army (His friends say to him as 
   he's leaving, &quot;Good luck, asshole!&quot;), only to find his 
   mother deeply in debt to Ringo, the local crimelord. One of Chester's 
   Army buddies, Kirk, goes undercover in Ringo's gang to find his <A HREF="cobra_against_ninja_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cobra vs. ninja vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>weakness,
    while Chester makes Ringo's life difficult on the outside, stealing 
   a suitcase full of money that was to be used for betting on a fight. 
   Meanwhile, Gordon's first fight is against &quot;The Green 
   Serpent&quot;, whom he easily defeats with a silver boomerang to the 
   back of his head! Chester returns home to find his mother dead and 
   his sister kidnapped by Raymond, Ringo's gangster brother. Chester 
   kills one of Raymond's men with a broken bottle and gets the location 
   of where his sister is being held. Kirk is hired as an assassin (he's 
   given the name &quot;The Killer Whale&quot;) and is told to kill 
   Gordon but, when the time comes, he can't pull the trigger (in one of 
   the film's badly-edited scenes that intercuts old and new footage). 
   Gordon's next fight is against &quot;The White Dolphin&quot;, whom he 
   kills rather quickly with his sword. Chester's sister is raped by 
   Raymond (a recurring theme in these flicks), but is saved by cop 
   David, another one of Chester's Army brothers. Chester and all his 
   Army buddies plant bombs at Ringo's headquarters, kill everyone and 
   blow up Ringo as he tries to get away in his boat. Gordon faces Cobra 
   in the final battle and they use swords, shields and spears. Gordon 
   slices up Cobra and then walks into the sunset, in one of the most 
   uneventful finales in this series of films.&nbsp; As with all of 
   producers Joseph Lai's and Tomas Tang's Hong Kong pastiches, this 
   film makes precious little sense, but offers tons of unintentional 
   entertainment value. Let's start off with the newly-shot footage. 
   Just so we know it's real ninjas that are fighting, they all wear brightly-colored
    headbands with the word &quot;Ninja&quot; emblazoned on the front. I 
   almost spit soda out of my nose when I saw Gordon bean one opponent 
   on the head with a boomerang. I did not know that piece of equipment 
   was part of a ninja's arsenal. As with all of these flicks, after a 
   fight, the winning ninja disappears into thin air. The intercutting 
   between old and new footage is also very obvious, though this one has 
   the forethought to have Harrison talk on the phone to people in the 
   old footage, thereby negating the need to match backgrounds. The 
   dubbing in this one is also pretty funny, such as when Ringo yells to 
   his girlfriend, &quot;You slimy, ugly whore of a bitch!&quot; before 
   putting a bullet between her eyes after finding out she was 
   unfaithful. There's also a scene where David is being branded with a 
   hot poker and the burly torturer laughs like a schoolgirl (!) and two 
   other choice bits of dialogue, when Carter says, &quot;The taste of 
   death is satisfying!&quot; after killing a bad guy and when Ringo's 
   two floozies (one who talks like a Brit trying to do a Brooklyn 
   accent!) tell him, &quot;You're too old to start over!&quot; after he 
   tells them he's leaving the country. After watching about a dozen of 
   these films (see my reviews for <B><A HREF="#NinjaMastersDeath">NINJA

   &quot;Temple Of The Panthers&quot; (Blade has to brand himself on the

   undercover in Hong Kong, Blade and Linda photograph Jim Baxter (Jim

   spotted and in the ensuing fight, Baxter escapes and hops a plane 
   back to Australia. Linda follows him to Perth and ends up getting

   girl in the pool for no reason at all!). Blade proves his trust to 
   Zukor by delivering a package of (fake) drugs and beating the crap 
   out of the hoods waiting for it (It was all a set-up by Zukor to test

   films), he is a wonderful martial artist and Trenchard-Smith (<B><A HREF="action.htm#ManFromHongKong">THE
    MAN FROM HONG KONG</A></B> - 1975) takes full advantage of Stazak's 
   strengths, putting him in peril as much as possible and filming the 
   fight scenes with a minimal amount of flashy editing techniques (some 
   fights are filmed without any edits at all). Trenchard-Smith relies 
   on Stazak's natural athletic abilities and always places the camera 
   at the correct angle to maximize the impact. The weirdest fight scene 
   doesn't involve Stazak at all, but rather his female partner Linda. 
   She takes on three thugs wearing rubber masks (a skull, a toothless 
   old man and a wild tusked boar) in an extensive sequence in a series 
   of abandoned buildings. My favorite part of that sequence is when she 
   rips the rubber skull mask off one of the thugs it reveals his 
   face...in skull makeup! It's obvious that Trenchard-Smith patterned 
   the look and feel of this film after <B><A HREF="miami_vice_tv_series_1984-1990.htm">MIAMI
    VICE</A></B> (1984 - 1990), as the guys wear pastel colored jackets 
   with rolled-up sleeves and tee shirts underneath and there are 
   musical interludes, such as the hilarious scene where 80's big-haired 
   Gemma dances provocatively in her leotard in front of Blade as he 
   bench-presses weights in a gym. There's also a fight scene where 
   Blade beats the snot out of several of Baxter's men with a broom 
   handle and most of the action plays out as shadows on a brick wall! 
   If you don't mind your action mindless (both Stazak and co-star Jim 
   Richards are credited as Fight Co-ordinators), the story absurd and 
   acting on an Ed Wood level, you could do a lot worse than this film. 
   One technical gaffe (revealing it's low budget) shows a cameraman's 
   hand as he tries to stop a falling stuntman from crashing into the 
   camera. Also starring Zale Daniel, Matthew Quartermaine and Brian 
   Fitzsimmons. A Celebrity Home Entertainment (VHS) Release. Also 
   available on British DVD (Region 2 PAL) from ILC Prime. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   who represents the unknown boss (only seen in the shadows) that owns 
   the drug-controlled karate killers. Mr G. and Madame Lee strike up a 
   deal, sending the killers to eliminate Mr. G.'s enemies. Their first 
   stop is a martial arts academy, where they kill everyone with swift

    NINJA FORCE</A><A NAME="Diamond Ninja Force"></A> (1986) -</B> This 
   is one of director Godfrey Ho's notorious cut-and-paste jobs where he 
   shoots about 15 - 20 minutes of new footage (usually featuring 
   Richard Harrison) and incorporates that footage into some unreleased 
   or unfinished Hong Kong flick. When construction workers unearth 
   human remains at a building site, the developer pays off the workers 
   to look the other way. It happens to be the burial site of the Black 
   Ninjas, who lost a major battle with the Diamond Ninja Force one 
   hundred years earlier and they, along with their treasure and magic, 
   were buried there. The decendant of the Black Ninjas hires a female 
   sorcerer to do her &quot;Devil Magic&quot; on the developer. She does 
   (she turns the sky black) and kills him in his limo. His daughter, 
   Fanny Wong, takes over <A HREF="diamond_ninja_force_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/diamond ninja force german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the

   It's not long after that the female sorcerer is working her magic on 
   Fanny and her family: Husband George and little son Bobo (Christ, she 
   must hate her child to give him the name &quot;Bobo&quot;!). Soon, 
   Fanny and Bobo are seeing ghosts and other strange things (floating 
   objects, strange noises, flowers wilting, etc.) and George thinks 
   that they are imagining it. George goes to Gordon (Harrison), who 
   happens to be the Golden Ninja Warrior (a decendant of the Diamond 
   Ninja Force), and asks for help with his wife and child (It's also 
   painfully obvious that this scene never happened, as it is a bad 
   editing job between old and new footage.). Gordon sends a detective 
   named Firecracker to babysit Fanny and Bobo when they still see 
   ghosts, as well as snakes and rats. Firecracker bolts out the door at 
   the first sign of trouble and runs back to Gordon (more bad 
   intercutting). Gordon tells Firecracker to go get sorcerer Magic Chan 
   and return to Fanny's house. While all this is happening, Gordon gets 
   into a series of fights with members of the Black Ninja clan. When 
   Bobo is attacked by demons, levitated in the air and made to eat 
   grass (!) and George is raped by a ghost, good sorcerer Magic Chan 
   arrives on the scene but forgot to bring his magic mirror (the stupid 
   oaf). He sends Firecracker to retrieve it and papers the house with 
   magic spells. What happens next is so unbelievable (and insanely 
   illogical), I refuse to describe it to you. You will just have to 
   experience it for yourself. You'll thank me for it.&nbsp; 
   Entertaining in it's badness, <B><A HREF="diamond_ninja_force_1986b.htm">DIAMOND

   As soon as you hear the opening guitar licks from Isaac Hayes' 
   &quot;Theme From Shaft&quot; on the soundtrack of this cheap 
   Philippines-lensed martial arts actioner, you know you are about to 
   watch something unoriginal and done to death a thousand times before. 
   But don't write it off just yet; there's more going on here than 
   meets the ear. The film opens with some black-clad ninjas following a 
   scared guy down a dark street and then cornering him in a swimming 
   pool, where they punch and kick him, eventually drowning him 
   (apparently, the guy can't hold his breath longer than ten seconds!). 
   We then switch to the headquarters of the World Organization of Peace 
   (WOP!), where the members are informed that three of their four 
   agents have been killed in Manila (the fourth hasn't been heard from 
   in a couple of days, but I'm willing to bet he's the guy we just saw 
   drowned in the pool) and they have received a letter from a terrorist 
   group called NOMAD demanding that unless a 45 million dollar ransom 
   is paid, the entire population of the Philippines will be wiped out. 
   To show they are serious, &quot;key figures will be annihilated, one 
   each week, beginning on the 25th of this month&quot; (Christ, I hope 
   it's not December!). WOP has discovered that NOMAD has stolen several 
   vials of a deadly bacterium and plans on using it, so the h<A HREF="enforcer_from_death_row_1978b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/enforcer from death row ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>eads
    of WOP (and not one of them looks Italian!) decide to bring in an 
   outsider to do their dirty work. That outsider is T.L. Young (Leo 
   Fong; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Killpoint">KILLPOINT</A></B> - 
   1984), a prisoner on Death Row who is about to be executed in the gas 
   chamber for a crime he didn't commit. WOP members bribe prison 
   officials to fake Young's death and WOP member Anderson (B.T. 
   Anderson) acts as Young's priest as they walk to the gas chamber, 
   where Young is given a pill to swallow as fake poison gas fills up 
   the chamber. Young's apparently dead body is quickly taken away by an 
   ambulance, he is revived, is informed of his mission and begins a 
   strenuous workout regime to get in shape. Young takes a new name, 
   &quot;Albert Lim&quot;, and flies to Manila, where he is supposed to 
   meet WOP informant Jose Cervantes, but NOMAD baddie Drago (Charlie 
   Davao) gets to him first, torturing and killing Jose by hanging his 
   body upside down in a cage while poisonous snakes bite his body. 
   Drago's boss, Mr. Spenser (Darnell Garcia), catches another spy 
   trying to infiltrate his organization, so he has his hulking black 
   sidekick, appropriately named Monster, tie the spy to the floor while 
   rats eat him alive. While searching Jose's room, Young runs into some 
   ninjas, but he fights them off, which leads to a car/motorcycle chase 
   where Young's car is firebombed. When Danny (George Estregan) is 
   nearly killed by Drago and Monster (by being lowered slowly into a 
   vat of acid like some old BATMAN episode), he escapes and joins 
   forces with Young to bring down NOMAD and rescue Danny's sister Vicky 
   (Lotis Key). The finale finds Young flying a helicopter and picking 
   up Spenser's car with a giant claw, depositing him in the ocean to 
   drown.&nbsp; This insane Filipino actioner, co-directed by Efren C.

   quitting after Venarius' chief lackey, Siegfried Schultz (Zachi Noy,

   Sigfried and his men (Cole even rips-off Siegfried's hook, leaving

   fires Siegfried on the spot!). When Venarius discovers that Cole is a 
   ninja, he sends his right-hand man, Mr. Parker (Constantin De

   with? That's right, Cole's lifetime enemy Hasegawa and he tells 
   Venarius that if he doesn't succeed in killing Cole, he will commit 
   hara-kiri! Hasegawa kills Frank, kidnaps Mary Ann and burns down the 
   plantation, forcing Cole to go into Master Ninja mode to rescue Mary

    sense of style and flair (the camerawork is especially good for a B-movie).
    It's extremely bloody (even if the first ten minutes are somewhat of 
   a cheat), as people are sliced, diced, impaled, decapitated, stabbed, 
   shot and dismembered. Even though it's plain to see that Nero (who 
   wears a white ninja outfit) is being doubled by a stuntman in some of 
   the more strenuous action sequences, especially when he's pitted 
   against Sho Kosugi (who wears a black ninja outfit), there are plenty 
   of bloody action set-pieces on view, such as Hasegawa killing Frank 
   while a tied-up Mary Ann is forced to watch and Cole's retribution as 
   he storms Venarius' highrise building and then his warehouse arena. 
   Christopher George is a hoot as Venarius (his death is pure comic 
   genius), as he screams out orders with a faint lisp. It's implied 
   (though not overtly) that his character is gay, even though his 
   indoor swimming pool is always stocked with beautiful women. When he 
   screams out, &quot;Where is my black ninja?&quot; during the 
   action-packed finale, I dare you not to laugh. Susan George is 
   basically wasted in a &quot;heroine in distress&quot; role, but I 
   have to admit I was surprised when husband Frank (who is impotent 
   from his chronic alcoholism) gives her permission to fuck Cole and 
   she doesn't hesitate to do so! This Philippines-lensed martial arts 
   actioner is colorful, exciting and even, at times, laugh-out-loud 
   funny (and not unintentionally so) and should be enjoyed by all chop 
   sockey fanatics, as well as action lovers in general. It works 
   exceptionally well because it never takes itself too seriously (Nero 
   even winks directly into the camera in the film's closing shot). 
   Thanks to the world-wide success of this film, producers Menahem 
   Golan and Yoram Globus made two equally successful, but unrelated, 
   sequels: <B><A HREF="revenge_of_the_ninja_1983.htm">REVENGE OF THE NINJA</A></B>

    Susie is well-versed in the martial arts, because wave after wave of 
   kung-fu fighting goons, the minions of head bad guy Erik (co-scripter 
   Ken Metcalfe), try to kill her every chance they get. Susie soon 
   teams up with burly bartender Pete (Peter Cooper; Santiago's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Stryker1983">STRYKER</A></B> 
   - 1983) and local kung-fu expert Rey (Rey Malonzo; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Classified Operatio">CLASSIFIED
    OPERATION</A></B> - 1985, billed here as &quot;Reymond King&quot;) 
   to find out what happened to Bonnie and why people will kill to make 
   sure they don't find her. Susie finds her sister's camera and when 
   the photos are developed, she finds a picture of Chuck Donner (Darby 
   Hinton; <B><A HREF="malibu_express_1985.htm">MALIBU EXPRESS</A></B> - 
   1985), Erik's martial arts champion and chief enforcer (In the 
   beginning of the film, we see Chuck killing an opponent in the ring 
   by impaling him on a sword-tipped pole). Susie heads to Erik's 
   nightclub, The Arena (where audience members watch people beat the 
   stuffing out of each other on a stage), and cozies-up to Chuck, 
   telling him that she's looking for a place to work out. Erik is 
   immediately suspicious and so is his crime partner Grip (Vic Diaz; 
   Santiago's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Savage1973">SAVAGE</A></B> - 
   1973), but Chuck is so smitten he ignores Erik's warnings. Meanwhile, 
   Susie bones-up on her martial arts skills by having Rey's Master 
   teach her a new fighting technique using two wooden sticks. She also 
   begins following Chuck as he goes about his daily illegal routine, 
   but she is urged to stop following him by a police detective (Tony 
   Ferrer; Weng Weng's Chief in <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#ForYurHeightOnly">FOR
    Y'UR HEIGHT ONLY</A></B> - 1981), who tells Susie that Bonnie may 
   have disappeared because she uncovered information regarding Erik's 
   illegal drug business. This doesn't deter Susie from following Chuck 
   and she is eventually captured by Grip, who questions her using a 
   poisonous cobra as &quot;truth serum&quot;, but she escapes (and 
   throws the cobra in Grip's face!). After many close calls, where 
   Susie must fight numerous battles, the police discover Bonnie's 
   corpse and Susie inexplicably runs into Chuck's arms for comfort 
   (where, in a lovemaking scene directly from the Twilight Zone, he 
   cuts off all her clothes with knives and she reciprocates!). The 
   loving doesn't last very long, though, as Susie soon discovers that 
   Chuck killed Bonnie on Erik's orders (She seems to be the only one 
   who didn't know this fact!). Susie goes on a mission of revenge and, 
   before the film is done, she will face Chuck in the &quot;Arena of 
   Death&quot;, Erik's private martial arts tournament ring. This i<A HREF="naked_fist_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/naked fist dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>s
    not going to be pretty, as Rey and the police show up to deal with 
   Erik and his thugs while Susie deals with Chuck in the ring. Chuck 
   loses his life (and his eyes!) when Susie finally picks up her two 
   sticks and uses them as Rey's Master taught her.&nbsp; While nothing 
   more than a series of lively martial arts sequences held together by 
   the flimsiest of plots, <A HREF="firecracker_1981.htm"><B>FIRECRACKER</B></A> 
   (also known as <B><A HREF="naked_fist_1981.htm">NAKED FIST</A></B>) 
   moves along at a brisk pace and, at 77 minutes, is not long enough to 
   become repetitive. The beautiful Jillian Kesner, who died in 2007 of 
   a staph infection and was also the wife of late 
   cinematographer/director Gary Graver (she appeared in his <B><A HREF="gary graver.htm#TrickOrTreats1982">TRICK
    OR TREATS</A></B> [1982], <B><A HREF="moon_in_scorpio_1986.htm">MOON 
   IN SCORPIO</A></B> [1987] and several others), does a good job here 
   as the high-kicking heroine who manages to survive fight after fight 
   to get her revenge. Her standout scene comes when she fights two guys 
   in a lumber warehouse and keeps losing articles of her clothing until 
   she is topless, wearing nothing but panties. This is also the films 
   bloodiest sequence, as we witness a warehouse guard knocked to the 
   ground and impaled on a scythe, while one of the fighters purposely 
   steps on his body, forcing the blade to bloodily thrust out his chest 
   and one of the fighters falling head-first onto the spinning blade of 
   a circular saw until his skull is cut in half right between the eyes. 
   Chuck's death in the finale is (if you pardon the pun) also an 
   eye-opener. No one ever accused Cirio H. Santiago of making 
   high-concept, thought-provoking films, but, damn, he sure made 
   entertaining ones with plenty of eye candy. Santiago would remake the 
   same film a second time with 1992's <B><A HREF="action.htm#AngelFist">ANGELFIST</A></B>,
    starring Cat Sassoon in the role originated by Jeanne Bell in <B>TNT JACKSON</B>.

    OF DRAGON</A><A NAME="Fist Of Dragon"></A> (1977) -</B> Two 
   undercover female cops, nicknamed the &quot;Big Sisters&quot;, are 
   stirring up trouble in Chinatown, disrupting the business of the mob 
   kingpin known as the Big Boss. Big Sister #1 busts up gambling dens, 
   prostitution rackets and, in one unbelievable scene, beats the snot 
   out of two rapists who first fight each other over who will rape her 
   first. The townspeople catch the rapists and shove a wooden pole up 
   one rapist's ass and slice the pecker off the other one (thankfully, 
   offscreen). Big Sister #2 releases a hoarde of snakes into one of the 
   Big Boss' bathhouse/whorehouses, causing a bunch of naked women and 
   men to run out into the street. The Big Boss is anxious to find out 
   the true identities of the Big Sisters, so he hires two bumbling men 
   to follow them (they are so <A HREF="kung_fu_halloween_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/kung fu halloween ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="195" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>inept
    a blind man could spot them). The Big Sisters lead the two men and 
   some more goons to a zoo, where a big fight breaks out and the Big 
   Boss takes one of the Sisters prisoner. She convinces the Big Boss to 
   let her join his gang. With one Sister on the inside and the other on 
   the outside, they are able to destroy the Big Boss and his illegal 
   businesses once and for all. Sister on the inside bugs the Big Boss' 
   office and bedroom and learns all his intimate secrets. Problems 
   arise when the real Big Sister (I was just as surprised as you to 
   learn there was a real Big Sister!) appears on the scene, causing all 
   kinds of trouble for Big Sister on the inside. The real Big Sister 
   and the undercover Big Sister on the inside face off for a final 
   fight. The police arrive in the nick of time to save the day.&nbsp; 
   Believe it or not, most of this film is played as an outrageous 
   comedy. Released in the States under the misleading title <B><A HREF="kung_fu_halloween_1977.htm">KUNG
    FU HALLOWEEN</A></B> (a section of the film during the middle takes 
   place during a masquerade party, which results in a bunch of costumed 
   people to get in a lengthy fight), most of the humor fails miserably 
   or just seems wildly inappropriate. The scene where the rapist gets 
   his weiner lopped-off quickly cuts to a woman cleaving a link of 
   sausage in two and biting one of the pieces. Hardee-har-har! The 
   awful dubbing also doesn't help. When the Big Sister on the inside 
   sees that the Big Boss' girlfriend is getting jealous, she says, 
   &quot;I better go before that girlfriend of your's busts a gut.&quot; 
   Here's another charming chunk of dialogue: &quot;Stupid broad. She 
   thinks I'm stupid?&quot; It flows like pure Hemingway (not). There's 
   also plenty of lifted bad music, including an excruciating disco 
   rendition of &quot;Flight Of The Bumblebee&quot; in the opening 
   minutes. The martial arts fights are also sub-par, consisting of 
   badly-staged fist fights and numerous slow-motion shots of the Big 
   Sisters jumping through the air, courtesy of hidden trampolines. The 
   worst (and most unbelievable) part of the film is when Big Sister on 
   the inside tries to pass Big Sister on the outside as her brother 
   Peter, by simply dressing her in a man's leisure suit (she doesn't 
   even try to change her voice) and the Big Boss falls for it! There's 
   not much to recommend here except bad fights, crappy dialogue and 
   plenty of lowbrow humor. Directed by Lam Chi Kam and Liu Sun.

   adventures of Jason Blade (Edward John Stazak), agent for Hong Kong 
   Special Branch and member of the top secret martial arts society, 
   Temple of the Panthers. Picking up directly after the first film, <B><A HREF="#DayOfThePanther">DAY
    OF THE PANTHER</A></B> (filmed back-to-back with this) left off, (a 
   short synopsis, using footage from the first film, catches up new 
   viewers), Blade once again joins forces with his mentor, William 
   Anderson (John Stanton), to save Julia Summers (Fiona Gauntlett), the 
   daughter of a judge, from a Mob-run whorehouse. Using the name 
   &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;, Blade enters the brothel and saves Julia, but 
   not before having to beat the crap out of a bunch of Mob goons (When 
   Blade enters one of the brothel rooms and spots a guy in a chicken 
   suit about to do something kinky, he says, &quot;You're sick!&quot;). 
   Blade has an arguement with his girlfriend Gemma (Paris Jefferson), 
   William's niece, when she mentions moving in together (Gemma is now 
   an Interpol agent, but it still doesn't stop her from dancing in 
   front of Blade seductively in her leotards, just like she did in the 
   first <A HREF="fists_of_blood_1987b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/fists of blood vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>film
    when she was just a normal girl and not an agent). Blade's nemesis 
   from the first film, Jim Baxter (Jim Richards), escapes from prison 
   and has revenge on his mind. Two of his goons knock-out Blade, kidnap 
   Gemma and put William in the hospital when he tries to save her. 
   Blade promises William in the hospital that he will rescue Gemma and 
   then marry her. Baxter is holding Gemma captive in an abandoned power 
   plant and tells police that if Blade doesn't walk through the power 
   plant's doors by 6:00 PM, he will start cutting off Gemma's fingers. 
   Baxter has the power plant rigged with plastic explosives and holds a 
   remote that can trigger the explosion. Blade calls in Interpol 
   psychologist Lucy Andrews (Rowena Wallace) to act as negotiator to 
   buy Blade some time. Blade uses that time to capture the two goons 
   that kidnapped Gemma (Blade chases one of the goons up the outside 
   walls of an apartment complex, which results in a foot chase and the 
   goon dying when he gets hit by a car). After getting some valuable 
   info from the surviving goon, Blade enters the power plant and must 
   fight a gauntlet of hockey mask-wearing martial artists before he can 
   make his way to Baxter and Gemma (he also gets some psychic support 
   from William in his hospital bed). A team of commandos, led by Lucy, 
   also enter the power plant, but are picked-off one-by-one by the 
   stealthy assassins. The finale finds Lucy trying to diffuse the bomb 
   while Blade and Baxter have a duel to the death. Can Lucy stop the 
   ticking timebomb before everyone goes BOOM? What do you think?&nbsp;

   director Brian Trenchard-Smith (<B><A HREF="action.htm#ManFromHongKong">THE
    MAN FROM HONG KONG</A></B> - 1975; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#DeathCheaters">DEATH
    CHEATERS</A></B> - 1976; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#StuntRock">STUNT
    ROCK</A></B> - 1978) manages to milk a lot of action for the paltry 
   $500,000 budget. The cherub-faced Edward John Stazak is not much of 
   an actor (he improves slightly from the first film), but he's an 
   excellent martial artist, which makes me wonder why he quit films 
   after making this (that's right, this is the last Jason Blade 
   adventure, which is also known as <B><A HREF="fists_of_blood_1987.htm">STRIKE
    OF THE PANTHER</A></B>). I'm a firm believer that Trenchard-Smith, 
   working with a script by Peter West (who also scripted the first 
   film), is having a good laugh with the audience here, making us look 
   right and then hitting us with a left (although Paris Jefferson 
   spends most of her screen time in a sexy leotard, the only nudity in 
   this film is a shot of Stazak's naked ass when he's taking a 
   shower!). The final twenty minutes, where Blade and Lucy must run the 
   gauntlet in the power plant, is non-stop action, as people have their 
   throats cut, have their faces pierced by throwing stars, are inpaled 
   on swords or are just beaten or stabbed to death by Blade. Since both 
   Stazak and co-star Jim Richards&nbsp; are the film's Fight 
   Coordinators, the best fight scene is saved for last, where Blade and 
   Baxter square off. While the script has holes you could drive a truck 
   through (What's an abandoned power plant still doing with power?), <B><A HREF="fists_of_blood_1987b.htm">FISTS

   every film made, no matter how bad it is, deserves the chance to be

   slow motion camera was used to capture specific techniques.&quot;</B> 
   The film begins with an Oriental man carring a briefcase containing 
   something valuable. A multi-race street gang (containg everything 
   from Caucasians, Latinos and Blacks) steal the suitcase and kill the 
   Oriental guy by slamming his head violently against the sidewalk. We 
   then see martial arts master Jason (Owen Wat-s&oacute;n; who also 
   appeared in Fink's other film) meditating next to a fireplace when he 
   gets a call on his telephone (a tricked-out device the size of a 
   toaster oven with digital readouts and encased in red velvet!) by a 
   mysterious caller telling him he needs his help. The person on the 
   other end of the line says his courier was attacked and killed and a 
   valuable African artifact was stolen (An envelope is slid under 
   Jason's door with photographs of the artifact, along with a stack of 
   $100 bills. His door must have a wide gap at the bottom!). He wants 
   to hire Jason and his crew, which consists of Adam (Warhawk Tanzania; 
   whose only other film was the one he did for Barry Rosen the 
   following year), Eric (Malachi Lee; his only film) and Billy (Judie 
   Soriano; her only film), to retrieve the artifact. Jason agrees and 
   gathers his troops together and we get to witness each one of them 
   practice their own special brand of martial arts (an overlong and 
   boring sequence) before Jason brings him back to his place (he has an 
   automatic sliding door in the room with the fireplace!) and tells 
   them what they are hired to do. Eric takes a look at the photos and 
   identifies the four-armed artifact as a statue of a 
   &quot;Witchdoctor's Fetish&quot;, which is supposed to contain 
   mystical powers (Those of you waiting to see the statue at work will 
   be disappointed because this plot point is dropped immediately). They 
   then hit the streets looking for information on the stolen statue, 
   even going as far as to threaten bodily harm on innocent people (Eric 
   beats up a pimp when he has nothing to offer. He may be a pimp, but 
   why beat him up if he knows nothing?) This is another sequence that 
   goes on forever and nothing really happens besides getting a good 
   look at the streets and brownstones of mid-70's NYC and listening to 
   lots of post-synch dubbing. We then see the multi-racial gang (One of 
   them is portrayed by Wilfredo Roldan, who made a distinct impression 
   in <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DevilsExpress1975">DEVIL'S EXPRESS</A></B>,
    but he really doesn't have much to do here except get into a knife 
   fight with fellow gang member Juan [Frank Ruiz; who choreographed the 
   fight] and get the snot beat out of him every time he goes up against 
   Jason's quartet) hand over the briefcase to Mob head Z (Sam Schwartz; 
   his last acting credit) and when he opens it up and holds the statue, 
   Juan (who is sweating profusely from his sideburns) says, &quot;Man, 
   that is a spooky-looking thing!&quot;, to which Z replies, &quot;This 
   spooky-looking piece of wood is worth a lot of bread to all of us. 
   Let's call it our good luck charm.&quot; A hooker from the streets 
   enters the room and warns Z that the heat is on, because Jason and 
   his gang are asking a lot of questions and some people are getting 
   &quot;leaned on&quot; (We see Eric threatening a white guy on the 
   street and when he turns around, he is a priest standing in front of 
   his church! Wait a minute. Who are the good guys here?). Z needs some 
   time to trade the statue for some cold hard cash, so he tells his 
   gang to keep Jason and his gang busy until he is able to make the 
   trade. (Z says, &quot;Waste them all and waste them fast. If they're 
   roaming the streets, you can get them one at a time. I call that 
   pretty good odds!&quot;). Z is in for quite a surprise. Three gang 
   members attack Eric, but he makes mincemeat out of them in about 
   thirty seconds. Five gang members attack Billy at an outside 
   basketball court, but she knocks them all out in no time. Adam is the 
   next to be attacked (the first attacker rips off Adam's shirt, so we 
   can watch him fight bare-chested!), but he beats the crap out of 
   seven gang members. Judy beats-up a white guy stealing hubcaps and 
   threatens to kill him if he doesn't find out some information for her 
   (For stealing hubcaps? Who are the good guys here?). Jason is walking 
   down the street with a young boy (possibly a student at the martial 
   arts school Jason owns, but we never get to see it), when he is 
   attacked by six gang members, but I don't think I have to tell you 
   how it turns out. The four then gather at Jason's place to share 
   information, where Adam tells Eric, &quot;The streets are holding 
   back.&quot; (I would hold back, too, if they treated me the way they 
   treated the other people on the streets!) and Billy says, &quot;It 
   sounds like the Mob and the Mob with a capital 'Z'!&quot; Jason was 
   able to pry an address to where the statue is from one of the gang 
   members he beat up, so they all go there, where we witness one of the 
   lamest group martial arts fights ever committed to film (the walls of 
   the &quot;room&quot; are made of sheet rock!). After discovering that 
   the statue is not there, they decide to go to Z's mansion, where he 
   is holding a huge party for all his white friends (You can see some 
   of the party &quot;guests&quot; in the background staring directly at 
   the camera). Z meets bad girl Felicia (Sydney Filson; a black belt 
   whose only credits are in both of Fink's films) and offers the statue 
   to her, but says the price has gone up $100,000 more because of 
   &quot;inflation&quot; and all the trouble it has caused him (We then 
   watch a truly awful band, called &quot;Life U.S.A.&quot; [who also 
   supply other songs on the soundtrack], which contains some Black 
   people, singing a terrible early disco tune at the party, while the 
   white people boogie down!). They both go to the poolhouse to look at

   her house. Z is alerted that Jason and his friends are in the woods 
   next to his mansion, so he sends a shitload of gang members (they 
   seem to multiply like rabbits!) to take care of the problem. The 
   ensuing fight is full of missed kicks and punches and one gang member 
   falls down prematurely so he doesn't run into the camera! Jason and 
   his friends meet Z in the poolhouse, but make it seem like he got 
   away, because they want to get Felicia's money and the statue at the 
   same time (all the white people scatter and scream when they see four 
   Black people chasing Z!). Adam places a tracking device on Z's car We 
   never see the device or the receiver, only a beeping on the 
   soundtrack!) so they can follow him in the morning, where they all 
   end up at Felicia's house and another group martial arts fight breaks 
   out. After Billy beats Felicia in a fight and Z and the gang are all 
   knocked out, Jason and<A HREF="force_four_1974_the_guy_from_harlem_1976_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/force four-the guy from harlem dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="279" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A> 
   his gang collect the briefcase and the money. When the briefcase is 
   opened, Eric discovers that the Witchdoctor's Fetish is not worth all 
   that money and there must be another reason why all this money is 
   exchanging hands. Sure enough, hidden inside the briefcase is a 
   fortune in heroin, so Eric says he will dump it so it doesn't hit the 
   streets, they will betray the mystery caller that Jason had in the 
   beginning of the film and they will keep the money for themselves 
   (Who are the good guys here?). At this point the film runs 70 minutes 
   long, so to pad out the film, they repeat every fight scene that was 
   in the film! The closing credits run for nearly five minutes (where 
   we discover that everyone besides Sam Schwartz and a few other people 
   hold some color martial arts belt) before the film mercifully 
   ends.&nbsp; It's not hard to see why director Michael Fink only made 
   one more film and then hung up his shingle. The screenplay, by 
   Leonard Michaels and Janice Weber, holds no place for nudity of any 
   kind and the film itself seems improvised in most of the non-fighting 
   scenes (both Owen Wat-s&oacute;n and Warhawk Tanzania are credited as 
   the Martial Arts Fight choreographers), as well as displaying our old 
   friend &quot;Boom Mike&quot; is several sequences (pay attention to 
   the left side of the screen when Jason and his friends go back to 
   Jason's place), a lot of post-synch dubbing (most of the outdoor 
   scenes are filmed MOS and were looped after the film was finished), 
   some truly wretched fight scenes with exaggerated sound effects 
   (there are so many missed kicks and punches, it looks like the wind 
   knocked them down), plenty of racial slurs (even though Z's gang is 
   multi-racial), extremely bad original songs on the soundtrack and 
   worst of all, there are no guns on display. What Don in his right 
   mind would not have a gang that was strapped? I guess Michael Fink 
   couldn't afford guns or bloody bullet squibs for the film (the only 
   blood we see is when the Oriental guy's bloody head is on the 
   sidewalk). To paraphrase Billy, this film is bad with a capital Z.

   discovers that Tori is one of the featured topless dancers. A romance 
   develops between Luke and Tori, while Pep teaches him fighting 
   strategy taken directly from Sun Tzu's &quot;The Art Of War&quot; and 
   Tori teaches him ballet to make him more flexible (Insert your own 
   dirty joke here). Luke spots a bum wearing his brother's jacket and 
   the only thing the bum is able to tell him about his brother's killer 
   is he is known as &quot;The Cobra&quot;. It becomes apparent that The 
   Cobra doesn't want to be found out (although eagle-eyed viewers 
   should be able to spot the killer during Johnny's murder in the 
   beginning of the film), so Luke enters an alley tournament and begins 
   asking about The Cobra. He gets very few answers (One fighter says, 
   &quot;Yeah, I got a cobra...in my pants!&quot;), but Luke begins 
   moving up the ranks (as does Albert, who is also in the competition) 
   in contention for the $5,000 grand prize (It doesn't seem worth it, 
   does it?). When Luke finally gets a lead on The Cobra and the 
   informant ends up dead before passing the info to him, it's clear 
   that The Cobra is closer to Luke than he knows. After Albert becomes 
   permanently paralyzed during a brutal tournament fight, Luke must 
   fight Ahmed (Joe Charles), the same beefy fighter that put Albert in 
   the hospital. Tori discovers an important clue about The Cobra at the 
   hospital, but can she relay it to Luke before it's too late?&nbsp;

   possible. Pep's training of Luke is full of strange methods, 
   including making Luke try to outrun a bus across a city block (it 
   becomes a daily showdown between Luke and the bus driver and is quite 
   funny), as well as having neighborhood kids throw dozens of rotten 
   tomatoes at Luke to sharpen his reflexes. Jacobson also films the 
   fight scenes in a lively manner, using Trimble's high-kicking ability 
   to good effect (sometimes using slow-motion photography to allow the 
   viewer to appreciate how fast Trimble really is with his feet). The 
   final fight between Luke and The Cobra, where they fight each other 
   to the death while quoting passages from &quot;The Art Of War&quot;, 
   is a thing of unexpected beauty that ends with a nasty 
   pipe-through-the-stomach gag (complete with blood pouring out of the

   of nudity (mostly by Denise Buick), lots of blood and a good sense of 
   humor. Also starring Alvin Pounder, Howard Jackson, Manuel Luben,

   this semi-sequel to <B><A HREF="#NinjaTerminator1986">NINJA TERMINATOR</A></B> 
   (this film begins with a shortened version of NT's climatic battle 
   and is Richard Harrison's only appearance in the film, even if he 
   does get star billing), the good Golden Ninjas fight the evil Red 
   Ninjas for possession of the Golden Ninja Warrior statue, which is 
   said to give it's owner the &quot;ultimate&quot; power (whatever that 
   is). Well, the Golden Ninjas are now the proud owners of the statue, 
   but the Red Ninjas will never give up their quest to possess it. In 
   case you're a newbie to this genre, this is another cut-and-paste 
   flick that is not only produced by Joseph Lai (for his IFD Films &amp;
    Arts Ltd. production outfit), he also wrote and directed this one, 
   too (This one is Godfrey Ho-free, although it reeks of his 
   handiwork). The old footage (an unreleased Hong Kong crime drama) is 
   about a young model named Sherri (Queenie Yang), who travels to Hong 
   Kong to avenge the death of her father at the hands of crime kingpins 
   Eagle Lam and Eric Tan. Sherri goes undercover as a virgin prostitute 
   (!) to infiltrate one of Eagle Lam's brothels (where we earlier 
   witnessed a goon mercilessly whipping a <A HREF="golden_ninja_warrior_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/golden ninja warrior german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>tied-up,
    totally nude young woman for refusing to put out), where she uses 
   her expert kung-fu skills to free all the female captives forced into 
   prostitution and beats the crap out of all the males that work there 
   (in the newly-shot footage, some masked woman in a black ninja outfit 
   [I'm not sure whether it's supposed to be Sherri or not. If so, she's 
   one quick-change artist!] slugs it out with some other guys in 
   badly-matched shots that are supposed to take place in the same 
   building that Sherri is in). Sherri begins dismantling Eagle's crime 
   organization piece-by-piece (including stealing incriminating 
   documents out of his safe), much to Eagle's dismay. Every twenty 
   minutes or so, a woman in a red ninja outfit attacks Michael Anderson 
   (Donald Owen), who turns into a black-clad Golden Ninja in a puff of 
   smoke, and they fight each other using swords and their fists, all 
   over possession of the Golden Ninja Warrior statue. Sherri falls in 
   love with a young newspaper reporter named Dick, who grows more 
   suspicious of her reasons for being in Hong Kong as the film 
   progresses. As Sherri begins decimating Eagle's goons, Eagle hires a 
   female assassin named Sakura (Morna Lee) to capture Sherri. Sakura 
   does indeed capture Sherri and Eagle beats and rapes Sherri in his 
   bedroom while her hands are tied behind her back. Dick rescues her 
   and then Sherri goes on a final revenge spree, killing Eagle, his 
   crime partner Eric and Sakura with Michael and Dick's help.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="golden_ninja_warrior_1986b.htm">GOLDEN
    NINJA WARRIOR</A></B> is extremely hard to follow, but, for the most 
   part, holds the viewer's interest thanks to some crazy fight 
   sequences and tons of female nudity, most of it the full-frontal 
   kind, which is highly unusual in these Joseph Lai pastiche films. 
   Truly head-scratching are some of Sherri's fight sequences, which Lai 
   intercuts with scenes of the black-clad female ninja fighting on what 
   are supposed to be the same sets that Sherri is on, but it's quite 
   obvious to the viewer that most of the sets don't match. As with all 
   of Lai's cut-and-paste flicks, the English dubbing is hilarious, such 
   as when Sherri bursts into Eagle's home (dressed in short-shorts, a 
   revealing top and matching headband) and he says to her, &quot;Who 
   are you?&quot; Her reply of &quot;I am the Death Fairy!&quot; is sure 
   to elicit laughs rather than strike fear into the heart of her enemy. 
   Here's another one: <B>Dick:</B> &quot;I'm a reporter.&quot; <B>Goon:</B> 
   &quot;I don't care if you're Robert Redford!&quot; (It's probably an 
   obscure reference to <B><A HREF="all_the_presidents_men_1976.htm">ALL 
   THE PRESIDENT'S MEN</A></B> [1976], but, c'mon, who is going to get 
   it?). The whipping scene in the beginning and Sherri's rape later in 
   the film go way beyond the boundaries of good taste (they're 
   downright cruel in their execution) and Sakura's arsenal of weapons, 
   including motion-sensing throwing knives (You've gotta see them to 
   believe them!) and throwing stars equipped with garrotte wires, are 
   highlights of this crazy film. Although the newly-shot insert scenes 
   are quite noticeable, it's also obvious that Lai did try this time to 
   match background shots, especially the final climatic battle among a 
   bunch of abandoned multi-colored disc-shaped modular homes. Lai 
   failed for the most part, but at least an effort was made, something 
   that's severely lacking in most of these films. The Golden Ninjas

   Korea/Taiwan/Thailand co-production titled <B><A HREF="great_escape_in_jungle_1985.htm">GREAT
    ESCAPE IN JUNGLE</A></B> - 1985) with newly-shot footage of 
   Caucasian actors awkwardly edited in. This film opens up with three 
   ninjas, dressed in pink and white ninja outfits (with black headbands 
   with the word &quot;Ninja&quot; written on them), killing two white 
   dudes and stealing their treasure map, which shows the location of 
   gold hidden by the Japanese during World War II. It's located in 
   Devil's Cave, which happens to be in Willie's territory (it sounds 
   scary). The head pink ninja, Baron (Mike Abbott), goes to Willie to 
   work out a deal (in a badly-edited segment of old and new footage). 
   Meanwhile, a bunch of women escape from Willie's territory and are 
   hunted down by his men. They manage to kill three women and capture 
   the rest, except for Jennie, who is saved by adventurer Chester 
   (Sorapong Chatri; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#EyesOfTheCondor">EYES

    gratitude, she offers to become partners with Chester and lead him 
   to the gold. One of the dying women tells an Army colonel (Richard 
   Harrison) about the gold and how Baron and his ninjas will have to 
   pass through this area to get to it. The colonel and his men set up 
   ambush points (and boobytraps) and wait for Baron and his men. 
   Jennie, her friends David, Jack and Chester (who has a score to 
   settle with Willie, since he is responsible for his sister's death) 
   begin their trek through the jungle and must contend with numerous 
   attacks by Willie's men, a very hungry tiger and various other jungle 
   pitfalls. Chester finds a friend in jungle woman Jane, who wears a 
   loincloth, swings from vines and controls animals. Jennie, Jack and 
   David are captured by Willie, who rapes Jennie in his bedroom by 
   gunpoint after forcing her to smoke a cigarette laced with a 
   halucinogenic drug. Carter tries to save them, but he, too, is 
   captured. Jane saves them all (David says, &quot;She dresses like 
   Tarzan, but she fights like King Kong!&quot;) and they continue on 
   their treasure hunt. The colonel and his men (who, for some reason, 
   are now dressed in camoflauge ninja outfits with red &quot;Ninja&quot;
    headbands!) begin their fight against Baron and his men, who come 
   armed with crossbows (with explosive bolts) and shotguns. Chester and 
   his group save a bunch of women from a cannibal tribe and continue on 
   their way to Devil's Cave, not aware that Willie and his men are 
   already there and the cave is very unstable (everyone but Willie 
   leaves their guns outside so they don't cause a cave-in). The 
   conclusion finds Chester's group fighting Willie's group, while the 
   colonel goes mano-a-mano against Baron. Willie is the first to find 
   the treasure, but the idiot fires his gun and the roof comes falling 
   in on him. The Colonel and Baron duel to the death with swords and 
   the Colonel defeats Baron with a well-placed yellow smoke ball

   this one for producers Joseph Lai and Betty Chan's IFD Films And Arts 
   Ltd. production company), <B>HANDS OF DEATH</B> is one of the better 
   ones, thanks to a plot that's not confusing and the non-stop action.

   comparison to the older footage, which offers plenty of martial arts

   help of her old blind uncle (&quot;As you can see I am blind, but I'm 
   not stupid!&quot;), must fight members of the Chinese mafia every ten 
   minutes or so. In the new footage, white ninja Wilbur battles black 
   ninja Steve for some reason or another every 30 minutes or so and 
   then disappear (poof!) in a puff of smoke. There's a slight 
   supernatural angle to the Hong Kong plot (involving a woman, the 
   leader of the Chinese mafia, who wears a black mask and robe and 
   travels from house-to-house with her devoted followers, killing 
   everyone in sight), but nothing makes much sense. It's not boring, 
   though, as people are shot, stabbed, have throwing stars embedded in 
   their skulls, women are raped, Brian picks up the back end of a 
   running car with his bare hands, cars explode and people are beaten 
   to a bloody pulp. The film is also full of laugh-out-loud scenes, as 
   where white ninja Wilbur uses a cordless phone as a walkie talkie 
   (there's a photo of it on the <A HREF="instant_rage_1988.htm">back of 
   of the VHS box</A>); a catfight between two girls over Brian, where 
   one girl says to the other; &quot;I'll tell you one thing, I'm great 
   in bed!&quot;; a really slow chase between an injured man and a 
   bulldozer which results in the man being gored to death by the 
   bulldozer's blade; a gunfight between the police and members of the 
   mafia in a quarry where they are no more than ten feet from each 
   other; a scene between Wilbur and a police captain where it's plain 
   to see they are in two different locations (the backgrounds don't 
   match) even though they're supposed to be in the same room; and, 
   anytime ninjas fly through the air and land on balconies or the top 
   of walls, it's obvious the film is running in reverse. I haven't even 
   touched on the scene where Brian is stripped to his red bikini briefs 
   and tortured with snakes or when a girl is attacked in the shower by 
   the female Mafia chieftan with a fencing sword. The final ninja fight 
   between Wilbur and Steve involves swords, a rolling bale of hay and 
   explosions, but makes absolutely no sense and ends rather quickly. <B>INSTANT
    RAGE</B> is non-stop action from the minute it starts, but if you 
   like a coherent plot (or any plot) to go along with your kicks and 
   gunshots, look elsewhere. I did chuckle, though, when one cop says, 
   &quot;Hey, I got one!&quot; after shooting a bad guy in the final 
   battle. Proceed at your own risk. Starring Elton Gibbs, Max Hill, 
   Jack Fox, Ruby Clay, Norman Luddy, Jerry Jones, Paul Gould, Derry

    INSTRUCTOR</A><A NAME="Instructor"></A> (1981) -</B> Wow. Simply 
   wow. Revel in the badness of this regional (made in Ohio and 
   Colorado) martial arts actioner, where the majority of men sport 70's 
   porno-style moustaches and everyone knows karate. The film opens with 
   the Instructor (Bob Chaney) and student Thumper (director Don 
   Bendell) breaking up a rape by an overage street gang. Thumper gets 
   knocked out, but the Instructor defeats the dozen gang members 
   single-handedly (lots of crotch grabbing) in one of the most 
   awkwardly-staged and hilarious fights in recent memory (I 
   particularly liked how he kicked one female gang member in the 
   stomach and, as she stands bent-over in pain, he grabs her by hair 
   and finishes her off with a punch to the face). The film then settles 
   in to the major storyline. The Instructor runs a karate school where 
   he teaches discipline over fighting. His rival is Bud Hart (Bob 
   Saal), who owns a karate school across town and only teaches 
   fighting, <A HREF="instructor_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/instructor vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>discipline
    be damned. He is nothing but a bully that turns out nothing but 
   thugs and is also responsible for the Instructor's wife's death, 
   although there is no evidence to prove it. Bud sends four of his men 
   to the Instructor's school late one night to destroy it, but Dee 
   (Lynday Scharnoff), one of the school's teachers, is there. They try 
   to rape her, but she fights them off (she jabs a pencil into one 
   guy's armpit). Bud is also in cahoots with a crooked union boss and 
   he kidnaps a rival union leader for supplying &quot;scabs&quot; to a 
   work site (this plot line leads nowhere). At a local karate 
   tournament, where the Instructor and Bud's student fight for 
   trophies, Thumper is seriously injured in the locker room by a 
   retarded man stealing a trophy (&quot;I'll mangle you, you 
   turd!&quot;). The Instructor snaps, thinking Bud is involved (he 
   isn't), and goes looking for revenge. He ends up fighting half the 
   punks in town and then gets into a car chase with Bud (his Corvette 
   vs. Bud's Camaro), which turns into a motorcycle chase (!) and then 
   turns into a fight in a river which climaxes in a duel in the woods, 
   where a chainsaw and an axe is used. After Bud is accidentally 
   killed, the police arrest the Instructor, where he eventually gets 
   fined $500 and gets off with a suspended sentence. Hooray for our 
   legal system!&nbsp; Director/producer/scripter Don Bendell (who never 
   made anything else) has the advantage of using real black belts in 
   the starring roles but, unfortunately, none of them can act their way 
   out of a paper bag. Still, the film is entertaining in a car-wreck 
   kind of way (it's bad and you still can't take your eyes off it), as 
   Bendell uses every filmic trick in the book, from slow-motion kicks 
   and falls, POV shots, car chases and crashes, to the climatic fight 
   with a chainsaw. The creepiest aspect of this film is the retarded 
   guy, who we first see stalking kids playing in the park, dressed in a 
   black ninja uniform (we see him pick his nose under the mask) and 
   brandishing a knife. As I said before, everyone in town knows karate, 
   so the kids beat the stuffing out of him. So what does the Instructor 
   do? He lets the retard become a student at his school! Another 
   strange aspect is that Bob Chaney's character is never given a proper 
   name. He is only referred to as &quot;Instructor&quot;, 
   &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;karate guy&quot;. It plain to see that it's 
   done purposely in the screenplay, as in the prison scene in the 
   finale where great care is taken not saying his name by the cops, the 
   jailer or Dee. It's as if Bendell wanted to create some mythical 
   character in the vein of Clint Eastwood's &quot;Man With No 
   Name&quot;. But Chaney's short stature, thick moustache and curly 
   black perm will elicit nothing but laughs. Don Bendell has, on the 
   other hand, created something that, once seen, you're not likely to 
   ever forget. What more could you ask for? Made by martial artists 
   using what God gave them: Big moustaches and no wires or stunts that 
   defy gravity. Also starring Bruce Bendell, Shirley Bendell (nepotism 
   alert!), Tom Atha, Tony Blanchard and Jack Holderbaum. A <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Vestron Video">Vestron

   visit his absentee father, Paul (Jared Martin; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Quiet Cool">QUIET

   ride from a talkative taxi driver (Have you ever eaten fried

   clap!&quot;), Anthony is dropped off on the bad side of town, where 
   he is instantly beaten-up and robbed by three street punks. He then 
   takes a long bus ride to the town of Los Banos, where he has an 
   awkward reunion with his father (&quot;How's your Mom?&quot; 
   &quot;She's got a rich New York lawyer that she sees on 
   weekends!&quot;) and then meets a beautiful local girl named Maria 
   (Jannelle Barretto). After fixing a broken motorcycle in his father's 
   garage, Anthony takes a ride around town and spots a goon named Quino 
   (Enrico Torralba) shaking down Maria's parents in their store. Maria 
   explains to Anthony that Quino heads a protection racket and since 
   he's the town's karate champion, you either pay up or get the shit 
   kicked out of you. Anthony, who doesn't know the difference between 
   karate and his asshole, quickly gets on Quino's bad side when he 
   kicks him in the nuts at a local karate tournament (The old &quot;blin<A HREF="karate_warrior_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/karate warrior vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>d

   trick!) and then leads Quino and his goons on a motorcycle chase, 
   where Anthony proves quite proficient on two wheels. Quino retaliates 
   the next day by kidnapping Anthony and beating him within an inch of 
   his life, leaving him to die in the jungle. While Paul and Maria 
   search for Anthony, he is rescued by Master Kimura (Ken Watanabe; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#NinjaWarriors">NINJA
    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1985), Quino's former martial arts teacher who 
   disappeared four years ago in disgrace after finding out that Quino 
   went to the dark side. Master Kimura agrees to teach Anthony karate 
   if he agrees to face-off with Quino at the annual &quot;Kimura 
   Tournament&quot;, which Quino has won for the past four years. I 
   think we can all see where this is heading. Master Kimura has ten 
   days (!) to teach Anthony everything he knows (Forget &quot;wax on, 
   wax off&quot;, there's no time for that!), including the incredible 
   &quot;Dragon Blow&quot; technique, a way of incapacitating a person 
   without actually touching them. Anthony's mother, Julia (Janet Agren; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Panic 1976">PANIC</A></B> 
   - 1982), makes the trip from America to join Paul and Maria as they 
   watch Anthony take on Quino for the $2,000 grand prize (that's right, 
   $2,000!) at the Kimura Tournament in the film's finale, where 
   Anthony, blinded by Quino's constant illegal blows to his face, gets 
   to use the Dragon Blow on Quino while blindfolded. Hooray for 
   karate!&nbsp; Where do I begin to describe how truly pathetic this 
   film really is? For one, Kim Stuart (the son of late Italian actor 
   Giacomo Rossi-Stuart [<B><A HREF="war_between_the_planets_1966.htm">WAR
    BETWEEN THE PLANETS</A></B> - 1966; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CrimesBlackCat">CRIMES
    OF THE BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1972]) is a terrible actor and is so 
   skinny, I was afraid he would slip through the slats in the floor. He 
   is to karate what Carrot Top is to comedy. In other words, he just 
   doesn't cut it. Director Fabrizio De Angelis (<B><A HREF="thunder_warrior_series_1983-1988.htm">THUNDER
    WARRIOR</A></B> - 1983; <B><A HREF="action.htm#DeadlyImpact">DEADLY IMPACT</A></B> 
   - 1984; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ManHunt1984">MAN HUNT</A></B> - 1984), 
   using his frequent pseudonym &quot;Larry Ludman&quot;, has fashioned 
   a film so devoid of characters to care about, I fail to see the point 
   in making this film for any other reason than to capitalize on the 
   popularity of <B>THE KARATE KID</B>. The script, by De Angelis and 
   Dardano Sacchetti (using the name &quot;David Parker Jr.), makes 
   Anthony look like a wise-cracking asshole who deserves whatever 
   punishment is given him (he really is a jerk); his father is nothing 
   but a self-confessed coward who left his son and wife when things got 
   too complicated back in the States; his mother is a control freak and 
   Maria nothing but a generic damsel in distress. They all lack even 
   the basest of human emotions, which makes the whole film seem like it 
   is being acted by a bunch of robots. The violence never rises above a 
   PG level and the martial arts sequences are badly choreographed. The 
   final face-off between Anthony and Quino is anti-climatic and is all 
   over in less than a minute. It really is about as lame as they come. 
   The only fun to be had here is counting the flubbed lines, monotone 
   delivery and white belt machinations by Kim Stuart, who looks like he 
   would have trouble opening a box of cereal, nevermind winning a 
   karate tournament. The scene where he knocks out an ox using the 
   Dragon Blow is a thing of unintentional hilarity (This being an 
   Italian film, I have to wonder what means they used to get the poor 
   ox to fall to it's knees. It wouldn't surprise me it it was fatal.).

   Filipino martial arts revenge actioner with a cast of familiar faces. 
   When champion martial artist Billy Edwards (Sean Donahue; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Savage Instinct">SAVAGE
    INSTINCT</A></B> - 1989; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Parole Violators">PAROLE

   Judith (Michelle Locke) after her shift is over, she decides to walk 
   home and is assaulted and nearly raped by Tony (Greg Douglass; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#FistOfSteel1991">FIST
    OF STEEL</A></B> - 1991) and a couple of doo-rag-wearing street 
   thugs (one of them portrayed by Filipino film staple Jim Gaines). 
   Billy arrives in the nick of time to prevent the rape and beats the 
   crap out of Tony and the other two creeps. Tony's brother Russell 
   (Ned Hourani; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#DuneWarriors">DUNE WARRIORS</A></B> 
   - 1990), a crooked street fight promoter (Is there any other kind?), 
   watches Billy beating the stuffing out of his brother and sees 
   dollars signs. Russell drives Billy and his seriously injured sister 
   to the hospital (Billy doesn't know Russell and Tony are brothers) 
   and offers to pay Judith's extensive medical bills if Billy will 
   fight for him. Billy accepts and soon he is fighting in a series of 
   high stakes back alley fights where there are no rules. Billy's new 
   trainer, Murphy (Jerry Bayer), works him hard and a real friendship 
   builds between them. Billy's best friend, David (Loren Avedon; <B><A HREF="no_retreat_no_surrender_2_1988.htm">NO

    for him. Still unaware that Russell is Tony's brother, Billy goes on 
   the hunt for Judith's attackers. Russell is, of course, pissed off 
   and orders his men to kill Billy, which they do, by beating him up, 
   dragging him behind two cars (with each arm tied to a separate car!) 
   and slamming him face-first into a third car. In what will probably 
   have most viewers doing a double take, Billy comes to David in a 
   vision (complete with swirling fog!) and tells him that he must 
   avenge his death and Judith's blindness, caused by the beat-down she 
   took during the attempted rape (When David goes to the morgue to 
   identify Billy's body, he pukes his guts out when he views Billy's 
   mashed-up face!). David begins his revenge spree by seducing Tony's 
   girlfriend, Joyce (Santi Jordana), and pumping her (so to speak) for 
   information on Russell's enterprises. He begins to (awkwardly) 
   dismantle Russell's operation, but first he needs heavy training from 
   Murphy, who whips him into shape (in true 80's montage fashion, even 
   if this is a 90's film) for the inevitable showdown with Russell, who 
   has never been beaten in a fight.&nbsp; This unrelated sequel to <B><A HREF="king_of_the_kickboxers_1990.htm">KING
    OF THE KICKBOXERS</A></B> (1990; also starring Loren Avedon) is one 
   of the most badly acted martial arts actioners I have seen in quite a 
   while (It's no coincidence that this is Michelle Locke's only film 
   credit; she's simply cringe-worthy as Judith), but director John 
   Lloyd (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#NinjaWarriors">NINJA WARRIORS</A></B> 
   - 1984; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#NinjasForce2">NINJA'S FORCE II</A></B> 
   - 1986) and screenwriter Rod Davis offer so many outrageous moments 
   and choice bits of dialogue, that it's impossible not to be 
   entertained. The insanity begins immediately when the film starts, as 
   we watch (an uncredited) Mike Monty portray a drunk who refuses to 
   leave Judith's bar and demands more beer by saying, &quot;All you 
   women, you're all the same. Just a bunch of nagging bitches, just 
   like my old sea hag!&quot; and then the film goes on to display a 
   series of bloody martial arts fights that are lively in their 
   execution, but what comes between those fights will have you shaking 
   your head like one of those toy dogs you see in the back of Mexicans' 
   cars (It's a joke people! Quit being so sensitive.). Billy's death 
   took me completely by surprise, but when he appears to David in a 
   vision after shuffling off into the Great Beyond, the film quits 
   being a standard martial arts flick and crosses over into surreal 
   territory. The film also crosses over into <B><A HREF="cape_fear_1991.htm">CAPE
    FEAR</A></B> (the 1991 remake) territory in detailing Tony's 
   obsession with the now-blind Judith, even going as far as to have him 
   hitch a ride on the undercarriage of David's Jeep to find her. The 
   scene where Tony traps her in a swimming pool is one of the funniest 
   things I have seen in a long time, thanks to Ms. Locke's horrible 
   emoting and Tony's dialogue (When Tony says to Judith, &quot;I just 
   want you to know, you are going to die, but I thought I might POP! 
   one of your eyeballs out and skull-fuck you first!&quot;, I was 
   laughing so hard, I nearly shit my pants!). <B><A HREF="king_of_the_kickboxers_2_1992b.htm">KING

   the ominous-sounding &quot;White Wolf Hill&quot;.&nbsp; As far as 
   Chinese martial arts flicks go, <B>MACHO MAN</B> is nothing but 
   ordinary. Typical of many 70's kung fu films, this one has minimal 
   plot and lots and lots of fights. Unfortunately, none of the fights 
   are very exciting (although the final fight, where our hero coats his 
   arms with his own blood so his opponent can't get a grip, is somewhat 
   original). The real problem with this film is that the same sound 
   effect is used for every punch, kick and block. It almost becomes 
   comical listening to every fight. Almost. What's even funnier is the 
   totally bogus VHS box art, synopsis and credits on the Master Arts 
   Video clamshell case. Not only do the artwork and photos on the 
   clamshell have nothing to do with the film, the synopsis is totally 
   made up (it could describe hundreds of martial arts films, but not 
   this one) and the credits are a total sham (although I did get a 
   chuckle out of &quot;Enyan Liew&quot; and &quot;Jerry Rages&quot; as 
   the stars of the film). As with most films of this type, the dubbing 
   is horrendous (everyone yells, &quot;Goddamn you!&quot; when they get 
   hit) and the scope frame is severely compromised by the fullscreen 
   presentation (it is pan-and-scan, but the telecine operator has a 
   hard time keeping up with the action). Not worth your time unless you 
   have to see every martial arts film in existance. Directed by Yu Ming 
   Ho and starring Hui Tin, Yee Jan and Lo Lun. The always reliable <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</A>

    CONNECTION</A><A NAME="MiamiConnection86"></A> (1986) -</B> If 
   Godfrey Ho made a film in Orlando, Florida, it would turn out like 
   this: Cheap, amateurish, badly edited and totally entertaining in a 
   retarded sort of way. It also found a new life as a cult film thanks 
   to Drafthouse Films and even got a lengthy write-up in Entertainment 
   Weekly. It's easy to see why. It has spurts of gore, lots of fight 
   scenes, mullets, music that could have only come from the 80's and 
   loads of unintentional comedy. Here's the story in a nutshell: Five 
   college students by day, Mark (Y.K. Kim, who also co-wrote the story 
   and directed the re-shot ending), John (Vincent Hirsch), Jack (Joseph 
   Diamond, who wrote the screenplay), Jim (Maurice Smith) and Tom 
   (Angelo Janotti), are also in a New Wave rock band called Dragon 
   Sound with female singer Jane (Kathy Collier), who is also John's 
   love interest. They are the new house band in a nightclub and are 
   also expert martial artists. This brings up the ire of Jane's brother 
   Jeff (William Ergle), who is a drug dealer and doesn't want his 
   sister dating John because he is too straight-laced and poses a 
   danger to his drug business. Jeff is in league with Yashito (Si. Y. 
   Jo), who is the leader of a motorcycle-riding ninja gang (!) that 
   rips off and kills other drug dealers (as we witness in the beginning 
   of the film). All of the male members of Dragon Sound are orphans 
   except for token black member Jim, whose father was stationed in 
   Korea <A HREF="miami_connection_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/miami connection poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    married a Korean woman, resulting in Jim being born. His father left 
   Korea, Jim's mother died and Jim has been searching for him ever 
   since (His crying jag about looking for his father is one of the 
   film's hilarious highlights). The old house band of the nightclub 
   doesn't take too kindly to being replaced, so they try to beat the 
   snot out of Dragon Sound (they first try to beat-up the club's owner, 
   but he is also a martial artist!), only to end up with broken noses 
   and fractured arms. The injured old house band enlist the help of 
   Jeff and his gang, who kidnap Tom, beat him up and tie him to a 
   pillar in an abandoned factory. The rest of Dragon Sound rescue Tom, 
   which results in the death of Jeff (Jane forgives John for his death 
   almost immediately!). Jim finally locates his father, so the rest of 
   the band chip in, buy him a suit and a plane ticket to meet Daddy. On 
   their way to the airport, Mark, Jim and John are attacked by Yashito 
   and his black-clad ninjas (Yashito wears a white ninja outfit). Jim 
   is seriously wounded when he is sliced in the chest with a sword, but 
   Mark and John defeat the ninjas and Mark has a final confrontation 
   with Yashito, resulting in Yashito being stabbed to death with his 
   own knife. Mark and John rush Jim to the hospital, where he survives 
   his wounds and is met by his father, who tells him that he loves him 
   and will never leave him again. The balance of nature is once again 
   at one with peace.&nbsp; Originally, Jim died at the end, but 
   according to the supplements on the Blu-Ray, nobody would buy the 
   film with that ending, so more than a year later they resot the 
   ending with Jim surviving and finally meeting his father. Director 
   Richard W. Park (Real name: Woo-sang Park; He also directed the 
   &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; films <B><A HREF="la_streetfighters_1985.htm">L.A.

    CHINATOWN</A></B> [1996], but they don't match this film in sheer 
   weirdness), who also plays the owner of a restaurant that Dragon 
   Sound frequents (he also has his own martial arts fight with a gang 
   of ruffians), works with what he has. Namely, an amateur cast that 
   delivers their dialogue with mind-numbing hilarity (Only Y.K. Kim and 
   Vincent Hirsch were real-life martial artists and Kim struggles with 
   the English dialogue [He speaks it much more fluently on the recently 
   shot documentary supplement]). According to Angelo Janotti in the 
   documentary (He and Kathy Collier were the only real musicians in the 
   film [it's a hoot watching Y.K. Kim fake playing the bass] and wrote 
   and sang the film's most memorable songs), much of the dialogue was 
   improvised, but director Park filmed many takes of each scene and 
   Hirsch kept on stealing Janotti's jokes on the second take, forcing 
   him to come up with something else off the cuff. There's some bloody 
   gore on view, including blood spurting out of a neck wound and 
   Yashito decapitating one of his own ninjas for failing to kill Mark 
   and John and plenty of martial arts fights (some in slow motion) 
   which, I must say, were filmed very well. According to Hirsch, they 
   really punched and kicked each other to add to the realism! There's 
   also some female nudity on view, such as when Yashito and his biker 
   ninjas join some other biker gang and their women lift up their tops 
   to expose their breasts. I can see why this is considered a cult 
   item. It runs a scant 83 minutes, so it doesn't outstay its welcome 
   and the music and dialogue are so goofy, you can't help but have a 
   good time. This is the type of film better watched with an audience, 
   but it is perfectly fine to view on your own. This gets my CritCon

    THUNDERBOLT</A></B>) cut-and-paste martial arts actioners, featuring 
   newly-shot footage of Caucasian actors slugging it out, spliced into 
   an unreleased Hong Kong, Indonesian or Filipino action film, making 
   the end product some surreal bastardization of logic. The film opens 
   with Dutch businessman Richard (Richard Harrison; <B><A HREF="#NinjaTerminator1986">NINJA
    TERMINATOR</A></B> - 1986) arriving at the Hong Kong airport with a 
   briefcase full of diamonds. Richard is supposed to immediately 
   deliver the diamonds to his boss, Mr. Franco, but he decides to make 
   a quick stop to visit his girlfriend Mimi first. Richard and his two 
   cohorts are attacked in the parking garage of Mimi's building by 
   Philip (Philip Ko; <B><A HREF="#NinjaTheProtector">NINJA THE PROTECTOR</A></B> 
   - 1986) and two guys wielding hatchets. After dispatching Richard's 
   mates (both get hatchets in their heads), Philip steals the briefcase 
   (after kicking Richard in the stomach) and drives away. The bulk of 
   the film is some unreleased Hong Kong gangster flick about two 
   warring crime families, who are continually at each other's throats. 
   One of the families is headed by Mr. Franco<A HREF="majestic_thunderbolt_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/majestic thunderbolt danish vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (a Chinese actor in a big black afro wig who smokes using a huge 
   white cigarette holder), who actually hired Philip to steal the 
   diamonds for reasons too complicated to go into here (Weren't the 
   diamonds his to begin with?).&nbsp; When some of Franco's men kill 
   Mimi without his permission, Franco now has to kill Richard, too, so 
   he sends Philip and some other men to murder him. That's where the 
   newly-shot footage comes in, as Richard battles goon after goon using 
   rapiers, a baseball bat while wheeling down an alley on roller skates 
   (!) and finally, a showndown on a beach with Philip using guns 
   (where, for some reason, live chickens are lined-up on rocks so they 
   can be used for target practice!), swords and machetes. The film 
   proper documents the warfare between Mr. Franco and arch-rival Tiger 
   Chan, as Franco has one of Tiger Chan's sons murdered, so Chan sends 
   his other son, Allan, to get retribution. He does, using some really 
   unique ways in doing so, including exploding bathroom fixtures, 
   snakes, acid and a lumberyard band saw. All the bad guys meet fitting 
   demises and a triumphant Richard walks into the sunset while Ho's 
   patented white-on-red THE END title card flashes on-screen.&nbsp; 
   This film is the total package of demented entertainment, as both old 
   and new footage, along with the hilariously bad English dubbing, are 
   so goofy you can't help but have a good time. The character of Mr. 
   Franco is a hoot, with his huge afro, equally huge cigarette holder 
   and his penchant for sadomasochism, both in the bedroom and the 
   boardroom. Two scenes sum up Mr. Franco's demeanor perfectly: The 
   first takes place poolside at his home, where a team of female 
   synchronized swimmers perform a routine in the pool while Franco 
   poisons the three men responsible for Mimi's death a few short feet 
   away. The second scene is at a golf course, where Franco tries to 
   sink a putt, but misses by inches. His girlfriend (who, moments 
   before, we saw tied-up in Franco's bedroom while he whips her as a 
   prelude to sexual foreplay) says, &quot;It's always the same. You 
   always miss getting in!&quot; Knowing full well that she is not just 
   talking about golf, Franco slaps her and snaps, &quot;Don't say that 
   to me you goddamned stupid bitch!&quot; There's so much more 
   craziness on view in the old footage, including an exploding toilet 
   (predating <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_1987.htm">LETHAL WEAPON</A></B> 
   by a couple of years); a crucifixion that ends with a bad guy getting 
   bit on the inside of his mouth by a poisonous cobra; an acid shower; 
   Franco drowning his cheating girlfriend in a fish tank; the unique 
   death by falling chandelier equipped with a retractable spike; and a 
   band saw dismemberment. The new footage is just as crazy. You haven't 
   lived until you've seen a roller-skating Richard Harrison whacking a 
   guy with a baseball bat or watching him and Philip Ko blasting away 
   at helpless chickens. Speaking of Ko, he goes through a 
   head-scratching ritual where he paints Chinese characters on a 
   tied-up naked woman's body, then fucks her in various positions 
   (including a little doggy-style action), then stabs her in the 
   stomach and drinks her blood out of a champagne glass before he does 
   battle with Harrison. It makes no sense, but it's interesting to 
   watch (much of this footage was re-used for Ho's <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#ScorpionThunderbolt">SCORPION
    THUNDERBOLT</A></B> [1985], also starring Harrison). Most of the 
   music soundtrack is nothing but stolen riffs, including an excerpt

   are a fan of Ho's pastiche films, <B><A HREF="majestic_thunderbolt_1984c.htm">MAJESTIC

   This is another cut-and-paste martial arts actioner from producer 
   Tomas Tang and his Filmark International Ltd. production company, 
   directed by Tommy Cheng (<B><A HREF="satanic_crystals_1989.htm">SATANIC
    CRYSTALS</A></B> - 1989; which is not a pseudonym for director 
   Godfrey Ho, but one of Tang's house directors). Unfortunately, the 
   title is totally misleading, as there are no demons and the closest 
   thing to a massacre happens in the film's opening minutes. The film 
   opens with two Interpol agents (one played by an uncredited Stuart 
   Smith as agent Robinson Collins) watching an illegal exchange on a 
   ferry between two groups of Asians. When the Interpol agents call for 
   a raid of the ferry, two black-clad ninjas appear in a puff of smoke 
   and nearly kill all the good guys with their swords and hands (the 
   main bad guy gets away by jumping in the ocean and being towed away 
   by a speed boat as he clings to a rope), but the sudden appearance of 
   a good yellow-clad Golden Ninja saves the day. We then switch to some 
   unreleased modern-day Western-style action film from Thailand, where 
   Max (an uncredited Sorapong Chatri; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#EyesOfTheCondor">EYES
    OF THE CONDOR</A></B> - 1987), a &quot;man of justice&quot; (who 
   talks with a thick Australian accent!), walks into a borderland bar 
   and defends the honor of a gambler who was wrongly accused <A HREF="ninja_demons_massacre_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja demon's massacre vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>of
    cheating. The gambler, Robert Douglas (who looks neither like a 
   Robert or a Douglas), is challenged by the bar's best fighter to a 
   one-on-one match for $3,000 and when the fighter cheats and pulls out 
   a knife (after Robert gives him a good thrashing), Robert has no 
   choice but to pull out his own knife and cut the fighter's throat 
   from ear-to-ear, while Max guns down the fighter's friend for 
   refusing to pay. Max and Robert agree to protect the people of the 
   borderland town from thugs that come there to abuse them. We then 
   switch (there's a lot of head-scratching segues in this film) to 
   Julie and her crippled brother Jack, who have been called to the 
   country to tutor Lady Christine's bratty children. Lady Christine is 
   the ex-wife of Boss Willy, the region's crime kingpin, whom we first 
   meet teaching one of his underlings a lesson by stabbing him in the 
   back of the neck with a knife (you can see the tip of the knife blade 
   protruding from the front of the poor guy's neck!). Willy sends some 
   of his men to destroy the borderland bar, but Max and Robert teach 
   them all a lesson in justice. Max agrees to a duel with one of the 
   men, which turns out to be a Thai version of a Wild West shootout and 
   Max wins handily (he shoots his opponent in both arms and legs, as 
   his opponent yells out, &quot;I'm crippled!&quot;). Every once in a 
   while the film proper stops dead in its tracks by newly shot footage, 
   where bad guy Mr. Culp (Ted Brooke) sends out an enforcer (James 
   Lear) to deal with Boss Willy's enemies. This leads to a couple of 
   quickly-shot ninja fights (between the black and Golden Ninja) that 
   totally seems out of place with the tone of the rest of the film. 
   Meanwhile, Max makes life difficult for Boss Willy, and the rest of 
   the film is a series of deadly back-and-forths between Max, Robert 
   and Willy's gang. And what about Julie and her cripple brother? It 
   turns out they are not tutors at all, but are really CIA agents! When 
   Max switches sides and begins working for Willy, the question 
   becomes: Is Max a traitor or is it a ruse? I think we all know the 
   answer. Expect a lot more death before the gunsmoke clears.&nbsp; 
   It's quite apparent that the Thai film proper was trying to imitate 
   the American Western genre, with its swinging barroom doors, people 
   sporting six-shooters in hip holsters, damsels in distress and even a 
   fancy bit of knife-throwing. The shootouts and knife throwing are 
   extremely bloody (lots of splashy bullet squibs and nasty head and 
   neck trauma) and since this is a Thai film, there is plenty talk of 
   rape, but precious little nudity. The newly-shot ninja scenes are 
   totally unnecessary and foreign in this pastiche film, but the 
   sequence where one of the Golden Ninjas is defeated and explodes (!) 
   almost makes it worthwhile. As with most of these Tomas Tang 
   patchwork films (Tang and Filmark was competing against producer 
   Joseph Lai and his IFD Films production company after they were 
   partners in a production company called Asso Asia and then had a 
   nasty falling out), the story doesn't make an ounce of sense and the 
   English dubbing is unintentionally hilarious (although the more of 
   these films I watch, the better sense I get that the Australian 
   dubbing crew was having fun at Tang's expense), but it's the violence 
   and crazy situations (including Lady Christine's bloody shooting 
   death) that keeps fans of these type of films coming back for more. <B><A HREF="ninja_demons_massacre_1988b.htm">NINJA,

    screen time in a bright red ninja outfit) has joined the rebels 
   (although we never see him with any, except via some extremely poor 
   intercutting of old and new footage where the backgrounds don't 
   match), so the U.S. government sends Captain Byron (Bruce Baron; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Fireback1983">FIREBACK</A></B> 
   - 1983; who spends the majority of his screen time in a camouflage 
   ninja outfit) to stop him. Captain Byron has an inside man in the 
   opposition group named Chester (Sorapong Chatri; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#EyesOfTheCondor">EYES
    OF THE CONDOR</A></B> - 1987), who begins killing rebel soldiers 
   under the guise of the Black Knight. Chester saves the life of a 
   young woman during an attack on the gem mine, not realizing that she 
   is one of Michael's agents. When he discovers the truth, Chester 
   kidnaps and rapes her, but she turns out to be a willing victim! 
   Meanwhile, every fifteen minutes or so, Captain Byron gets into a 
   martial arts fight with one of Michael's red-clad ninjas, which 
   always results in one dead red ninja. Chester is eventually captured 
   by the rebels, who now occupy the mine (it's really hard to determine 
   who is worse, the rebels or the opposition group, as either side 
   kills indiscriminately), and he is tied-up in a barn, but is saved by 
   the woman he raped earlier (she's now dressed as a black ninja). As 
   the story gets more confusing and makes less and less sense (thanks 
   to Ho's rejiggered screenplay), Chester plays both sides against each 
   other, while Captain Byron and Michael have a final, ninja-style 
   battle.&nbsp; This is one of Ho/Lai's lesser collaborations, thanks 
   to a plot that's harder than usual to follow (Just who are the good 
   guys here? Everyone, including Chester, kills or rapes at the drop of 
   a hat.) and uninspired newly-shot scenes that lack Ho's usual 
   over-the-top style. Besides the out-of-nowhere rape scene (which 
   results in Chester running after the woman in nothing but black 
   bikini underwear when she steals his Jeep) and a final battle between 
   the rebels and the opposition at the mining operation, <B><A HREF="ninja_destroyer_1987b.htm">NINJA
    DESTROYER</A></B> contains little bang for the buck. It's hard to 
   imagine that any Indonesian action film can be this boring, but this 
   one is, especially in this reedited version. There are a couple of 
   bloody shootings, stabbings and martial arts fights, but thanks to 
   the confusing storyline (especially the &quot;Huh?&quot; ending of 
   the film proper), it's hard to give a damn. Even the final fight 
   between Captain Byron and Michael (Michael says, &quot;Fuck the 
   politicians!&quot;, while Byron replies, &quot;I'm not trying to be a 
   Rambo!&quot; What?!?) is ho-hum, as Ho depends too much on reverse 
   photography and Michael is killed way too easily after an 
   all-too-short fight (which includes throwing stars, a crossbow and 
   swords). Not one of Godfrey Ho's best (an oxymoron if there ever was 
   one!). Bruce Baron, Stuart Smith and Sorapong Chatri also starred in 
   Ho's <B><A HREF="#UltimateNinja">THE ULTIMATE NINJA</A></B> (1986),

   By now we all know the score to these type of films: Ho takes an 
   action film that has never been released, reworks the story lines and 
   then adds newly-shot scenes with Caucasian actors that interfere the

   in the film proper, as some one has just <A HREF="ninja_empire_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja empire vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>killed
    her sister at Judy's modeling agency/beauty school. Brad (Marko 
   Ritchie) handles all the action in the newly shot scenes, fighting 
   evil bad guy Mike Abbott and his henchmen with guns every 15 minutes 
   (The only way Bonnie and Brad actually meet is by telephone, an old 
   trick in these Ho pastiche films). While Bonnie and her extremely 
   loud motorcycle trails the bad guys responsible for her sister's 
   death (how the bad guys don't hear her motorcycle is one of those 
   great filmic flubs), Brad is being hunted down by boss Mike Abbot's 
   henchmen with automatic weapons and Brad uses his Ninja training to 
   disappear in a cloud of smoke and appear behind the bad guys and blow 
   them away with his pistol. When Judy is killed and Bonnie finally 
   realizes that her sister is really dead, she dons a huge crossbow and 
   goes looking for revenge on lead bad guy Tiger (a guy with a balding 
   head who could look like anyone's grandfather) and all his 
   underlings. Expect plenty of crossbow impalings, throat slittings and 
   some really bad martial arts fights (This is also the kind of film 
   where when you get hit hard, a big purple bruise shows up on your 
   face immediately!). Bonnie finishes her business by killing Tiger, so 
   Brad takes-on Mike Abbott one-on-one for a fight to the death in 
   their ninja suits using guns instead of swords. It ends on one of the 
   funniest freeze-frames in the Ho history of films. <B>THE NINJA EMPIRE</B> 
   contains all the earmarks of a Ho/Lai film: Borrowed music (The theme 
   from <B><A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> is quite 
   prominently played); laughable English dubbing done by an Australian 
   crew (&quot;Ninjas&quot; turn into &quot;Ninjers&quot;); plenty of 
   phone calls to bridge the new footage to the old footage; and some 
   surprising full frontal female nudity during a shower sequence 
   (although another lovemaking scene is blurred out by big black bars 
   that take up half the frame!). If you like this type of bastardized 
   film (count me in as a fan), you could do a lot worse than this. It's 
   funny, bloody, has plot holes you could drive a jittney through and

   cut-and-paste martial actioner from producer Joseph Lai, who also 
   handles the directorial reins here (Godfrey Ho, who usually directs 
   these, only wrote the screenplay here, using the name &quot;Stephen 
   Soul&quot;). It is the standard mixture of newly-shot footage, this 
   time featuring Richard Harrison (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#ScorpionThunderbolt">SCORPION

   Anderson and his nemesis, The Boss (Stuart Smith; <B><A HREF="#NinjaDestroyer">NINJA
    DESTROYER</A></B> - 1987), and old footage; this time an obscure 
   Hong Kong gangster actioner. In the beginning of the film, two 
   black-clad ninjas in The Boss' employ steal a top-secret formula 
   marked &quot;Strictly Confidential&quot; (on a VHS tape, no less!) 
   called DAK-10 and deliver it to The Boss. Since DAK-10 is very 
   dangerous (it boosts the morale and killing instincts of soldiers), 
   Interpol sends Gordon to Hong Kong to get it back. Gordon's partner 
   in Hong Kong, Aaron <A HREF="ninja_hunt_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja hunt vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(this
    is where the old footage begins and takes up 85% of the running 
   time), goes undercover to steal the formula from crime kingpin 
   Campbell. Aaron befriends Campbell's precocious 11 year-old 
   prot&eacute;g&eacute; Billy (who, in this rewritten screenplay, is 
   Gordon's son, who he hasn't seen since he was born), a chain-smoking 
   kid who acts like he owns the town. Aaron uses Billy to get close to 
   Campbell, while Billy's mother, Rachel, Campbell's mistress, frets 
   over the sudden appearance of Gordon and his newfound interest in 
   Billy (It's also one of the worst examples of intercutting old and 
   new footage you will ever see and, if you've ever seen any of these 
   Lai/Ho pastiche films, you know that's saying a lot). To further 
   confuse matters, Billy thinks that Rachel is his aunt rather than his 
   mother, because Rachel runs Campbell's whorehouse and she doesn't 
   want Billy to know his mother is a madame. Every fifteen minutes or 
   so, the film proper is interrupted as Gordon (who is dressed in a 
   camouflage ninja outfit) has brief battles with The Boss' black-clad 
   ninjas (You can tell they are ninjas because the wear headbands with 
   the word &quot;NINJA&quot; emblazoned on the front) and kills them in 
   quick fashion. Billy and Aaron become fast friends and when Billy 
   gives Aaron some important information on Campbell's operations, it 
   leads to all kinds of hijinks, including martial arts battles, 
   gunfights and Billy's life being put in peril (Where is Child 
   Protective Services when you need them?). Will Billy be saved and 
   learn who his mother and father really are? Will Ninja Master Gordon 
   defeat The Boss in the final battle? Well, Billy does get to see his 
   mother shot dead, so at least the film is not a total waste.&nbsp; 
   This disjointed martial arts actioner contains all the usual Lai 
   trademarks: Hilarious English dubbing (Rachel whispers into a 
   sleeping Billy's ear: &quot;Your mother is a wanton hussy and a 
   whore!&quot;), terrible intercutting of old and new footage (they 
   didn't even bother to try and match the backgrounds), ninjas who can 
   appear and disappear at will (Where can I get my hands on this 
   power?) and stolen music tracks (the most obvious here is Planet P 
   Project's &quot;Power Tools&quot;, which plays during a disco 
   sequence). There is nothing here to distinguish it from the dozens of cut-and-paste
    films that Joseph Lai, Godfrey Ho and Tomas Tang churned-out from 
   the mid-80's to the early-90's, but at least it doesn't skimp of the 
   female nudity (including panty crotch-grabbing) or shy away from 
   putting a little boy in deadly peril every chance they get. The 
   newly-shot footage is a total waste, though, and contains none of the 
   goofy weapons (Where are the golden boomerangs? The multi-colored 
   smoke bombs?) or bloody action we've come to depend on. The film 
   doesn't really conclude, it just ends. Also starring Geoffrey Brown,

    MASTERS OF DEATH</A><A NAME="NinjaMastersDeath"></A> (1985) -</B> 
   Another hoary cut-and-paste martial arts flick from director Godfrey 
   Ho (using the pseudonym &quot;Bruce Lambert&quot; here), made for 
   producer Tomas Tang's Filmark International production outfit. It's 
   hard to believe, but this one makes even less sense than Ho's many 
   other pastiche chop socky doosies. Here's what I am able to discern 
   from the plot: Evil yellow ninja Michael and his band of ninjas join 
   the National Army on a secret mission called &quot;Project 
   Daredevil&quot;, which is never fully explained to the audience (at 
   least not in this version). Good purple ninja George and his purple 
   ninja gang (who actually dress in white ninja outfits!) join the 
   common people to defeat the National Army and Michael's yellow ninja 
   gang (who, yep, dress in black ninja outfits). The Army goes out on a 
   raid and capture a <A HREF="ninja_masters_of_death_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja masters of death vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>young
    boy named Jimmy, who is rallying the people to overthrow the Army. 
   The Army squad leader, Major Lee, questions the kid (&quot;Tell me 
   what you know or I'll bayonette you and feed you to the 
   wolves!&quot;), but it soons develops into an uncle/nephew-type 
   relationship. Every fifteen minutes or so, yellow ninja Michael and 
   his men fight purple ninja George and his men and then disappear in a 
   puff of multicolored smoke. Major Lee tells Jimmy that his father was 
   once Michael's number three man (he even calls him &quot;Number 
   Three&quot;!), but he left Michael's outfit when he found out Michael 
   was only in it for the money, which is against the &quot;ninja 
   code&quot;. Flashbacks show Jimmy's mother was raped and killed (a 
   recurring theme in these films) and his father brutally butchered by 
   Michael's black ninjas. After he hears the story, Jimmy vows to 
   become a &quot;ninja hunter&quot;. Then, Major Lee and Jimmy are 
   injured in a raid and recuperate in a hospital. Jimmy is adopted by a 
   Professor and his wife, but is kidnapped by Michael's men for 
   &quot;reconditioning&quot;. Major Lee rescues him (it doesn't end 
   pretty) and there's a final battle between George and Michael, which 
   includes multiple explosions, smokey hand-to-hand combat, 
   grenade-firing nunchucks and a flame-throwing dagger. I'm not going 
   to defend this film or any of Godfrey Ho's badly-edited 
   amalgamations, except to say this: What they lack in common sense and 
   coherence, they more than make up for in loony visuals, hilarious 
   dubbing and way-out-there action. All of these films follow the same 
   basic formula: Take some unreleased or little-seen Hong Kong martial 
   arts flick (this one seems to be more of a war film, though), add 
   some newly-shot scenes of white men dressed in colorful ninja 
   outfits, make up a totally new plot, add some hilarious dubbing done 
   by British voiceover talent and have at least one ninja fight every 
   15 to 20 minutes, with the big fight at the end. Since the films make 
   no sense, the entertainment comes from the strange visuals, 
   exaggerated sound effects and off-kilter dialogue. This one is no 
   different. Jimmy stands on an ox cart and gives an impassioned speech 
   to the people that starts with, &quot;The Army doesn't give a shit 
   about you!&quot; After he is done with his speech, one audience 
   member can be heard saying, &quot;The ninjas are pussies!&quot; When 
   Jimmy is hurt in the raid, you see the lifeless body of his pet 
   rabbit roll down a hill. What can I say? I'm a sucker for cheap 
   sentimentality! We never do find out what exactly &quot;Project 
   Daredevil&quot; really is all about (it's dropped as soon as it is 
   mentioned) and there's enough lapses in logic to have this film 
   committed to a mental institution (I'm not sure if the National Army 
   are the good or the bad guys), but it's not without a lot of 
   unintentional entertainment value (including an unexpected ending for 
   Jimmy and an unbelievable you-have-to-see-it death of yellow ninja 
   Michael). Starring Chris Peterson, Daniel Wells, Richard Young, Kelly 
   Kruize, Mick Jones, Henry Band, Nancy Nelson and Rio Smith. Also

   KGB's way is CIA agent Mason (Christofer Kohlberg) and his band of

   Russia with the help of two CIA agents (who garrot, stab and shoot 
   the Russian soldiers with silencers that sound like phaser fire), the 
   KGB increase their attempts to kidnap Nadia, in hopes of using her as 
   leverage to bring her father back to Russia. Enemy agents grab Nadia 
   at her nightclub (a huge gunfight breaks out and many innocent 
   nightclub patrons are gunned down) and Mason chases them in his car, 
   but they get away in a helicopter. It is at this time that we learn 
   that Professor Markov was tricked by the Russians to believe he was

   Ableman (Hans Rosteen), a KGB agent pretending to be a United Nations 
   envoy, who will work with Markov to finish his research (it has 
   something to do with a new energy source). While the Russians have 
   Markov and Nadia fooled into believing that they are safe in Sweden 
   (hey, snow looks the same in Russia as it does in Sweden), Mason and 
   the ninjas set explosive charges around the building where they are 
   being held, giving them 30 minutes to rescue Markov and Nadia. Mason 
   is captured after revealing the truth to Markov and Ableman has to 
   brand Nadia on the neck with a hot poker before Markov will finish

    ISLAND</A></B> [1986] and <B><A HREF="russian_terminator_1989.htm">RUSSIAN
    TERMINATOR</A></B> [1989]), is a strange film to pigeonhole. When 
   you think of ninjas, Sweden doesn't remotely spring to mind, but this 
   film contains so much violent imagery, including people getting shot 
   in the head, impaled with flying stars, sliced with swords, riddled 
   with bullets (filmed in slow-motion, used for good effect in some 
   scenes) and a truly disgusting scene of a guy throwing-up in his gas 
   mask (after breathing poisonous gas) and then falling down, his face 
   flopping around in the vomit while he dies. Hanna Ploa also exposes 
   her breasts within the first ten minutes of the film (unfortunately 
   the nudity ends there). As far as ninja action goes, there is 
   precious little after the opening moments until the finale, where 
   they assault the Russian compound. The preferred method of violence 
   here is gunplay, which is all well and good because the ninja martial 
   arts violence seems to be a couple of lame fights and a few instances 
   of swordplay, including a very nasty decapitation. I did like the 
   explosive dart guns that were used in the finale. When the dart would 
   hit a person, it injected a fluid into their body, causing them to 
   explode a few seconds later! The body count in this film is pretty 
   high (way over 100 on-screen deaths) and the dubbing, while 
   noticable, is adequate and matches the actors' lip movements (it 
   looks as if most of the actors were speaking English anyway), even if 
   there is some questionable dialogue (&quot;You are talking crap!&quot;
    &quot;Hey, go fuck an Eskimo!&quot;). You can tell this is a Swedish 
   flick because nearly every male character (with the exception of 
   Mason) sports bushy beards and moustaches. We're not talking Ingmar 
   Bergman here, but it is a wild way to spend 95 minutes. Also starring 
   Bo F. Munthe, John Qvantz, Sirka Sander, Wolf Linder and Leo 
   Adolfson. The Swedish DVD on the 24 Bilder label is fully uncut and 
   the way to go if you have an all region DVD player. The VHS version 
   on the <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Media Home Ent.">Media

   Ninja master Morris is smuggling arms into Hong Kong during the 
   Vietnam War and Army prisoner Ford is freed to stop Morris, because 
   the C.I.A. trained him to &quot;overcome evil&quot;. So begins 
   another one of director Godfrey Ho's (using the name &quot;Bruce 
   Lambert&quot;) patchwork martial arts flicks for producer Tomas 
   Tang's Filmark International production company. When in Hong Kong, 
   Ford (who is given the code name &quot;Condor&quot;) meets new 
   partner Christine (code name &quot;Yellow Bird&quot;) and together 
   they fight Morris' ninja men. Meanwhile, in the old footage, Allen, 
   who works as an enforcer for a local godfather, wants out of the 
   Mafia, while his friends Baldy, Boney and Fatty want in. Allen is 
   also in love with another godfather's daughter, Jane, which makes his 
   predicament even harder, since Jane's brother, Alvin, has a severe 
   dislike for Allen. When a third godfather takes a major arms deal 
   with a Middle East country away from Morris and<A HREF="ninja_phanton_heroes_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja phantom heroes vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Allen's godfather, the godfather orders Allen to kidnap the rival 
   godfather. Allen lets Boney attempt the kidnapping, but it backfires 
   and Boney is kidnapped and forced to make an incriminating audio tape 
   that could put Allen and his godfather in prison. After Allen kills 
   Boney for screwing up, he goes to Boney's cousin Bert to make amends, 
   but Bert gets killed instead when he is attacked and stabbed to death 
   by a motorcycle gang loyal to the third godfather. We then learn that 
   Ford and Morris were once partners during the Vietnam War, illegally 
   supplying arms to the VC gooks. They were both caught and imprisoned, 
   but Morris escaped and fled to Hong Kong, where he became an arms 
   dealer to the highest bidder. Now, when they fight, Ford turns into a 
   ninja wearing a camouflage ninja outfit and Morris turns into a 
   white-uniformed ninja (Morris' ninja men wear black). When Alvin 
   kills Allen's godfather, Allen goes on the warpath and kills Alvin 
   and all his rivals with a sawed-off rifle, before being killed 
   himself. The finale finds Ford fighting Morris and his ninjas in a 
   park, using swords, exploding stars (one black ninja, seeing a star 
   stuck in his upper torso, says &quot;Uh oh!&quot; just before 
   exploding into little bits), grenade-firing spears, flying silver 
   plates, a flying sawed-edged bell and a rocket-firing umbrella!&nbsp; 
   Quite simply, this film is the pits. It doesn't even contain the 
   retarded charm and crazy scenes that most of these Godfrey Ho 
   cut-and-paste films usually offer. For a film that's supposed to be 
   taking place during the Vietnam war, there sure are a lot of 80's 
   fashions and cars on view. The only martials arts present in this 
   film are in the newly-shot scenes and those come few and far between. 
   The old footage seems to come from some unreleased Hong Kong crime 
   thriller from the early-to-mid-80's. The only excitement in this 
   footage comes pretty late in the game, when Bert is attacked by the 
   motorcycle gang and spends the rest of his screen time with a huge 
   knife sticking out of his stomach. The rest of the old footage is 
   slow and confusing until the massacre in the finale, where Allen 
   kills nearly everyone with his unusual rifle while Baldy and Fatty 
   come to the rescue, with disasterous results. The final fight between 
   Ford and Morris is pretty funny, as is the abrupt ending (Ford's

   - 1971). Under intense questioning, Lenny (who uses nearly half a box

   kingpin Rudolph (Stuart Smith), who also happens to be a ninja. When 
   Rudolph finds out about Lenny's treachery, he goes into ninja mode 
   and slices up Lenny and a couple of Interpol agents. Rudolph sends a 
   couple of his ninjas to kill Alvin (Alphonse Beni) and his wife Donna 
   ((Mandiere Nathalie) on their fourth wedding anniversary. There won't

    as the ninjas kill Donna, but Alvin (surprise!) turns into a yellow 
   ninja and kills the two intruders. Rudolph makes a hasty retreat to 
   Hong Kong and Alvin follows him there to get retribution. Yes, this 
   is the beginning of another of director Godfrey Ho's cut-and-paste 
   martial arts flicks featuring newly-shot footage of Richard Harrison 
   as &quot;Ninja Master Gordon&quot; intercut with footage of some 
   unreleased Hong Kong martial arts flick, usually with hilarious 
   results. The Hong Kong footage is about a guy named Edmond, who is 
   out to avenge the death of his father at the hands of crime boss 
   Tiger. Tiger works with crooked Interpol agent Norman (Grant Temple), 
   who is also working with Rudolph. Alvin gets Gordon and fellow agent 
   John Lee (Ricky Shaw) to help him find and kill Rudolph. Edmond finds 
   a friend in female motorcycle chick Vivian, who helps him track down 
   Tiger, but first they must fight hordes of his men. Edmond is 
   searching for a man with a panther tattoo (a witness saw the tattoo 
   on Edmond's father's killer), so he goes around ripping off the 
   shirts of guys looking for it, which always gets him in trouble. In 
   the conclusion, Edmond and a friendly cop capture Tiger after a 
   bloody battle and Gordon and Alvin battle Norman and Rudolph &quot;to 
   the death&quot;. All the bad guys get their's in the end (and in the 
   front, too!).&nbsp; This Ho-directed fiasco, produced by Joseph Lai 
   and Betty Chan for their IFD Films &amp; Arts Ltd. production 
   company, contains much more new footage than is normally found in 
   these patchwork films. Over 40% of the film is the newly-shot 
   footage, most of it scenes of Alvin, Gordon and John Lee fighting 
   ninjas in the same park location, interspread throughout the film. As 
   in most of these films, all the ninjas, both good and bad, wear 
   headbands with the word &quot;Ninja&quot; written across the front, 
   just in case we don't confuse them with firemen or fry cooks. The old 
   footage contains some pretty good stunts, such as when Edmond jumps 
   over two cars trying to run him over (he does get hit by another car 
   later on and it looks real painful) or when he takes a slo-mo dive 
   off a bridge to avoid some of Tiger's men. In the new footage, both 
   Richard Harrison and Alphonse Beni portray yellow-clad ninjas and the 
   way you can tell them apart (besides Beni being a Black man) is that 
   Harrison wears a red sash and Beni wears a blue one. As with all 
   these films, the dubbing raises a chuckle or two, such as when Edmond 
   says, &quot;Take off your shirt!&quot; to every guy he sees or when 
   Vivian warns Edmond, &quot;If you look at my tattoo, I'll kill 
   you!&quot; and then Edmond aplologises and tells her that he didn't 
   know she was a woman! The new footage contains such sights as 
   watermelon burning (yes, you read that correctly), ninjas that can 
   disappear and reappear at will and the ninja's favorite weapon of 
   choice: a silver boomerang! This is entertainment for the brain dead.

    SQUAD</A><A NAME="NinjaSquad"></A> (1987) -</B> Another one of 
   director Godfrey Ho's ridiculous cut-and-paste martial arts actioners 
   that he made for Joseph Lai's IFD Films &amp; Arts Ltd. production 
   outfit. The film proper (i.e. the old footage) is about a man called 
   Billy, who returns home after ten years of martial arts training with 
   Ninja Master Gordon (Richard Harrison, in badly matched new footage). 
   Billy returns just in time to see gangsters trying to force his 
   mother and brother out of their home. A fight ensues and Billy beats 
   the crap out of them, which pisses off the local crime boss, who 
   happens to be using Billy's sister as a drug mule (are you able to 
   follow this?). Meanwhile, in the newly-shot footage, Ninja Master 
   Gordon is called-out by evil ninja master Ivan The Red (Dave 
   Wheeler), who tells Gordon that he will kill one of Gordon's good 
   ninjas every day until Gordon accepts his challenge of a fight to the 
   death. Of course, Gordon refuses at first, so every twenty minutes or 
   so we see Ivan The Red (who, true to his name, wears a red ninja 
   outfit) killing a good ninja in short fight scenes. Back to the main 
   plot, Billy starts helping the local popula<A HREF="ninja_squad_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja squad german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>tion
    fight the Boss, while he gets closer to saving his sister. The Boss 
   retaliates by sending some men to Billy's house and shooting it up, 
   killing his mother. Billy (who talks about joining the local police 
   force, but never seems to find the time to do so) teams up with a 
   local cop to avenge his mother's death and finally find his sister. 
   Complicating matters is the fact that Billy's girlfriend, Lisa, is 
   the daughter of the local police chief, who hates Billy's guts with a 
   passion and wants to arrest him for the rash of ninja killings in 
   town. Billy gets drunk at a bar and goes home with Ivy (a woman he 
   saved from a purse snatching earlier in the film). That night, some 
   of the Boss' men break into Ivy's house and kill her, but Billy gets 
   away. After Ivy's dead body is discovered, the police chief orders 
   Billy's arrest and he must avoid the police dragnet while he takes 
   down the Boss' organization one man at a time until he rescues his 
   sister. Gordon, meanwhile, receives a message (delivered via a golden 
   boomerang!) from Ivan The Red: The headbands of all the good ninjas 
   he has killed! Gordon finally says enough is enough and has a 
   showdown with Ivan in the finale (Gordon wears a stylish purple ninja 
   ensemble). Billy also has a showdown with The Boss (his first name is 
   Larry!) in a ship's graveyard. Billy kills him, saves his sister and 
   is shot dead while surrendering to the police.&nbsp; This is standard 
   Godfrey Ho kookiness. This time he's taken some unreleased 80's 
   Filipino action film and spliced-in footage of Richard Harrison and a 
   bunch of other Caucasian actors fighting in the same park that can be 
   viewed in most of Ho's other patchwork films (he must have saved a 
   bundle by not hiring a location scout). Richard Harrison, who has 
   appeared in dozens of these Ho-directed abominations, usually with 
   the word &quot;Ninja&quot; in the title (Harrison swears that Ho 
   duped him and thought he was only signed on to do about four films, a 
   claim I find highly dubious since none of Harrison's scenes seem to 
   have any type of connecting narrative), has even less to do here than 
   in most of these films. His only fight scene is the final battle and 
   he spends most of his screen time walking around reading letters and 
   death threats. As with all of these films, the dubbing (by an 
   Australian crew) is atrocious and hilarious. My favorite scene comes 
   when some of the Boss' men have Billy trapped on a dock and the head 
   bad guy gives Billy till a count of ten to give himself up. It goes 
   something like this: &quot;...6...7...8...9...9&#189;...your last 
   chance! I tried...10!&quot; You gotta love it!&nbsp; My favorite 
   character is Ivy, who sounds like she grew up in Alabama and then 
   moved to the Outback. There's enough fighting and gunplay here to 
   keep your eyes occupied but, even if you were born with half a brain, 
   your mind will be saying, &quot;This is retarded!&quot; <B><A HREF="ninja_squad_1987b.htm">NINJA

   is one of Godfrey Ho's most entertaining (and, by default, one of his 
   looniest) cut-and-paste martial arts flicks starring Richard 
   Harrison. The film opens in Japan, with Harry (Harrison) and two 
   other ninjas delivering pieces of the Golden Ninja Warrior statue to 
   their Master, who puts the pieces together and then transforms into 
   the Supreme Ninja, whose skin<A HREF="ninja_terminator_1986b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja terminator poster front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   becomes impervious to swords (A disbelieving Harry takes a swing of 
   his sword to his Master's arm to put the claim to the test. When the 
   sword bounces off his arm with a metallic clanging sound, Harry seems 
   satisfied). Harry and his cohorts, Baron (Jonathan Wattis) and 
   Tomache, each steal a piece of the statue and disappear and their 
   Master doesn't take it too well, telling his followers to get the 
   pieces back no matter what it takes. Two years later in Hong Kong, 
   one of the Master's ninjas kills Tomache and retrieves one piece of 
   the Golden Ninja Warrior. In the rejiggered old footage (of some 
   unreleased Hong Kong action flick), now-crime syndicate boss Baron 
   (in ineptly inserted new footage) orders his head henchman Tiger Chan 
   (Wong Chen Li, in a ridiculous blonde pageboy wig) to retrieve the 
   body of Tomache from his brother Ikaza and sister Machico. Baron 
   believes that the body of Tomache, along with his piece of the Golden 
   Ninja Warrior statue, will give him great powers (I know it doesn't 
   make an ounce of sense, but just go along with it and quit asking 
   logical questions!). Hong Kong muscle Jaguar Wong (Jack Lam) is 
   assigned to protect Machico after Ikaza is murdered and gets into 
   several martial arts fights with Tiger Chan's goons. Meanwhile, Harry 
   dons a camouflage ninja outfit and battles his Master's red-clad 
   ninjas every fifteen minutes or so. Jaguar falls in love with 
   Machico, so when she is kidnapped by Tiger's men, he must let himself 
   be captured and tortured in order to get close to Machico. When that 
   doesn't work (when does it ever?), Jaguar kidnaps Tiger's girlfriend, 
   Lily (Nancy Chan), and offers a trade. Things don't go according to 
   plan (when does it ever?), as Jaguar must fight to save Machico's 
   life. Harry gets into a memorable ninja fight in the finale that's 
   priceless for the look on his face in the final shot. And remember 
   folks: &quot;Born a ninja, die a ninja!&quot;&nbsp; While the 
   description of the film doesn't sound too promising, it's Ho's wild 
   visuals and flair for the absurd that will win you over. <B><A HREF="ninja_terminator_1985.htm">NINJA

   when Harry's female friend (Maria Francesca) is cooking him a dish 
   called the &quot;Drunken Crab&quot; and she spills the live crabs all 
   over the kitchen floor and screams in terror. Harry's response is to 
   impale one of the crabs with a ninja throwing spike and laugh (as we 
   watch the poor crab hobble around with a spike in it's shell!). Harry 
   is later visited by a toy robot at his front door and it tells him 
   that he has three days to return his piece <A HREF="ninja_terminator_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja terminator british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>of
    the statue to the Master. A few short seconds later, Harry's 
   Garfield The Cat telephone (which also makes an appearance in Ho's <B><A HREF="#Diamond Ninja Force">DIAMOND
    NINJA FORCE</A></B> [1986]) rings and the Master's head ninja&nbsp;

   cut-and-paste for producer Joseph Lai, such as <B><A HREF="#AngelsBloodMission">ANGEL'S
    BLOOD MISSION</A></B> [1988]) gives Harry the exact same warning, 
   just in case the robot didn't make itself clear! The film contains 
   zero logic (we are led to believe that the entire Golden Ninja 
   Warrior statue gives the owner powers of invulnerability, but both 
   Harry and Baron seem to have the same power just by owning pieces of 
   it), but there's enough brain-scratching action on view, including 
   Jaguar's many martial arts fights (he certainly likes to punch and 
   kick his opponents in the crotch a lot), the Harrison footage (which 
   is funny as hell) and spotting the terrible integration of old and 
   new footage. The final martial arts battles between both Jaguar and 
   Tiger (which takes on a beach, where the heavy-footed Tiger ends up 
   buried up to his waist in the sand after performing a high jump!) and 
   Harry, Baron and the Master's head ninja, who all bring their pieces 
   of the statue and duke it out for ownership, using swords, flying 
   stars and multi-colored whistling smoke grenades, are works of 
   demented art. I especially liked the scene when Harry is the last one 
   left alive after the head ninja commits hara-kiri by blowing himself 
   up, which seems to take Harrison, the actor, by complete surprise, as 
   if someone forgot to tell him that a loud explosion was about to take 
   place behind him. The look on his face is priceless. Not to be 
   confused with <B><A HREF="#GoldenNinjaWarrior">GOLDEN NINJA WARRIOR</A></B>

    THE PROTECTOR</A><A NAME="NinjaTheProtector"></A> (1986) -</B> 
   &quot;Born a ninja, die a ninja.&quot; So begins another Godfrey 
   Ho-directed pastiche combining footage from an unreleased Hong Kong 
   martial arts flick and newly-shot footage featuring Richard Harrison 
   and other Caucasian actors. Harrison stars as Jason Hart, the leader 
   of a squad of cops trying to bring down Bruce (David Bowles), the 
   leader of a gang of money counterfeiters and also an evil red ninja. 
   Jason is also secretly a ninja (he wears a camouflage ninja outfit 
   here), who captures (or kills) members of Bruce's ninja force and 
   anonomously calls his comrades with a location where to pick them up 
   (One handcuffed ninja says to Jason's squad member Andy [Andy 
   Chorowsky], &quot;Only a ninja can defeat another ninja!&quot; when 
   he asks who handcuffed him. Andy simple replies, &quot;What's a 
   ninja?&quot;). The Hong Kong footage is reworked to make it seem like 
   Jason has an undercover cop named Warren (Warren Chan) working for 
   one of <A HREF="ninja_the_protector_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja the protector vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Bruce's
    associates to gather more information on the counterfeiting ring. He 
   works as a fashion model (!) for an agency run by Susan (Vera Wang). 
   He gets into many fist fights, his girlfriend Judy (Morna Lee) gets 
   raped and his brother David thinks Warren has turned into a thug. 
   Meanwhile, every 20 minutes or so, Bruce sends another one of his 
   ninjas to kill Jason, but fails every time. Jason and his men set up 
   a sting in a park to nab $2,000,000 in phony bills. The crook gets 
   away, but Jason turns into a ninja and captures him, handcuffing him 
   to a tree so Andy can find him. Susan's jealous boyfriend Four Eyes 
   (Mike Tien), also a Bruce associate, beats Susan with a belt when he 
   finds out she has made love to Warren. He also sends Judy a photo of 
   Warren and Susan making love. Judy leaves Warren and David is 
   accosted by Four Eyes' men. In the finale, Warren and David defeat 
   Four Eyes and Jason and Bruce fight each other on motorcycles (a 
   joust involving nunchucks and swords) and then on land, where Jason 
   kills Bruce. Jason proudly proclaims over Bruce's dying body, &quot;I 
   am the champion of the ninjas!&quot;&nbsp; The story goes that 
   director Godfrey Ho hired Richard Harrison to star in a couple of 
   films, but after filming them, cut them up into pieces and created 
   about two dozen films like this one. Why release two films when you 
   can release twenty-four? Richard Harrison was supposedly so 
   disappointed with Ho's trickery, it is said that it led to him 
   quitting acting in the early 90's because his reputation as an actor 
   was permanently tarnished. I don't know if all that's true, but these 
   films have a retarded charm that can't be denied. All these films 
   contain ninjas that appear and disappear in a puff of smoke; 
   exaggerated sound effects; they all have at least one rape scene 
   (this one does contain more nudity than normal, though); the same 
   white cordless phone is seen in many of these films (in <B><A HREF="#Instant Rage">INSTANT
    RAGE</A></B> [1988], it is used as a walkie-talkie!); the 
   intercutting between old and new footage is obvious and, in some 
   cases, hilarious; the dubbing is equally preposterous and funny; and 
   some of the newly-shot fight scenes are outrageous and 
   gravity-defying. <B><A HREF="ninja_the_protector_1986d.htm">NINJA THE PROTECTOR</A></B>

    OF THE BUSHIDO BLADE</A><A NAME="RevengeBushidoBlade"></A> (1978) -</B> 
   Pretty decent, although talky, Philippines-lensed revenge actioner. 
   On March 2, 1945, a platoon of American Rangers and a squad of 
   Filipino soldiers raid a Japanese outpost somewhere in the 
   Japanese-occupied Philippines. After killing the Japanese commanding 
   officer (Butz Aquino), a group of soldiers, led by Cpl. Steadman (who 
   is due to be court-martialed for unknown offenses once this raid is 
   over), gang-rape the CO's wife while his young son watches 
   helplessly. When Steadman's commanding officer stops the rape, 
   Steadman shoots him and then shoots the Jap wife, having his two 
   cohorts, Dante Salazar and Mike Sills, cover-up the murders by saying 
   the Jap wife shot their commanding officer and Steadman had no choice 
   but to shoot her. When the Americans leave the outpost, the young boy 
   walks around in a state of shock while screaming out 
   &quot;Bushido!&quot; over and over. Flash-forward to March 27, 1978, 
   and the young boy is now a 40 year-old man named Tamon Matsuda 
   (co-producer Leo Fong; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Killpoint">KILLPOINT</A></B> 
   - 1984), who lives in San Francisco and plans on getting even with 
   the soldiers involved in his parents' deaths; those same soldiers who

    The soldiers, 33 years older (and played by different actors), 
   include: Sam Hacker (Cameron Mitchell; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#LowBlow1986">LOW
    BLOW</A></B> - 1986), who saved Tamon's life when he was a boy; Mike 
   Sills (Philip Baker Hall; <B><A HREF="boogie_nights_1997.htm">BOOGIE NIGHTS</A></B> 
   - 1997), who is now a hopeless alcoholic; Dante Salazar (Charlie 
   Davao), now a famous, over-the-hill Filipino martial arts movie star; 
   Frank Washington (Stack Pierce; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Transformed2003">TRANSFORMED</A></B> 
   - 2003), the only black man in the platoon; Raul Amante (Vic 
   Salayan), the local Chief of Police; and, of course, Steadman (Hal 
   Bokar), who is still as racist and vulgar as ever. Tamon arrives in 
   Manila and, after watching the remnants of the house where he lived 
   as a small child being bulldozed under, sets out to get justice with 
   a Bushido sword, first beheading Quantaz (Kim Ramos), who, as a young 
   boy, led the Americans to the Japanese outpost. While Hacker and his 
   old squad get into drunken trouble (usually thanks to Steadman and 
   his racist or misogynistic rants), Tamon continues his killing spree, 
   murdering Dante Salazar (by snapping his neck) while pretending to be 
   the Stunt Coordinator on his latest film. Tamon kills Mike next 
   (another sword decapitation) and Raul finally puts police protection 
   on Hacker, Frank and Steadman when Tamon is finally unmasked and his 
   motives revealed. Tamon manages to bypass police security and kidnap 
   Steadman and brings him to an explosives shed on his parents' old 
   property. Tamon invites Hacker to plead for Steadman's life, but once 
   Hacker discovers Steadman's role in Tamon's mother's rape and murder, 
   he walks away while Tamon blows himself and Steadman to pieces. 
   Hacker turns to Frank and Raul and says something so deep, I had to 
   rewind several times just to make sure I heard it right (No, no. I'm 
   not gonna tell. Watch it for yourself!).&nbsp; While nothing 
   spectacular, <B><A HREF="revenge_of_the_bushido_blade_1978b.htm">REVENGE
    OF THE BUSHIDO BLADE</A></B> (also known as <B>THE LAST REUNION</B> 
   and <B><A HREF="ninja_nightmare_1978.htm">NINJA NIGHTMARE</A></B>) 
   contains enough bloodshed and laughable human drama to keep most 
   viewers entertained. Director/editor Jay Wertz (this is his only 
   directorial effort) and screenwriter Donald G. Thompson ladle-on the 
   stereotypes, making many of the Americans drunks, rapists or racists 
   (or all three) and all the local Filipinos experts in martial arts. 
   While making Cameron Mitchell a drunk may seem like art imitating 
   life, the only actor here who makes any impression is Philip Baker 
   Hall as the eternally soused Mike Sills. At least there is a valid 
   reason for his character to be drunk and the scene where he confronts 
   Tamon in his hotel room and gladly gives up his life (his decapitated 
   head is left on a serving tray in Steadman's hotel room), is the only 
   instance of real acting in the entire film. There are some other 
   stabs at relevancy, such as when the adult Tamon tours the 
   Philippines and its WWII landmarks (while gunshots and exploding 
   bombs are heard on the soundtrack), but it all rings hollow and seem 
   to be nothing more than padding when taken in context with the rest 
   of the film. Still, <B>REVENGE</B> contains enough violence and 
   unintentionally funny lines of dialogue to keep genre fans amused. 
   Filipino staple James Gaines portrays a young Frank Washington and 
   Charlie Davao Jr and Larry Salayan portray their fathers' younger 
   selves during the WWII scenes. Also starring Chandra Romero, Joe Mari 
   Avellana, Galen Thompson, Rob Stuart, Hope Holiday, Paul Le Clair and

    ULTIMATE NINJA</A><A NAME="UltimateNinja"></A> (1986) -</B> When his 
   ninja master is killed by the evil ninja Victor (Bruce Baron) and his 
   men, Charles (Stuart Smith) is annointed &quot;Leader of the Red 
   Ninjas&quot; by his dying master and is put in charge of returning a 
   mystical statue called the &quot;Black Ninja Warrior&quot; that 
   Victor stole. So begins another one of director Godfrey Ho's 
   hilarious cut-and-paste martial arts flicks, which mixes newly-shot 
   footage with some Thailand action film. The old footage concerns a 
   guy named Jimmy (Sorapong Chatri), who is out to take revenge of the 
   murder of his father (when he was a child) by a man known to everyone 
   as &quot;Boss&quot; (his name is really Roger). Jimmy practices 
   martial arts every day with his uncle, until they both think he is 
   ready to defeat the Boss. Jimmy's mission also has a second agenda: 
   He must also find his long-lost brother Johnny and unknown sister, 
   both whom he became separated from when their father was murdered. 
   Also in town are two mysterious <A HREF="ultimate_ninja_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ultimate ninja vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>strangers,
    who show an interest in the Boss as well as Eagle, the town's kung 
   fu teacher who supplies trained men for the Boss. Meanwhile, Charles 
   is practicing the &quot;supreme power of the Golden Ninja&quot; (it 
   has something to do with joining two pieces of a golden statue 
   together with nothing but the power of his mind), while fighting 
   members of Victor's black-clad ninja gang every twenty minutes or so. 
   Back in town, Johnny gets fired from his job waiting tables and asks 
   Sarah, Eagle's daughter, to teach him martial arts. It's at this time 
   we learn that Sarah is Eagle's adopted daughter and is actually 
   Johnny's sister. The finale finds Jimmy, Johnny and Sarah facing off 
   against the Boss and his men (the Boss carries one big-ass axe!) and 
   Jimmy kills the Boss (The Boss says to Jimmy while he's lying there 
   dying, &quot;It's OK. I know you killed me now!&quot;) while Charles 
   and Victor fight each other at Devil's Valley (it looks like a public 
   park), using swords and various other weapons that could only exist 
   in the screenwriter's (in this case it's Godfrey Ho) fertile 
   imagination. Charles gets the better of Victor as he does a backflip 
   off a picnic table!&nbsp; The entertainment value in pastiche films 
   like <B><A HREF="ultimate_ninja_1986c.htm">THE ULTIMATE NINJA</A></B> 
   comes not from the story and acting, but rather from the goofy 
   visuals of the newly-shot footage mixed with the hilarious new 
   dubbing over the old footage, usually done by British or Australian 
   voice talent, and this film (produced by Joseph Lai and Betty Chan 
   for their IFD Films &amp; Arts Ltd. production company) doesn't 
   disappoint. It's pretty disconcerting to hear such lines as: &quot;Why
    are you such a klutz?&quot;, &quot;See ya, big boy!&quot; and 
   &quot;We're gonna kick your ass and blow you outta town!&quot; coming 
   out of the Asian actors' mouths (Klutz? I know Jews like Chinese 
   food, but would they travel to China to get it? I think not.). The 
   new footage shows Charles wearing a headband with the word 
   &quot;Ninja&quot; written on it (a sight in most of these films), 
   while the bad guys wear headbands with skulls on them, so we don't 
   confuse them with a local Boy Scout troop. Some of the highlights 
   include Charles throwing a letter up in the air and slicing it with 
   his sword repeatedly until confetti falls like snow, The Boss' wife 
   saying to him, &quot;Roger, you hurt bad?&quot; when he has two huge 
   knives sticking out of his stomach and the final fight between 
   Charles and Victor, which is a series of sped-up and reversed 
   footage. Co-star Bruce Baron recently said in an interview that all 
   of the Caucasian actors never knew that the footage they shot would 
   appear in multiple films, as they were all paid to only star in one 
   film. Baron sarcastically calls the team of Godfrey Ho and Joseph Lai 
   by the term &quot;Whore and Lies&quot;. He's very bitter about being 
   tricked into starring in all these films. I guess I would be, too, if 
   I didn't find these films to be such an unintentional hoot. Also 
   starring Anne Aswatep, Pedro Ernyes, Timothy Nugent, Rick Jenkins,

   - 1986), he turns around and makes highly enjoyable sleaze like this. 
   When Anna (Emille Davazac) leaves her abusive husband, martial arts 
   champion Stingray (the amazing Don Niam and his mullet of doom), he 
   becomes a serial killing madman, kidnapping and killing every woman 
   he sees (thinki<A HREF="undefeatable_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/undefeatable vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ng
    she is Anna) and also killing the men they are with. His preferred 
   method of death is a snapped neck with a side order of eye-yanking. 
   When Stingray kills college student Karen (Sunny David), her sister, 
   waitress and underground fighter Kristi Jones (Cynthia Rothrock), 
   goes on the warpath looking for the person responsible. Kristi begins 
   getting into fights with every man she meets, looking for the killer, 
   which pisses off cop Nick DiMarco (John Miller), who is also looking 
   for the serial killer. After much fighting between themselves, Kristi 
   and Nick join forces. They get a break when they talk to Anna's 
   psychiatrist, Dr. Jennifer Simmons (Donna Jason), who tells them of a 
   client she has who has an abusive husband that is a martial artist. 
   The rest of the film is a series of fights between Kristi and some 
   underground fighters, Stingray and everyone he thinks is Anna and 
   cumulates in a truly amazing finale where Kristi and Nick fight 
   Stingray in a warehouse. Storywise, this isn't much of a film, but 
   the action and fights scenes in this are unbelievable. Godfrey Ho 
   (here usung the pseudonym &quot;Godfrey Hall&quot;) fills the screen 
   with non-stop carnage, including a fishtank full of eyeballs, a naked 
   woman stuffed in a freezer and Don Niam's bug-eyed performance as 
   Stingray. I guarantee that his acting ability will leave you in 
   stitches, as he spouts lines like, &quot;Don't leave me Mommy. I'll 
   be a good boy!&quot; and &quot;Time to come home now, Anna!&quot;. I 
   also love how everyone in this film knows martial arts, even the 
   psychiatrist! Cynthia Rothrock gets to show off her nimble body and 
   skills in several martial arts scenes and John Miller (who also 
   starred with Rothrock in Ho's <B><A HREF="honor_and_glory_1992.htm">HONOR
    AND GLORY</A></B> - 1992) does the best he can with his role as a 
   high-kicking cop. Ho saves the best for last, though, in the 
   warehouse finale. After viewing it, if you're not laughing your ass 
   off, you don't have a pulse. Nick's final line in the warehouse fight 
   is a classic of hysterical proportions. If you like a film full of 
   good stunts, bad acting and some of the funniest dialogue you'll ever 
   hear, this is the film is for you. Also starring Ricky Yuen, Jerald 
   Klein, Michael Walter and William Buckley. A Fox Home Entertainment
