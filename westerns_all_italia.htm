    a Western section after all these years? Why not? I finally realized 
   after watching plenty of Italian and Spanish westerns (dubbed 
   &quot;Spaghetti Westerns&quot;, which actually describes most 
   European Westerns made during the '60s to the '80s) that they were 
   basically horror films in a Western setting. Think about that for a 
   moment. Both genres have bad guys killing innocent people. Both 
   contain extreme violence and nudity (at least the good ones) and they 
   are all watchable from beginning to end. Spaghetti Westerns are much 
   different than American Westerns because of one distinct reason: Many 
   of them were directed by people who would then go into making or 
   starring in horror and giallo films, my two favorite genres of films. 
   People like Lucio Fulci (ZOMBIE - 1979), Sergio Martino (TORSO - 
   1973), Dario Argento (THE CAT O' NINE TAILS - 1971), Mario Bava (A 
   BAY OF BLOOD - 1971) and many other Italian greats got their start or 
   worked in the Spaghetti Western genre, putting their own unique spin 
   on them, making it an important category for me to review after all 
   these years. So sit back, try to relax and read my reviews of the 
   strangest Westerns out there. If you're not a fan (and why not?), I 
   guarantee you will be after reading some of the reviews. (</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">This

   Margheriti thinking he could do better, but in any case he turned out 
   a completely enjoyable film that is full of action and mystery that

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with a prison chain gang working in a quarry, turning 
   boulders into gravel. A prisoner moves a boulder and there's a 
   rattlesnake underneath it. He turns to prisoner Gary Hamilton (Klaus 
   Kinski; <B><A HREF="barrel_full_of_dollars_1971.htm">A BARREL FULL OF DOLLARS</A></B> 
   - 1971; he also appeared in Margheriti's <B><A HREF="#StrangerGunfight74">THE
    STRANGER AND THE GUNFIGHTER</A></B> - 1974) and says, &quot;Gary, 
   here's one way out of this place&quot;, but Gary kills the snake with 
   his shovel and says, &quot;That's not the way I wanna go. Not 
   yet.&quot; A squad of Union soldiers enters the quarry and call out 
   Gary's name. When he replies, they break the chain that imprisons him 
   and the warden tells him that he has been pardoned, saying to him 
   that it will make sense when he reads the letter addressed to him. It 
   says: &quot;By the existence on an amendment which considers amnesty 
   for political offenders and taking into consideration your past 
   military merits, I, therefore, on behalf of the President of the 
   United States, hereby declare by virtue of the above mentioned 
   amendment your sentence commuted and order your immediate release. 
   And so, therefore, you are a free man.&quot; While the other 
   prisoners walk back to their cells, Gary gets his first taste of 
   freedom in ten years, as he arrives in the town close to the prison 
   and notices the changes it has gone through in the past decade. He 
   then hops on a stagecoach and heads west. The passengers on the 
   stagecoach include West Point cadet Dick Acombar (Antonio Cantafora; <B><A HREF="shoot_joe_and_shoot_again_1971.htm">SHOOT
    JOE, AND SHOOT AGAIN</A></B> - 1971), who tells a pretty female 
   passenger that he hopes someday to get married so his wife could run 
   his life (!). She asks him why he doesn't try that now and Dick says 
   that his father owns the Craten Mines and &quot;he has a lot of plans 
   for me, so I suppose I won't have much choice.&quot; The girl's 
   mother says she always thought Mr. Acombar was a bachelor and Dick 
   corrects her, saying his father is a widower, he lost his mother when 
   he was five years old. Dick and the young woman make google eyes at 
   each other, so you know romance may be on the horizon, but why does 
   Gary's eyes get wider when Acombar family name is mentioned? The 
   stagecoach then stops in the middle of nowhere, the driver telling 
   Gary this is where he told him to drop him off. As Gary gets out of 
   the stagecoach, he looks at Dick and says. &quot;You tell your father 
   Gary Hamilton's back in town and I'll see him at sundown.&quot; Is 
   Mr. Acombar the reason why Gary spent the last ten years in prison?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gary walks to the nearest ranch and hands an old man ten dollars for 
   a horse, a rifle and ammunition. That old timer (Franco Gula; <B><A HREF="colt_in_the_hand_of_the_devil_1967.htm">COLT
    IN THE HAND OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1967) turns out to be Gary's 
   father and he hands Gary his favorite Springfield rifle, telling him 
   he was taking care of it until he returned. He also tells Gary that a 
   tornado is coming and it will touch down around sundown. We are then 
   in town as the stagecoach arrives and Mr. Acombar's foreman, 
   Francesco (&quot;Alan Collins&quot;; real name: Luciano Pigozzi; 
   Margheriti's <B><A HREF="vengeance_1968.htm">VENGEANCE</A></B> - 
   1968) welcomes Dick back to town, bringing him to his father's ranch 
   (When we first see Mr. Acombar [Peter Carsten; Margheriti's <B><A HREF="squeeze_1978.htm">THE
    SQUEEZE</A></B> - 1978], he is shooting toy soldiers off a shelf in 
   his private firing range). Dick's father is happy to see him back 
   home, but he couldn't have come at a worse time, because everyone on 
   the ranch and in town are getting prepared for the tornado, which 
   everyone believes will be the worse tornado this territory have ever 
   witnessed (We see saloon worker Joe [Luigi &quot;Gigi&quot; Bonos; <B><A HREF="sartanas_here_trade_your_pistol_for_a_coffin_1970.htm">SARTANA'S
    HERE</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="sartanas_here_trade_your_pistol_for_a_coffin_1970.htm">...</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="sartanas_here_trade_your_pistol_for_a_coffin_1970.htm">TRADE
    YOUR PISTOL FOR A COFFIN</A></B> - 1970] walking into the saloon 
   with a mattress on his back. He tells Francesco that the mattress is 
   to be used to protect the bottles of booze, because the saloon's 
   walls may come crashing down and the roof may fly away, but at least 
   the booze will be safe!). Mr. Acombar brings Dick to the house to 
   greet his stepmother Mary (Marcella Michelangeli; <B><A HREF="arizona_colt_returns_1970.htm">ARIZONA
    COLT RETURNS</A></B> - 1970) and she is more than happy to see him, 
   but when Dick delivers Gary's message and mentions his name, the room 
   goes eerily quiet and everyone hears a flock of birds fly overhead, 
   Mr. Acombar telling Dick that they are birds of prey leaving the area 
   to avoid the approaching tornado (Dick hands his father Gary's 
   canteen, which he left on the stagecoach, telling his father he can 
   give it back to Gary when he comes to visit him at sundown, not 
   knowing that Gary's message was actually a threat). When Mary shows 
   Dick to his room, Miguel (&quot;Lee Burton&quot;; real name: Guido 
   Lollobrigida; <B><A HREF="roy_colt_and_winchester_jack_1970.htm">ROY 
   COLT &amp; WINCHESTER JACK</A></B> - 1970), Francesco's brother, says 
   to Mr. Acombar that he thought Gary was in prison for life, Mr. 
   Acombar replying that he must have escaped (Notice how they are in a 
   room of mirrors and how hard it must have been to shoot this scene). 
   He tells Miguel to kill Gary before he gets to the ranch and to make 
   sure Dick hears nothing about it, not wanting his son to know that he 
   is a very bad man (He hopes that some day Dick will become Governor 
   or even President). Mary comes back into the room and says, &quot;A 
   ghost returns and he'll have only one desire in his heart, only one 
   thirst, revenge!&quot; She tells her husband that Dick asked her if 
   she knew Gary Hamilton, but she lied and said no. She then says that 
   she really didn't get to know Gary, she only had enough time to 
   betray him. Mr. Acombar grabs Mary and says, &quot;Let's keep it that 
   way, you didn't know him, get it? Dick must never know! Anyway, 
   Hamilton will never get in here alive!&quot; As soon as he finishes 
   that statement, a gust of wind blows a window open. Is this a portend 
   of things to come?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see about twenty of Mr. Acombar's hired guns walking down 
   Main Street, their hands on their holsters, scaring the residents who 
   are tornado-proofing their businesses. About the only one not scared 
   is Dr. Jonathan (Giuliano Raffaelli; <B><A HREF="sugar_colt_1966.htm">SUGAR
    COLT</A></B> - 1966), who tells the judge (Joaquin Blanco; <B><A HREF="god_forgives_i_dont_1967.htm">GOD
    FORGIVES</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="god_forgives_i_dont_1967.htm">...</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="god_forgives_i_dont_1967.htm">I
    DON'T</A></B> - 1967), &quot;Whoever's comin' is going to get a 
   rowdy welcome!&quot; He jokes to Rosy (Maria Luisa Sala; <B><A HREF="#PriceOfPower1969">THE
    PRICE OF POWER</A></B> - 1969), the saloon owner, that he believes 
   Mr. Acombar could scare the wind away. The gunslingers wait on the 
   outskirt of town to ambush Gary. They see him in the distance riding 
   into town, but when he is about a hundred yards away, the wind blows 
   sand into their faces and after that, all they see is Gary's 
   horse...without Gary on it. The men start to wonder if Gary is a 
   ghost, but there is a more pressing matter to consider. The wind is 
   getting stronger and the tornado is only a few minutes away, so all 
   the men group at Acombar's ranch to wait for Gary to arrive, 
   wondering which one of them is going to get Mr. Acombar's $10,000 
   reward for killing him. We then see that Gary is in a cave that is 
   connected to the town's well. The cave leads to an Indian graveyard 
   and Gary shoots an Indian who tries to sneak up behind him, killing 
   him (He wasn't even a member of Acombar's gang, he just wanted the reward).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As the wind picks up intensity, the church bell begins to ring, but 
   it shouldn't because it was secured for the tornado. The constant 
   ringing of the bell begins to get on everyone's nerves, but the gang 
   begins to realize they are being picked off one by one and the church 
   bell clanging is masking the killer's gunshots. The first member of 
   the gang to be killed is Jim (Lucio De Santis; <B><A HREF="texas_adios_1966.htm">TEXAS,
    ADIOS</A></B> - 1966), a nice round bullet hole between his eyes. 
   They bring Jim's body into the church and ask the priest (Marco 
   Morelli; <B><A HREF="taste_of_vengeance_1969.htm">TASTE OF VENGEANCE</A></B> 
   - 1969) who is ringing the bell, but he doesn't answer. Francesco 
   says it must be Gary because he doesn't believe in ghosts and when 
   the gang leave the church, Gary appears and he tells the priest that 
   he will pay for his sins, especially those he committed against him 
   and he doesn't care if God forgives him or not. At dinner, Dick can 
   see there is something wrong with his family, especially when his 
   father tells him to ignore all the gunfire outside because it is 
   drunks letting off steam (really?). We then find out that Dr. 
   Jonathan is helping Gary (he removed the rock that was blocking the 
   cave in the well so Gary could jump off his horse and into it as he 
   was heading into town), but Gary tells him to wait in the saloon, it 
   is the only safe place in town (Rosy is also helping Gary).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next to die is Pedro (Osiride Pevarello; <B><A HREF="unholy_four_1970.htm">THE
    UNHOLY FOUR</A></B> - 1970), who was Francesco's best friend. Mr. 
   Acombar orders Francesco to stop the church bell from ringing and 
   when Francesco gets to the church steeple, he discovers that his 
   brother Miguel is hanging from his neck on the bell rope, yet when he 
   removes his dead brother from the rope, the bell continues ringing. 
   Is something supernatural actually going on or is Gary laying another 
   trap? Mr. Acombar, once again, orders Francesco to stop the damn bell 
   from ringing, only when he gets there, the heavy bell falls on 
   Francesco, killing him (Cutting him in half! At least the damn bell 
   stopped ringing!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dick goes looking for Gary without telling his father and he finds 
   him, asking Gary why he wants his father dead. Gary brings Dick into 
   the saloon and in front of Dr. Jonathan and Rosy, tells Dick all 
   about his father (a conversation the audience is not privy to). Mr. 
   Acombar goes looking for Dick and finds him, but Dick now looks at 
   his father in a<A HREF="and_god_said_to_cain_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/and god said to cain italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   different light, a much darker light. So what did Mr. Acombar and 
   Mary do to Gary? I'm afraid you will have to watch the film to 
   discover that tidbit (Hint: they're round, smooth and glitters in the light).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Though not as supernatural in tone as <B><A HREF="strangers_gundown_1969.htm">THE
    STRANGER'S GUNDOWN</A></B> (1969), the stories and situations are 
   strikingly similar, but in this film there are legitimate 
   explanations as to why Gary seems to be a ghost (He has help and 
   knows this town like the back of his hand because he grew up there), 
   unlike the other film, which is far more ambiguous. Just like Antonio 
   Margheriti's other numerous films, spanning many genres, this film is 
   better acted, photographed and has a professional gloss to it, 
   missing from most other low-budget Spaghetti Westerns. The 
   screenplay, by Margheriti and Giovanni Addessi (Margheriti's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#CastleOfBlood1964">CASTLE
    OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1964 and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WebSpider1971">WEB
    OF THE SPIDER</A></B> - 1971, as well as <B><A HREF="black_lemons_1970.htm">BLACK
    LEMONS</A></B> - 1970), is also above average, showing us that all 
   Gary had to do was make his presence felt, because the guilty parties 
   would soon implode and turn on each other (especially when the only 
   innocent Acombar turns up dead). There is never a boring moment in 
   this film, as Margheriti layers on the Gothic elements (including 
   Acombar's ranch burning down and the room of mirrors playing an 
   important role in the finale [Mirrors show your true face]). This is 
   because Margheriti was an old hand at Gothic horror films, helming 
   the previously mentioned <B><A HREF="castle_of_blood_1964.htm">CASTLE 
   OF BLOOD</A></B> (1964) and its remake <B><A HREF="web_of_the_spider_1971.htm">WEB

   and rides off into the woods, her hands still tied behind her back. 
   She runs into Tommy, who knocks her off the horse, unties her and 
   says he has to go to Fort Cobb, but he doesn't know the way, only the 
   squaw doesn't understand English. Keith shows up on horseback and 
   tries to kill the squaw, but Tommy knocks him out, stealing his boots 
   and gun. Frankie then shows up, so Tommy and the squaw run into the 
   woods and hide until Frankie and Keith give up looking for them. When 
   they are alone, the squaw tries to kill Tommy, so he grabs her and 
   says he had nothing to do with the massacre in her village, even 
   though she doesn't understand a single word he's saying. Tommy tells 
   her his name and she tells him hers (it's Sunsirahe), but Tommy says 
   that is a mouthful, he'll call her &quot;Apache&quot; instead (How 
   white of him!). It's not long before they become friends and, 
   eventually, lovers, as Tommy tries to may his way to Fort Cobb, but 
   it won't be easy, as the West holds danger for both the white man and Indians.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While walking, Tommy discovers his Confederate squadron dead, all 
   with arrows in their bodies. Tommy becomes very distrusting about 
   Indians, even Apache, but he changes his mind when Apache kills a 
   poisonous snake that was about to bite him. Over time, Tommy and 
   Apache begin to understand each other very well, without speaking to 
   each other, so much so, that Apache sleeps naked next to Tommy to 
   give him warmth on the cold nights. One morning, Tommy wakes up to 
   the sound of gunfire and when he goes to investigate, he finds Apache 
   tied spread-eagle between two trees, put there by Snake (Mario 
   Maranzana; <B><A HREF="long_ride_from_hell_1968.htm">A LONG RIDE FROM HELL</A></B> 
   - 1968), an Indian-hating man who talks about himself in the third 
   person (&quot;Snake ain't stupid. He's smart, very smart!&quot;). 
   Tommy has to pretend he doesn't know Apache so he can save her from 
   the clutches of Snake. He frees her that night and they both escape 
   from Snake, but barely.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Tommy gets close to Fort Cobb, he tells Apache that they will 
   have to go their separate ways because he can't bring an Indian into 
   an Army base and he doesn't want to be accused of being a deserter, 
   but the sad look on Apache's face changes his mind fairly quickly, 
   because he now has lovin' on his mind. He kisses Apache and she 
   laughs at him, showing Tommy the proper way Apache women kiss. Then 
   they have sex. A short time later, Tommy sees some soldiers in the 
   distance and he and Apache ride to them, only they are pinned down by 
   the Apache warriors. Tommy joins his brethren in a gunfight against 
   the warriors, only Apache stops him from killing any Indians. We soon 
   find out why. The leader of the warriors is her brother and when the 
   warriors kill all the soldiers, her brother tries to kill Tommy, but 
   Apache stops him, only to have him shot in the back and killed by a 
   barely-alive soldier. Later on, Tommy and Apache run into Preacher 
   Masters (Piero Mazzinghi, as &quot;Peter McSing&quot;; <B><A HREF="god_made_them_i_kill_them_1968.htm">GOD
    MADE THEM...I KILL THEM</A></B> - 1968) and his family, including 
   his beautiful daughter (Ely Galleani; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BabaYaga1973">BABA
    YAGA</A></B> - 1973), who makes Apache jealous. Masters, also an 
   Indian hater, tells Tommy that he is going to Fort Cobb and he would 
   be pleased if he joined them (&quot;It would be nice to have an extra 
   gun around.&quot;). He also tells Tommy that Fort Cobb is offering a 
   reward of ten silver dollars for any Indian they bring to the fort, 
   women and children included, dead or alive. This preacher may be a 
   man of God, but he's not a decent man (I have not yet met one that 
   was), as he quotes from the Bible to try to convince Tommy that 
   killing Indians is what God wants. Tommy's not buying it and goes to 
   leave, but the Preacher tells him Apache stays. A fight breaks out 
   between the Preacher's two sons and Tommy and Tommy is forced to 
   shoot and kill the Preacher's daughter when she tries to kill Apache. 
   Tommy now knows there is no way in hell he can bring Apache to Fort 
   Cobb, but what can he do? He considers himself a good soldier and 
   wants to do the right thing, but will the love of an Indian woman 
   trump being a dedicated soldier?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   and Frankie shoots Tommy, both in cold blood. As Tommy's body floats 
   down river, Frankie rapes a severely wounded Apache, only Tommy is 
   not dead. Can he save Apache before it's too late? Like many 
   Spaghetti Westerns, expect a downbeat, sad finale. Tommy shoots and 
   kills both Frankie and Keith and then impales Jeremy with a 
   pitchfork. As Tommy is burying Apache, a squad of soldiers arrive and 
   want to know if he has seen any &quot;stinking Indians&quot; around. 
   All Tommy can do is say no, as the squad rides to Fort Cobb. While 
   Tommy is praying at Apache's grave, he is shot dead by Preacher 
   Masters. Is there a moral to this story? Does it really matter?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   - 1987, just to mention a few), using the Anglicized pseudonym 
   &quot;George McRoots&quot;, is a fairly captivating tale about 
   hatred. Hatred for a race of people the white man doesn't try to 
   understand, not helped by the fact that the government has put a 
   price on their heads, thinking they must all be the same, no matter 
   if they are men, women or children. Now I don't want to get political 
   because it has no place in a film review, but I will say it is still 
   going on up to this day. This film portrays that hatred very well, as 
   every man (besides Tommy) has a racial hatred of Indians, even though 
   most of them have never laid eyes on a Indian their entire lives. 
   Full of nudity and some bloody violence, this film will entertain you 
   with its sleaze elements while making you feel uneasy by the way 
   people act here. This film is a success for that fact alone. I was 
   never a fan of Al Cliver's (real name: Pierluigi Conti) acting, 
   because I always found him vanilla and plain, but he's quite good 
   here because the story doesn't demand too much of him. Clara Hopf is 
   easy on the eyes, both in and out of her clothes. Even though this 
   film is low budget, it is still recommended.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Peter has vivid nightmares where a man dressed in all black tries to 
   kill him, as we discover when Peter was a child, he witnessed someone 
   dressed in black murdering his father and the killer was never 
   caught. Peter is also in love with Charly's daughter, the beautiful 
   Dolores (Pilar Velazquez; <B><A HREF="his_name_was_holy_ghost_1972.htm">HIS

   - 1969), a cruel big shot rancher who controls the water rights to 
   Charly's ranch. Charly and Johnny's father were best friends and 
   shared many adventures together and before he died, Johnny's father 
   promised Charly that he would always have water at his ranch, 
   something that Johnny holds over Charly's head, because without 
   water, the ranch couldn't survive. To make sure their ranch continues 
   getting water, Charly and Mary pimp-out their daughter to Johnny, 
   even though Dorothy thinks he is a pig and she can't stand to be with 
   him, because he is a sadistic man who slaps her around and is always 
   trying to get into her virginal panties. At the end of one of their 
   &quot;dates&quot;, Johnny takes Dorothy home and tries to rape her. 
   Dorothy puts up a fight and he slaps her, Peter seeing the whole 
   thing and challenging Johnny to a fight. Johnny proves to be a better 
   boxer than Johnny, beating the snot out of him. Charly and Mary hear 
   the commotion outside and go to investigate, while Johnny jumps on 
   his buggy and makes a veiled threat that he may have to divert the 
   water away from Charly's farm. Charly and Mary order their daughter 
   to do whatever Johnny wants, but Dorothy tells them she loves someone 
   else: Peter. The next morning, we see Peter shirtless, tied to the 
   ground while Charly whips him mercilessly, giving him fifty lashes 
   for daring to touch his daughter and telling him to leave the ranch 
   and never come back, he is fired. Peter then drowns his sorrows at 
   the local saloon, when Dorothy appears and tells Peter that she only 
   loves him and they should get married immediately. A judge marries 
   Peter and Dorothy in a quickie marriage, but Dorothy has to pay for 
   the ceremony because Peter is broke. The couple spends their 
   honeymoon in the judge's barn, both losing their virginity to each

   into the middle of the desert and drops his unconscious body in the 
   sand, leaving him there in the blazing sun, without any water or a

   (Telling Peter, &quot;Not a bounty killer...just a killer.&quot;) 
   who, for some reason, nurses Peter back to health. Peter notices that 
   Latimore look exactly like the black-clad figure in his nightmares 
   and wonders if he is the one who killed his father, yet Latimore, who 
   is after four wanted killers known as &quot;The Torturers&quot; 
   (Latimore doesn't seem interested in the bounty, as we discover 
   later), teaches Peter how to be a man and to stand up for himself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see The Torturers, led by Larry (Frank Brana; <B><A HREF="#KillPokerPlayer1972">KILL
    THE POKER PLAYER</A></B> - 1972), enter a town that seems to be 
   deserted. They see a yellow flag hanging from the church and Larry 
   tells them that means that the town has been hit by the Plague. The 
   other men don't believe him and start firing their guns in the air to 
   wake up the residents. What happens next is totally surreal and very 
   creepy, so creepy, it will send chills up your spine. As the gang are 
   firing their pistols into the air, they are surrounded by 
   Plague-infected residents who act like zombies, only instead of 
   yelling &quot;Brrraaaiiinnss!&quot;, they yell &quot;Waaateerrr!&quot;
    and slowly approach the gang from all sides, forcing them to shoot 
   and kill all of them. Instead of leaving town, like Larry wants to 
   do, his compadres decide to rob the deserted bank, steal jewelry and 
   cash from all the residents' homes and booze it up with all the free 
   liquor in the bartender-less saloon. Larry agrees to stay the night, 
   but tells the rest of them that he is leaving in the morning because 
   he believes Latimore is not far behind them. The next morning, while 
   Larry is saddling his horse and getting ready to leave this 
   Plague-infested town, Latimore shows up and guns down the other 
   three, getting the drop on Larry in the progress. Peter, who 
   witnesses the whole thing, leaves the town with Latimore, as we hear 
   Larry screaming in the background. We soon discover why: Latimore 
   tied Larry up to a Plague-infected corpse, leaving him there to 
   literally rot to death (And also telling us all we need to know about 
   Latimore's character. He's not in it for the money, he just likes to kill).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Latimore and Peter ride into the next town and go to the saloon, 
   where two men tell Peter to get out of their bar, giving him a count 
   of three to leave. Peter, who now has a new sense of courage and is 
   wearing a gun, tells the two men to make him leave, forcing Latimore 
   to kill them when they draw down on Peter, but Peter is shot in the 
   stomach and passes out. When he awakens, Peter discovers he is in a 
   cabin owned by elderly Chinese man Chang (Gene Reyes; the mummy in <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#AssignmentTerror69">ASSIGNMENT
    TERROR</A></B> - 1969), brought there by Latimore. We then discover 
   that Chang was Latimore's teacher, giving him all the skills he 
   needed to become a world-class killer. When Peter admires Chang's 
   collection of pistols hanging on a wall, he tells Peter that 
   &quot;Guns are history. Every gun has a story.&quot; Peter wants to 
   know if he has the hands to become an expert with a gun and when 
   Chang looks at and touches his hands, only one word comes out of his 
   mouth: &quot;Clumsy.&quot; Chang uses ancient Chinese medicine and 
   other techniques to turn Peter's hands into those of an expert 
   marksman and pistol shooter and after over a year of training 
   (pre-dating the &quot;80s montage&quot; sequences), Peter is ready to 
   leave, vowing to return to his wife and to exact revenge on those who 
   did him and Dorothy wrong.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then discover that Dorothy is now a prostitute working at the 
   local whorehouse where, for ten dollars, any man can spend the night 
   with her. Her current recurring client is Ted, who tells her that she 
   should really lower her price because she's not that good. Dorothy 
   ask Ted if she will see him the same time next week and he tells her 
   no, he is leaving town for good tomorrow. Peter, who is now dressed 
   all in black, arrives in his hometown and the first thing he does is 
   go the Charly's ranch, whipping Charly as mercilessly as he whipped 
   him and making Mary watch. We then watch Ted hopping onto the caboose 
   of a departing train, only he'll be arriving at his destination dead, 
   as Peter guns him down while standing at the train station. The 
   bounty on Peter's head grows, from $1,000 to $2,000 and, finally 
   $5,000, as he kills all those (including Johnny) who wronged him and 
   Dorothy. He also reconnects with Dorothy and they settle down to a 
   &quot;normal&quot; life of man and wife at a little ranch of their 
   own. But their happiness is shattered by Latimore, who shows Dorothy 
   the $5,000 bounty reward poster for Peter, dead or alive, but does he 
   really want the money or is he looking to discover who is better with 
   a gun, him or Peter? He challenges Peter to a showdown. Shots ring 
   out and we see Latimore fall to the ground, dead. Dorothy then hugs 
   Peter, only to discover he is mortally wounded, dying in his wife's 
   arms. In a gunfight, only the gun wins, not the person who is pulling 
   the trigger. Peter should have listened to Chang and used his 
   newfound skills for good rather than for revenge.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   them, but they gun them down instead, stealing jewelry and money from 
   their homes. German actor Peter Lee Lawrence is also very good as a 
   timid man who has a major change in attitude, thanks to Chang and 
   Latimore, but instead of using his new skills for good, he decides to 
   use them for retribution and pays the price for it, learning that 
   death only brings on more death. So, is Latimore Peter's father's 
   killer? It is not stated directly in the film (and Latimore denies 
   it), but we also learn that killers are also liars, so anything is 
   possible, but the choice is yours to make. Peter Lee Lawrence was a

    Shot as <B><A HREF="awkward_hands_1970.htm">MANOS TORPES</A></B> 
   (&quot;Clumsy Hands&quot;, an alternate title for the film), this 
   film is not as easy to find as many other Spaghetti Westerns, as it 
   has never been issued on home video in any physical form, not even as 
   part of any DVD compilation in the United States. I received a DVD-R 
   from a friend in Greece that was a rip of a Greek VHS tape, but I 
   managed to find an anamorphic widescreen print streaming on Amazon 
   Prime. Unlike their other Spaghetti Westerns, the print is far from 
   perfect, showing lots of noise in some of the indoor scenes and some 
   jumps in the print, but it is not enough for me to say not to watch 
   it if you are a Prime member (If you're not, it will cost you $1.99 
   to view it). This is one all fans of the genre should watch, if only 
   for Peter Lee Lawrence's wonderful performance and the surreal 
   sequence in the Plague-ridden town. Also starring Antonio Casas (<B><A HREF="#PriceOfPower1969">THE

   James Webb (Klaus Kinski; <B><A HREF="great_silence_1968.htm">THE 
   GREAT SILENCE</A></B> - 1968) rides into the town of Tombstone, 
   Texas, a second horse behind him carrying dozens of his law books, 
   the residents of this fairly new town mistakenly believe he is a 
   Federal Investigator sent by the U.S. government to clean up lawless 
   Tombstone. It is lawless mainly due to the O'Hara brothers, a Mexican 
   (!) family who have already murdered eight sheriffs and are about to 
   murder number<A HREF="black_killer_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black killer spain dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   nine, thanks to Webb (One resident says to Webb, &quot;We have three 
   undertakers, but only one preacher.&quot;). What the residents don't 
   know is that James Webb is a puppet master, working in the 
   background, peeping through windows and behind curtains and doors, to 
   make Tombstone a town where everyone can feel safe, using the law 
   against crooked Judge Wilson (Dante Maggio, as &quot;Don May&quot;; <B><A HREF="#FightingFistJoe1973">THE
    FIGHTING FIST OF SHANGHAI JOE</A></B> - 1973), who pretends to be on 
   the side of the law, but is actually working in conjunction with the 
   O'Hara brothers to steal peoples' land by making them sign over the 
   deeds and then killing them in cold blood. But is this actually 
   Webb's plan or does he have other motives for doing it?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We soon find out that Webb's law books aren't for readin', they're 
   actually hollowed out to hold his collection of pistols and 
   derringers, which he fires by pulling a string that are attached to 
   the triggers! That day, Webb watches out his hotel window as the 
   O'Hara brothers ride into town and murder the Donovan family (Webb 
   secretly shoots two members of the O'Hara's using two of his 
   &quot;book guns&quot;). The O'Hara brothers, led by Pedro (Enzo 
   Pulcrano, as &quot;Paul Craine&quot;; <B><A HREF="brother_outlaw_1971.htm">BROTHER
    OUTLAW</A></B> - 1971), then ride to the Donovan homestead and make 
   the father sign the deed to the land over to them. When he does, 
   Pedro and his brothers shoot him and the remainder of the Donovans, 
   killing them in cold blood. Meanwhile, Webb goes to Judge Wilson 
   (Earlier, the Judge made the O'Hara brothers sign a piece of paper 
   turning over all the deeds to him if they should all should die, even 
   though none of them can read or write, the brothers signing with an 
   &quot;X&quot;!) and uses the law to make him put a $10,000 bounty on 
   Pedro's head for the murder of the Donovan family, knowing full well 
   that this will cause the death of the current sheriff. Sure enough, 
   when Pedro learns about the bounty on his head (He thinks the amount 
   is too low!), he and his brothers ride into town (after callously 
   shooting and killing the elderly Federal Inspector, to stop him from 
   entering Tombstone, stealing his pocket watch in the process!), throw 
   a stick of dynamite into the sheriff's office and when he walks out 
   in a daze, they tie him up spread-eagle and then shoot him dead, 
   putting Pedro's wanted poster on his body, which Pedro makes sure 
   doesn't fall off him by throwing two of his sharp knives into the 
   poster, impaling the dead sheriff's chest (talk about overkill!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Webb goes to Judge Wilson once again and uses the law to make him 
   hire a new sheriff by tomorrow morning. The Judge tells him that will 
   be next to impossible, because Tombstone has gone through nine 
   sheriffs in the past two months and no resident will take the 
   position (The Judge asks Deputy Fred [director Carlo Croccolo] if he 
   wants the job and he says no, concluding with &quot;More pay, free 
   room and board and a five minute future!&quot;). Webb doesn't want to 
   hear it, telling the Judge he has one day to hire a new sheriff. When 
   the Judge threatens to quit, Webb reminds him that the law states 
   that he must give 30 days notice to relinquish his position, so the 
   judge has no choice but to find a new sheriff in 24 hours.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Luckily (?) for the Judge, former resident Bud Collins (Fred 
   Robsahm; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SoYoungVicious1975">SO 
   YOUNG, SO LOVELY, SO VICIOUS...</A></B> - 1975) rides into town, goes 
   to the saloon and asks where he can find his brother Peter (Gerardo 
   Rossi, as &quot;Jerry Ross&quot;; <B><A HREF="colt_in_the_hand_of_the_devil_1967.htm">COLT
    IN THE HAND OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1967). Prostitute Consuelo 
   (Tiziana Dini; <B><A HREF="bounty_killer_for_trinity_1972.htm">A 
   BOUNTY KILLER FOR TRINITY</A></B> - 1972) tells him that Peter lost 
   the family home to the O'Hara brothers, but he built a house next to 
   the lake and married an Indian girl named Sarah (Marina Malfatti, as 
   &quot;Marina Mulligan&quot;; <B><A HREF="theres_a_noose_waiting_for_you_trinity_1972.htm">THERE'S
    A NOOSE WAITING FOR YOU...TRINITY!</A></B> - 1972). While playing 
   cards with the locals, Bud is accused of cheating by Ryan O'Hara 
   (Antonio Danesi, as &quot;Robert Danish&quot;; <B><A HREF="sartanas_here_trade_your_pistol_for_a_coffin_1970.htm">SARTANA'S
    HERE...TRADE YOUR PISTOL FOR A COFFIN</A></B> - 1970), which results 
   in Bud shooting and killing two O'Hara brothers and bashing Ryan in 
   the head with the butt of his gun. All this is brought on with the 
   influence of Ramon O'Hara (Antonio Cantafora; <B><A HREF="#AndGodCain1970">AND
    GOD SAID TO CAIN</A></B> - 1970), who runs the saloon/hotel in 
   Tombstone and reporting to his brothers (there sure are a lot of 
   'em!) what is going down in the town of Tombstone, so they are kept 
   up to date. Judge Wilson has Deputy Fred arrest Bud, telling him he 
   can either spend the rest of his life in prison doing hard labor or 
   he can become Tombstone's new sheriff. After telling the Judge that 
   he shot the men in self-defense and getting nowhere, Bud accepts the 
   Judge's proposal, especially when he give him $5,000 and says he will 
   get $5,000 more when the O'Hara brothers are dead. Bud becomes 
   Tombstone's new sheriff and Webb then offers him a deal: 50% of the 
   illegally obtained land if he plays his cards straight (We never hear 
   the complete deal, as it is supposed to be a surprise).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Sarah trying to teach Peter how to shoot a bow, but he's 
   a lousy shot (she, on the other hand, is an expert). It is obvious 
   that they are very much in love, even though the town of Tombstone 
   refuses to accept a white man being married to an Indian (I'm still 
   trying to figure out what tribe would name her Sarah!). Bud pays his 
   brother and new wife a visit and tells Peter he is a lucky man to be 
   married to such a beautiful woman. He also tells Peter since he is 
   sheriff, he will get their family home and land back from the O'Hara 
   brothers. Thanks to Ramon, the O'Hara brothers ride to Peter house to 
   kill Bud. Once they arrive at the house, they beat-up and knock out 
   Bud and gang rape Sarah, forcing a tied-up Peter to watch. When Peter 
   tries to intervene, Ryan and Miguel O'Hara (Calogero Caruana, as 
   &quot;Ted Jones&quot;; <B><A HREF="vengeance_1968.htm">VENGEANCE</A></B> 
   - 1968) shoot and kill Peter, set fire to the house and leave Sarah 
   and Bud inside to burn to death. Bud and Sarah manage to escape and 
   now both of them have good reason to see the O'Hara brothers dead, 
   Sarah using her bow and Bud his pistols.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We see the O'Hara brother celebrating the death of the new sheriff 
   in the saloon, beating the crap out of a midget (!) for getting too 
   handy with one of their whores (The midget hits one of the brothers 
   over and over, yelling &quot;Mine! Mine! Mine!&quot; in a dubbed 
   child's voice!) and acting like they just won the lottery. Webb keeps 
   a close eye on what is happening in town and picks the right moment 
   to rifle through Judge Wilson's desk and crack open his safe, finding 
   the illegally obtained deeds and the paper the O'Hara's signed. When 
   Sarah kills Slide O'Hara (Domenico Maggio, as &quot;Dick Foster&quot;;
    <B><A HREF="shoot_the_living_and_pray_for_the_dead_1971.htm">SHOOT 
   THE LIVING AND PRAY FOR THE DEAD</A></B> - 1971) with her bow, Pedro 
   yells out, &quot;We got to get those baaaastaaaards!&quot;, but Webb 
   tells him that he saw Bud and Sarah ride out of town (they didn't). 
   Ryan kidnaps Consuelo and brings her to the O'Hara fort. Miguel whips 
   her to make her talk about where Bud is, but she refuses to say 
   anything (earlier, they murdered one of her prostitute friends). Bud 
   and Sarah begin picking off the O'Hara brothers one at a time at the 
   fort. Ryan tries to rape Consuelo, only to have Bud interrupt him, 
   offering Ryan something he never gave him: a fair fight. Of course, 
   Ryan cheats, forcing Bud to kill him, but Consuelo is shot dead in 
   the process. Sarah is shot in the ass, forcing Bud to dig out the 
   bullet with his knife, where he is surprised by Sarah not crying out 
   in pain, she telling him, &quot;We learn to endure pain.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bud and Sarah lay siege to the O'Hara fort, killing many of their 
   members (one shot through the neck with an arrow). When the gang sees 
   how many of their members are dead, they leave the fort en mass like 
   cowards, leaving the O'Hara brothers to fend for themselves, but they 
   all end up dead. Back in Tombstone, Webb confronts Judge Wilson about 
   his illegal activities and makes him sign all the deeds over to him. 
   Webb then murders the Judge with a couple of his book guns, stealing 
   everything in his safe. Sarah then shows up in Webb's hotel room, gun 
   drawn, telling him that Bud said to make sure he didn't leave town. 
   Bud then enters the saloon and gets into a fight with Ramon, while 
   Webb overpowers Sarah, tying her up and then helping Bud kill the 
   remaining O'Hara brothers. All the O'Hara brothers are now dead and 
   Webb hands Bud his family's deed, but Bud arrests Webb for the murder 
   of Judge Wilson, telling Sarah and the relieved Tombstone townsfolk 
   that he is handing Webb over to a judge in Carson City. But is he 
   really? It turns out he isn't and then we are hit with a revelation 
   that is very hard to swallow. <B>Warning! DO NOT READ if you don't 
   want to be pissed off!</B> It turns out Bud was working with James 
   Webb from the beginning, not to get the deeds back to their rightful 
   owners (that was just a side benefit), but to split the money in the 
   safe with Webb 50/50! If you think too hard about it, all the 
   killings, including that of Peter and Consuelo, could have been 
   avoided if Bud would have just minded his own damn business. Webb 
   calls Bud a &quot;bastard&quot; during the final scene and Bud turns 
   to him and says, &quot;Yeah, that's what my father use to call 
   me.&quot; The End. WTF?!? <B>END OF THE PISSED OFF ZONE!!!</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is a pretty standard Spaghetti Western, Webb's method of 
   killing and the unbelievably stupid conclusion notwithstanding. Throughout<A HREF="black_killer_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black killer german dvd front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the film, even when they are alone with each other, Bud and Webb talk 
   to each other as if they were total strangers, so when it is revealed 
   that they are actually working together, it is not only a cheat on 
   the audience, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.&nbsp; 
   Describing Bud as a &quot;bastard&quot; is an understatement, as he 
   is not only responsible for his brother's death, he's culpable for 
   every murder since when he was appointed sheriff. He's worse than a 
   bastard, he's a mutherfuckin' bastard! I doubt that was director/co-screen
    writer Carlo Croccolo's (using the pseudonym &quot;Lucky Moore&quot;)
    intention, but it sure comes across that way. This was only one of 
   two films Croccolo directed, as he was an actor by trade. His other 
   film, the Spaghetti Western <B><A HREF="gunman_of_one_hundred_crosses_1971.htm">GUNMAN
    OF ONE HUNDRED CROSSES</A></B> (1971), was filmed back-to-back with 
   this one and, based on this film, I have no intention of viewing it. 
   While there is some nice nudity, by both Marina Malfatti and Tiziana 
   Dini, as well as some nasty violence (Pedro throwing the knives in 
   the dead sheriff's chest; various arrow impalements, etc.), the fact 
   that this film ends on such a sour and unbelievable note will have 
   you forgetting any of the good points this film has to offer. Not 
   that there are many to begin with. Like most of Klaus Kinski's 
   Spaghetti Westerns (and there are many!), he is horrendously dubbed 
   here, sounding like a Rhodes scholar rather than is usual gravel 
   voice. Fred Robsahm's acting can be politely described as one note, 
   as he has the same look on his face when he is killing someone as he 
   does when seducing someone. Making the O'Hara's Mexican also pushes 
   the believability factor to new heights and it never even tries to 
   explain why Ryan is the only non-Mexican brother. Was he adopted or 
   did they kill his father? He stands out like a grain of salt in a 
   mountain of pepper. It's best that you skip this film, as there are 
   far better Spaghetti Westerns out there to waste your precious time 
   on. I was expecting a much better film since it was co-written by 
   Luigi Angelo, who wrote or co-wrote the screenplays to the 
   above-average giallo film <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE 
   SLASHER...IS THE SEX MANIAC!</A></B> (1972) and the Lola Falana 
   western <B><A HREF="black_tigress_1967.htm">LOLA COLT</A></B> (1967),

   bagpipe-playing Preacher (Lewis Gordon; <B><A HREF="crystalstone_1987.htm">CRYSTALSTONE</A></B> 
   - 1987) in a confessional, the Preacher telling him that this is a 
   ghost town because two evil brothers came here and murdered all the 
   men and children, kidnapping all the pretty women. Hart tells him 
   about the Thompson brothers, so the Preacher joins him on his quest. 
   We then see that the kidnapped women are being held captive in a 
   rundown church, where they are attacked by cheesy-looking bats, who 
   attach themselves to some of the women's faces (and fly directly at 
   the camera), but they all fly away when the Thompson brothers enter 
   the room (Yes, they are so mean, even the bats are scared of them!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A short time later, Polk forcefully enters the home of a baby girl's 
   mother (we know it's a baby girl, because her baby vagina is thrust 
   at the camera!), where he begins to rape the unfortunate woman. Hart 
   then enters the house, killing Polk's henchmen, and begins to beat 
   the crap out of Polk, demanding to know where his wife is. Polk says 
   he doesn't want to know and we see Abilene and several other women 
   walking on a large table, while men (and women) bid on them, buying 
   their bodies for sex. Hart enters the church where the current crop 
   of kidnapped women are being held, telling them that he will lead 
   them to safety, but first he sneaks into the auction house and kills 
   a couple of buyers with his shotgun. He then hold Pike at bay with 
   his shotgun, telling him that if he wants to see Polk alive, he will 
   do what he says. He holds Pike hostage, giving Abilene and the other 
   kidnapped women enough time to escape, but someone with a bullwhip 
   disarms Hart, Pike demanding to know where his brother is. When Hart 
   refuses to tell him, he burns Hart's hand with a red hot poker, Hart 
   spilling the beans (sorry, this is not a 3-D effect!) and Pike riding 
   out to rescue his brother, leaving Hart tied-up in his hideout.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Polk tied to a pipe, while rats feast on his flesh. Pike 
   saves his brother before he becomes a three-course meal for the rats 
   (but they still managed to eat his left eye!). &quot;He kicked 
   me!&quot; says Polk, Pike telling him not to worry, Hart is tied up 
   back at the hideout and he can kill him when they get back.&nbsp; 
   Meanwhile the Preacher and all the escaped women have formed a 
   miniature wagon train, but when a squad of Thompson henchmen&nbsp; 
   show up, the women run for their lives, but they are caught. Abilene, 
   too, as we see her lassoed and dragged through a beach. Polk returns 
   to the hideout and beats the stuffing out of Hart, but Hart manages 
   to turn the tables and kills Polk, escaping while trying to avoid the 
   flying spears and flaming arrows coming his way, being sent by one of 
   Polk's Indian henchmen (This scene must have looked excellent in 
   3-D). Hart manages to kill the Indian with one of his own spears, but 
   Abilene is a prisoner once again. When Pike discovers Polk dead, he 
   begins a long sexual assault on Abilene. Hart discovers Abilene's 
   dress on the beach and knows what he has to do. He also discovers all 
   of the escaped women dead, tied to the ground on spikes, left there 
   to slowly die in the blazing sun.&nbsp; He finds a barely-alive 
   Preacher, who tells Hart that Pike killed all of the women except for 
   his wife, leaving the Preacher alive to tell Hart where to meet Pike 
   if he wants to see his wife alive. Will Hart kill Pike and his

    1985), working with a script written by Gene Quintano, Wolfe 
   Lowenthal and Lloyd Battista (the last two also responsible for the 
   screenplay of <B>MEAN</B>), still manages to milk the many 3-D 
   effects for all they are worth. The opening credits are in 3-D, 
   written in unusual places, such as a snake wrapped around a wine 
   bottle (and the wine bottle's label), the bottom of a horse's hoof, a 
   bag of coffee beans, and a gun barrel, just to name a few. It should 
   also be noted that the opening 15 minutes are dialogue-free, just 
   Carlo Savina's excellent music score and various sound effects, yet 
   it still manages to tell the story about what happened to Hart and 
   his bride. There are also 3-D effects that you will not see in any 
   other film, including the baby girl's nudity, which makes this film 
   stand out from the pack. Even though I watched this film in 2-D, the 
   3-D effects still manage to pack a punch. Sure, there are a lot of 
   gun barrels thrust into the camera and plenty of slow-motion deaths 
   (with bloody bullet sqibs exploding in your face), but it's the 
   little things used for 3-D that makes this film so enjoyable. I 
   should footnote this review by explaining that I never saw a 3-D 
   movie. Hell, I can't even see in 3-D, since I was born with only one 
   working eye (no cyclops jokes, please, I still have two eyes, it's 
   just that one doesn't work). Whenever I wanted to see a 3-D movie, I 
   had to find a theater playing it in 2-D (otherwise it would just be a 
   blur to me), making it tough, especially in the elongated 3-D craze 
   that hit us in the New Millennium (the longest in 3-D history). Since 
   this is an R-Rated 3-D film, even the plentiful female nudity is in 
   your face, as are the bloody deaths. Even Pike's explosive death 
   registers in 2-D, proving to me that you don't need two good eyes to 
   enjoy a 3-D film. Baldi directed a 3-D companion film, the <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS</A></B>

    The film opens with lawman Sgt. Brown (Claudio Undari, as 
   &quot;Robert Undar&quot;; <B><A HREF="#FightingFistJoe1973">THE 
   FIGHTING FIST OF SHANGHAI JOE</A></B> - 1973) escort a wagon 
   containing seven of the worst convicted criminals, all who are 
   serving life terms. Also on this trek are Sgt. Brown's virginal 
   daughter Cathy (Emma Cohen; <B><A HREF="cipolla_colt_1975.htm">CIPOLLA
    COLT</A></B> - 1975) and five Army soldiers, two of them driving the 
   wagon and the other three on horseback, guarding it. We discover that 
   the prisoners, as well as Sgt. Brown, worked in a now played-out gold 
   mine and are being transported to a prison in Fort Green, which is 
   400 miles away. In voiceover narration, Sgt Brown introduces us to 
   the seven prisoners, their crimes and how they are to spend the rest 
   of their lives. There's Dick Patterson (Rafael Hernandez; <B><A HREF="seven_guns_for_the_macgregors_1966.htm">SEVEN
    GUNS FOR THE MACGREGORS</A></B> - 1966), who committed so many

   (Ricardo Diaz; <B><A HREF="eve_1968.htm">EVE</A></B> - 1968), known 
   as &quot;El Comanchero&quot;, he plucked scalps from the Indians and

   NO TIME</A></B> - 1969), no one knows what he is in for (not even 
   Sgt. Brown), but he got life in hard labor. (My biggest problem with 
   this film, and it doesn't interfere with your enjoyment of the film, 
   is why in the hell did Sgt. Brown put his daughter in a wagon 
   containing seven of the of the worst scum of the earth?). All seven 
   men are connected to the same long chain attached to one of their 
   ankles, about three feet of chain separating each prisoner. Sgt. 
   Brown doesn't have the key to unlock the chain (or so he says), it 
   can only be unlocked when they reach the Army prison in Fort Green.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Ray tells one of the soldiers driving the wagon that he has to take 
   a piss and the soldier tells him to do it in his pants, he is not 
   stopping the wagon. Ray does just that (!), saying, &quot;Orders 
   completed soldier!&quot; and everyone has a good laugh. It will be 
   the last laugh any of them will have, as they are about to experience 
   brutality on an epic level. About halfway to Fort Green, the wagon is 
   held up by a family of bandits, the father (Francisco Nieto; <B><A HREF="if_you_shoot_you_live_1975.htm">IF
    YOU SHOOT...YOU LIVE!</A></B> - 1975) demanding to know where the 
   shipment of gold is hidden. Both soldiers driving the wagon tell him 
   there is no gold on the wagon, they are transporting prisoners, so 
   the son kills one of them with his rifle (When the grandfather [Juan 
   Antonio Elices; <B><A HREF="death_on_high_mountain_1969.htm">DEATH ON 
   HIGH MOUNTAIN</A></B> - 1969] takes off the dead soldier's boots to 
   claim them as his, the father yells at him and says not to embarrass 
   him, check his teeth for gold first!). The father then checks the 
   inside of the wagon and sees the prisoners (Sgt. Brown pretends to be 
   one of them, hiding his daughter behind his back) and tells his son 
   to search the wagon carefully for the hidden gold. When the son finds 
   nothing, he pulls the other driver off the wagon and crushes his 
   skull in with the butt of his rifle (The first gore scene, very 
   bloody). The father then orders the remaining three soldiers to 
   dismount their horses and kills them (including a nasty throat 
   slicing), slaps the horses attached to the wagon, sending it on its 
   way down a twisty icy mountain road without a driver. Sgt. Brown 
   tries to stop the wagon, but when he can't, he and Cathy jump off the 
   wagon just before it tumbles down an incline off the road (I felt 
   really bad for the horses, as we see them fall with the wagon down a 
   snowy hill into some trees. It's obvious the ASPCA was not involved 
   with the making of this film!). After checking on Cathy to see if 
   she's OK, Sgt. Brown then checks on the prisoners and finds them all 
   bloody and bruised, but OK, only Slim has a badly broken leg and 
   can't walk. Sgt. Brown makes the prisoners carry Slim in turns as 
   they head off on foot to Fort Green, ignoring Thomas' pleas to cut 
   off Slim's ankle with his machete because he's about to die 
   (Remember, Sgt. Brown says he doesn't have the keys to the chain).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sgt. Brown estimates that it will take six days or more to travel to 
   Fort Green on foot, so he makes the prisoners ration the food and 
   provisions that they have (We then hear the prisoners sing a song 
   about how they are going to kill Sgt, Brown if he turns his back on 
   them!). That night, we see the prisoners picking straws, the shortest 
   one is to kill Slim in his sleep. We then see someone killing Slim 
   (we don't see who is doing it...yet). The next morning, when Sgt. 
   Brown discovers Slim dead, he orders the prisoners to tell him which 
   one of them killed Slim. When they won't tell him, Sgt. Brown 
   punishes them by making them carry Slim's corpse instead of cutting 
   off his ankle and removing the chain from his body. One of the two 
   horses Sgt. Brown saved breaks its leg in some deep snow, forcing him 
   to shoot it in the head with his pistol (It doesn't go unnoticed by 
   the prisoners that Sgt. Brown treats the horses better than he does 
   them). When Sgt. Brown wakes up the following morning, he discovers 
   Slim's corpse roasting in the campfire while the prisoners laugh. He 
   hands his machete to Dean, who cuts off Slim's leg off at the<A HREF="cut-throats_nine_1971.htm#Ad Mat"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/duel of the iron fist-cut-throats nine ad mat116 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="370" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   revealed that I didn't see coming.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When John is bashing the chain with a rock (to annoy Sgt. Brown), he 
   discovers that the chain is made of gold! That's right, the chain 
   that binds these six prisoners together is made from gold taken from 
   the played-out mine and Sgt. Brown knew all about it. He tells Thomas 
   what's a better way to hide gold than to use it as restraints on 
   prisoners who would kill to get their hands on it. The irony is not 
   lost on Thomas, who then throws another revelation our way, asking 
   Sgt. Brown if he still believes that one of them killed his wife (and 
   Cathy's mother)! That's right, one of these prisoners viciously 
   murdered Sgt. Brown's wife, Ely (Mabel Karr; <B><A HREF="killer_tongue_1996.htm">KILLER
    TONGUE</A></B> - 1996). Flashbacks show up throughout the remainder 
   of the film showing us that any one of the prisoners could have done 
   it (She is stabbed in her stomach until her intestines fall to the 
   floor!). Now things get very interesting, as we try to discover who 
   did it, but there is more than one surprise in store for the viewer.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After discovering that their chain is made of gold, the prisoners 
   refuse to move, so Sgt. Brown shoots Joe in the face, killing him 
   (very graphic) and then cuts his foot off with his machete. Cathy 
   begins to realize that her father is no better than the prisoners, 
   asking him if he is willing to kill four innocent men to get to her 
   mother's killer. He says yes, all these men are killers and they are 
   guilty of something far worse than murder, they just were caught for 
   another crime. They are a waste of human skin according to him. As 
   they make the long walk though deep snow and freezing temperatures, 
   Cathy passes out from exhaustion and Sgt. Brown is forced to carry 
   her (he won't allow her to get close to the prisoners).&nbsp; The 
   prisoners then find an abandoned house and run to it, leaving an 
   exhausted Sgt. Brown behind them, still carrying Cathy's body. The 
   prisoners look out a window and see Sgt. Brown pass out from 
   exhaustion and when he wakes up, he finds himself tied-up inside the 
   house, as the prisoners take turns beating him. He is then forced to 
   watch as Ray, Dick and John take turns raping Cathy (very hard to 
   watch) over Dean and a reluctant Thomas' objections (Thomas watches 
   them rape Cathy, but the look on his face tells us he doesn't 
   approve). In another plot twist I didn't see coming, the prisoners 
   burn down the abandoned house with a tied-up Sgt. Brown still inside, 
   as we watch him burn to death (another scene very hard to watch).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The prisoners continue their trek through the snowy mountains with 
   Cathy as their hostage, only Dean protects her so she doesn't get 
   raped again (Dean kills John for raping Cathy as they are walking in 
   the snow and then uses the machete to cut off his leg). The prisoner 
   are starving, as they haven't eaten for days, yet Thomas refuse to 
   relinquish Sgt. Brown's pistol to Dean, who is a crack shot, wasting 
   a bullet trying to kill a deer for dinner. Thomas finally relents due 
   to severe hunger and Dean shoots and kills a deer. Everyone then has 
   a nice meal, but Dean refuses to give the pistol back to Thomas, 
   figuring he and Cathy would be safer if he kept it. Gold fever then 
   hits the prisoners and they begin to turn on each other, but Dick 
   intervenes, saying he has a plan and if they all stick to it, they 
   all will be rich. The plan involves a trading post a few miles ahead 
   that Dick visited years before where they can all have a drink and a 
   good meal, because he knows the proprietor, Caldwell (Emilio 
   Rodriguez; <B><A HREF="tough_one_1966.htm">THE TOUGH ONE</A></B> - 
   1966), but first they have to find a way to remove the chain from 
   their bodies. They come upon some railroad tracks and follow them 
   until they get to the tunnel. Thomas comes up with the idea to lay 
   the chain across the railroad tracks so a passing train will cut them 
   off. It works like a charm and the prisoners are no longer chained 
   together, each of them having the same length of gold chain on their 
   possession. Ray begins going crazy, partly due to hunger, partly due 
   to alcohol (which he found at the abandoned house) and partly 
   because, well, he is crazy. He breaks off from the group by himself, 
   where he hallucinates that Sgt. Brown has returned from the dead to 
   kill him (this sequence is haunting and very well done, as Ray 
   imagines the burned abandoned house becoming whole again [thanks to 
   running the film backwards, but it is still effective] and a 
   hideously burned Sgt. Brown walking out of it). The bandit father 
   discovers a delirious Ray babbling in the snow and when he discovers 
   his chain is made of gold, he demands that Ray tell him where the 
   rest of the prisoners are headed. They all head to the trading post, 
   where the film concludes, but not before both Ray and Dean are killed 
   and we find out, from flashbacks, who actually killed Slim and Sgt. 
   Brown's wife. <B>Warning SPOILERS!!!</B> It was Dean and when Cathy 
   realizes that life's not worth living anymore, she decides to kill 
   Dick and Thomas, as well as herself, by lighting a stick of dynamite 
   and putting it on top of a crate of explosives while Thomas and Dick 
   are about to slaughter a regiment of Army soldiers riding towards the 
   trading post. The film ends with the trading post exploding and there 
   are no survivors. I told you it was nihilistic, didn't I? <B>END OF SPOILLERS!!!</B></FONT></FONT><BR>

    This downbeat Spaghetti Western, directed by Joaquin Romero Merchant (<B><A HREF="implacable_three_1963.htm">IMPLACABLE

   by going left when you are expecting a right, keeping the viewer off 
   guard, such as Sgt. Brown's unexpected death. The film is also full 
   of gory deaths, still considered shocking today, due to the realistic 
   manner they are displayed (and it doesn't hurt that they are very 
   well done). When Dick savagely kills Caldwell by stabbing him in the 
   stomach with a large knife and the impales his back with a baling 
   hook while hoisting him up in the air with a pulley, all because he 
   owed him five dollars from years ago (!), you know this film isn't 
   going to play fair. Believe me, this is not your standard Spaghetti 
   Western, as no one here has anything representing a moral center, not 
   even Sgt. Brown. The screenplay, by Joaquin Romero Hernandez (<B><A HREF="kill_them_all_and_come_back_alone_1968.htm">KILL

    letting up. Now, the next bit of information may not be true (I have 
   my doubts about its validity given its source), but I'm going to tell 
   you anyway. This is verbatim from the back of the double feature DVD 
   sleeve released by Code Red: <B>&quot;Distributor Seafirm Kalalexis 
   picked up this film several years later, re-shot gory violence as a 
   gimmick to bring in the audience at 42nd Street with a cardboard mask 
   given to paying attendence (sp) to wear to avoid watching the violent 
   scene when it happens. The gimmick was a failure, but thanks to 
   today's youth audience the film now gain a cult following thanks to 
   Kalalexis added scene. Code Red and Seafirm Kalalexis is proud to 
   bring you for the first time the gory classic out authorized in USA!&quot;</B> 
   Not only does that quotation contain Code Red's founder William 
   Olsen's usual fractured sentence structure, as he butchers the 
   English language, I also doubt that much of it is true at all. Sure, 
   a cardboard mask was offered to audiences (the <A HREF="cut-throats_nine_1971.htm#Theatrical">posters</A> 
   prove that), but I doubt there are any extra &quot;scene&quot; that 
   were filmed &quot;years later&quot;, as all the gore scenes show the 
   same actors clearly being killed. It seems quite hard for me to 
   believe, if not impossible, that Kalalexis would find the same actors 
   years later and then getting them to appear in re-shoots. It just 
   doesn't wash.&nbsp; Still, this movie should be on your 
   &quot;must-see&quot; list if you are a fan of Spaghetti Westerns. It 
   contains everything we expect from a film in this genre, only this 
   one is taken several degrees higher than we expected.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with Cash following land baron Diaz (Richard Conte; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973) as they trek through a desert, 
   Diaz carrying the guns and Cash behind him with the only canteen of 
   water. Flashbacks then show us how they ended up in this situation. 
   Cash entered Diaz's town (which he created for his sole pleasure, 
   telling Cash that he will never know how it feels to own and control 
   land, or even experience owning grain!) and killed all of his men, 
   taking Diaz's wife hostage. Diaz begs for his wife's life and then 
   betrays her, jumping out a window with a bagful of money and running 
   into the desert, Cash grabbing a canteen of water and not realizing 
   he has bullets, but no gun. Back in the present, a few days later, 
   Diaz is dying of thirst while Cash splashes his face with water, 
   telling Diaz that there is a well he missed just behind him that has 
   plenty of water. Diaz walks to a homemade graveyard cross in the 
   middle of the desert and keeps Cash at bay by firing his pistol at 
   him, running out of bullets. When night comes, a delirious Diaz (who 
   drops his gun at the cross) crawls to the well behind Cash and 
   discovers it is a fake, Cash creating it out of racks. Cash grabs the 
   pistol at the cross and guns down Diaz, sand slipping through his 
   dead fingers like freshly harvested grain. One down, three to go.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Cash then enters the town of high-stakes gambler Montero (Enrico 
   Maria Salerno; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Night Train Murders">NIGHT 
   TRAIN MURDERS</A></B> - 1974), a man who enjoys winning other 
   people's money and leaving them penniless, killing those who can't 
   pay up. Cash gets into a high stakes game of poker with him and wins 
   all of Montero's money, telling him to come back when he has more 
   money. Montero does just that, so the next day, Cash and Montero have 
   another game of poker and Cash wins all of Montero's money on the 
   first hand, telling Montero that if he wants to play another hand, 
   the stakes will be much higher. Being a gambler, Montero agrees. The 
   next game will be for their lives, whomever wins this hand gets to 
   kill the other one. They both put their pistols on the table and Cash 
   deals the cards. Montero has four Kings and grabs his pistol to shoot 
   Cash, thinking he has the winning hand. A shot rings out and we see 
   Montero falling to the floor, dead, Cash walking away. When someone 
   looks at Cash's hand of cards, they discover he had four Aces. Two 
   down, two to go.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next time we see Cash, he is in a Mexican town run by Friar 
   Baldwin (Adolfo Celi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhoSawHerDie">WHO SAW 
   HER DIE?</A></B> - 1972), who forces his brand of deadly vigilante 
   religion on the Mexican people, thanks to his flock of black-wearing 
   followers. Friar Baldwin knows who Cash is and why he is here, taking 
   him prisoner and then dragging him through the desert on the back of 
   a horse, leaving him there when he refuse to tell him where the money 
   is hidden (Money is more important to Baldwin than religion). Baldwin 
   shows Cash how powerful he is by taking one of Cash's bullets and 
   pulling the projectile off the cartridge, dropping the shell at his 
   feet. He then shoots Cash in the leg with his own pistol and hands it 
   to him, no bullets in it and no bullets on his person. The Friar and 
   his flock then leave Cash out in the desert, telling him they will 
   return the next night and he better tell them where the money is or 
   he will be dead. The next night, The Friar and his black-clad flock 
   return to the desert and confront Cash. He still refuses to tell 
   Baldwin where the money is hidden, so the Friar tells his flock to 
   ride away, he will kill Cash himself. Cash pulls out his pistol and 
   pulls the trigger, but all there is is the sound of a click. Just 
   when it looks like curtains for Cash, he pulls the trigger a second 
   time and shoots Baldwin in the face, killing him. How can this be, 
   when Cash had no bullets?&nbsp; Remember that cartridge that the 
   Friar dropped at Cash's feet? Well, he picked it up, dug out the 
   projectile from his leg with a sharp rock and made a complete bullet! 
   Three down, one to go.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is the most enjoyably weird episode in the film. Cash rides 
   into a run-down town without a bank. It seems that there is an albino 
   named O'Hara (Tomas Milian; <B><A HREF="#DjangoKill1967">DJANGO KILL</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="#DjangoKill1967">!

    YOU LIVE SHOOT!</A></B><A HREF="#DjangoKill1967">)</A> - 1967), who 
   is so obsessed with gold, he reaches orgasm when he touches it. He 
   loves gold so much, he would steal it out of your teeth, just so he 
   could rub it between his fingers. O'Hara is also obsessed with women 
   with blonde hair, treating them the same way he does gold. Cash 
   arrives in a wagon with three heavy crates, telling the people in 
   town that he intends to open a bank and the crates contain gold. Cash 
   re-opens the old, deserted bank and it is not long before O'Hara and 
   his gang break into it, O&quot;Hara finding a gold coin on the 
   counter and fondling it like it was a sexy woman (it's quite the 
   sight, as the white wig-wearing Milian, who is also dressed in all 
   white, caresses the coin with a look as if he is about to ejaculate, 
   saying, &quot;How warm it is...just like a woman's skin&quot;!). When 
   O'Hara tells his men to open the crates (He tells them to open the 
   crates slowly, because he wants &quot;savor this pleasure to the 
   limit&quot;!), all they find are rocks inside it (When Milian see the 
   rocks in the crate, he gives a look that can best be described as a 
   man suddenly losing an erection!). Cash then kills a few of O'Hara's 
   men and rides away, but O'Hara knows that Cash has gold, because he 
   can smell it (Cash has some people in town take the crates to an old 
   cemetery on the outskirts of town, where an old church stands). The 
   next time we see Cash, he is on horseback with Sally (Eleonor Brown; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NakedYouDie">NAKED
    YOU DIE</A></B> - 1968). They are riding through a valley that leads 
   to the old cemetery, when Sally sees some men with guns watching them 
   overhead. Cash tells her not to worry and to take off her scarf. When 
   she removes the scarf from her head, revealing blonde hair, O'Hara 
   tells his men not to shoot Cash because he must touch that woman's 
   beautiful blonde hair! That night, after Cash kills all of O'Hara's 
   men (and we then discover that this is the cemetery Cash's brother 
   was buried in), OHara gets the drop on Cash (by pretending to be 
   dead) and makes him dig his own grave in the cemetery, digging up his 
   brother's grave. Cash then throws some dirt into O'Hara's eyes and 
   disappears. O'Hara goes looking for him and finds Sally instead and 
   he is instantly smitten, telling Sally he is not going to hurt her, 
   he just wants to run her hair through his fingers (&quot;Never in my 
   life have I seen hair so beautiful!&quot;). O'Hara then goes 
   full-tilt loony on Sally, grabbing her, kissing her and saying, 
   &quot;Your golden hair makes me crazy!&quot; and acting like a dog in 
   heat. Sally pushes him away and he apologizes, telling Sally he is 
   going to fetch a couple of horses so they can ride away together, 
   completely forgetting about Cash (which was Cash's plan from the 
   beginning). As O'Hara goes to fetch the horses, he passes by the 
   freshly dug grave and looks inside. He is surprised to see Cash 
   rising from the darkness out of his brother's grave, where he shoots 
   and kills O'Hara and he falls into his brother's grave. A fitting end 
   to to a clever plan. Four down, vengeance over.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Not only is this film a pleasure to watch, it is also a very strange 
   Spaghetti Western, full of great performances and set pieces. Director/screen
    writer Mario Lanfranchi (<B><A HREF="merciless_man_1976.htm">MERCILESS
    MAN</A></B> - 1976) has <A HREF="death_sentence_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death sentence 1968 italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>delivered
    a film that may seem fractured when initially watched, but makes 
   perfect sense when viewed all the way through. It doesn't concern 
   itself with secondary characters, as any of them are disposable, such 
   as a woman Cash meets in Montero's town.&nbsp; Cash kisses her and 
   the next time we see her, she is lying dead in the street, no 
   explanation how she got there. There really is no explanation needed, 
   because we already know that Cash is dealing with scum of the highest 
   order, where a person's life means nothing. The only two secondary 
   characters to register are Sally and Paco, played by hunchback actor <A HREF="luciano_rossi_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Luciano
    Rossi</A> (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH 
   SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973), a peasant in O'Hara's town that 
   Cash pays with a gold coin to drag the crates into the bank. Rossi 
   cleverly hides his hump behind a sombrero he wears across his back, 
   hanging from his neck, and the look on his face when Cash hands him a 
   gold coin is priceless. But this film registers thanks to the cast of 
   villains, all of them given different personalities and their deaths 
   fitting of those personalities. It should also be noted that Cash 
   himself also has some peculiar quirks, the biggest one being that he 
   only drinks milk (!), even in bars, which opens him up to many jokes 
   at his expense. He also doesn't like to waste bullets, as every pull 
   of the trigger he makes is a death shot. He does not shoot to injure. 
   But this film clearly belongs to Tomas Milian. His portrayal of an 
   albino is so unexpected and unusual, you can't help but love him, 
   even though he is a bad guy. When you see how he reacts to a single 
   gold coin, you can only imagine how he will react to a pile of gold. 
   His performance is what makes this film so special and his episode in 
   this film is rightly the longest. Milian was an actor (he passed away 
   in 2017) who always delivered and was like a chameleon, looking 
   different in every film he appeared in. Equally talented to play both 
   good and bad guys, Milian was the man you wanted if a role called for 
   something unusual, because he could make it memorable. I liked this 
   film a lot and admire its strange structure, which was off-putting at 
   first, but is satifying when seen as a whole. Reccomended to both 
   Spaghetti Western addicts and fans of the unusual.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   You know a film is going to be quite unusual when gambler Whittaker 
   Selby (Thomas Hunter; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HumanFactor1975">THE
    'HUMAN' FACTOR</A></B> - 1974) wins a big hand at poker, puts his 
   money in his hat and begins walking away, only the four other players 
   pull out their guns and tell him the game's not over and he's not 
   going anywhere. What they don't expect is &quot;Whitty&quot; pulling 
   out a four-barrel pistol and shooting all of them dead, with one pull 
   of the trigger! Whitty is then approached by a lawyer, who tells him 
   that his dead father left him a valuable gold mine in Laredo, Texas. 
   Whitty tells the lawyer<A HREF="death_walks_in_laredo_1967.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death walks in laredo poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   his father has been dead for ten years and he replies that he just 
   got the will, the mail came ten years late! What the lawyer fails to 
   tell him is that he has two brothers he never knew about and they, 
   too, get equal shares in the mine. We then meet the two brothers, 
   Frenchman Etienne Devereau (Nadir Moretti; <B><A HREF="hercules_against_the_mongols_1963.htm">HERCULES
    AGAINST THE MONGOLS</A></B> - 1963), who is irresistible to women 
   and has a strange power that freezes men's hands from throwing knives 
   or pulling triggers, telling a pretty young woman &quot;It's 
   magnetism. Simple magnetism&quot;; and Lester Koto (James Shigeta; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Cage1989">CAGE</A></B>

   man who is an expert at jiu jitsu, using it on a man who calls him

    When Whitty arrives in Laredo, he watches chorus girl Mady (Delia 
   Boccardo; <B><A HREF="ring_of_death_1969.htm">RING OF DEATH</A></B> - 
   1969) sing a song (very catchy) in the saloon and then asks the 
   bartender where his father's ranch is located. A man dressed in black 
   then clears the saloon, telling everyone to get out, saying to Whitty 
   he is the third stranger to ask the location of that ranch 
   (&quot;Repetition's annoyin'&quot;, says the man in black). Suddenly 
   a bunch of men in black surround Whitty and the man tells him to hand 
   over his pistols &quot;by the barrel, polecat&quot; (uh, oh!). Whitty 
   removes his pistols by their barrels, only for all the men in black 
   to discover that Whitty's pistols have barrels in their grips (!), as 
   he shoots all of them dead (Where does he get such strange 
   weapons?!?). Mady then tells Whitty where the ranch is and he walks 
   out of the saloon.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then meet the &quot;big baddie&quot;, Julius Caesar Fuller 
   (Enrico Maria Salerno; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Night Train Murders">NIGHT
    TRAIN MURDERS</A></B> - 1974), who is obsessed with (who else?) 
   Julius Caesar, copying his lifestyle down to the smallest detail. He 
   has a nameless history professor (Feruccio De Ceresa; <B><A HREF="wild_wild_planet_1965.htm">THE
    WILD, WILD PLANET</A></B> - 1965) read him a book on Caesar while he 
   frolics with a group of barely-dressed harem girls in his own private 
   bathhouse. Fuller's right-hand man, Bronson (Umberto D'Orsi; <B><A HREF="#FightingFistJoe1973">THE
    FIGHTING FIST OF SHANGHAI JOE</A></B> - 1973) informs him that three 
   strangers have rode into town, all of them asking about the ranch and 
   the mine, so Fuller has the professor give Bronson a lesson on making 
   history (It's quite clear that Fuller is not the brightest bulb in 
   the room).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The three brothers meet for the first time in the mine and rather 
   than fighting, they get along rather well. An old man named Stanford 
   (Vittorio Bonos; <B><A HREF="ringo_and_his_golden_pistol_1966.htm">RINGO
    AND HIS GOLDEN PISTOL</A></B> - 1966) informs the trio that the mine 
   is played out, all of the gold was mined a long time ago and there is 
   nothing left. The sheriff of Laredo (who is on Fuller's payroll) then 
   arrives and arrests the three brothers for trespassing because the 
   mine now belongs to Fuller. We then see Fuller (dressed in a toga!) 
   telling Bronson and the sheriff that he believes there is a fortune 
   in gold hidden somewhere on the dead father's property and he 
   believes the three brothers will lead him to it. Whitty believes that 
   if they want to find why their father gave them a worthless mine, 
   they should start from the beginning, trying to discover how their 
   father died. A resident gives the trio a tip and they ride to a house 
   inhabited by Olaf Simpson (actor unknown) and&nbsp; his four sons 
   (actors unknown), but the four brothers stop the trio from seeing 
   their father by proving themselves to be sharpshooters (by shooting 
   the hats off the trio's heads). When they discover who the trio are, 
   they bring them to their father, who tells them Fuller killed their 
   father. Olaf also tells them that they should talk to the young girl 
   who was always by their father's side ten years ago. Olaf doesn't 
   know her name, but he is sure she wasn't their father's daughter. 
   When the trio leave Olaf's house, the men in black show up and kill 
   the four sons and kidnap Olaf, but the trio hear the gunfire and 
   rescue Olaf, killing thirty of Fuller's men. When Fuller hears the 
   news, he is very pissed at Bronson, telling him if the three brothers 
   are not dead within 24 hours, he will be instead.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Etienne using his special powers on the roulette wheel 
   in the saloon, making the ball fall on the number and color he and 
   Lester are betting on, while Whitty questions Mady about where Fuller 
   lives (Etienne's powers lead to a barroom brawl, the saloon owners 
   accusing him of cheating). We then see that Fuller lives in a mansion 
   that looks like an ancient Roman building, complete with a wooden 
   elevator that lowers him from a cliff the house is built on. He 
   entertains the prominent residents of Laredo with a woman named Tula 
   (the beautiful Femi Benussi; <B><A HREF="#StrangerGunfight74">THE 
   STRANGER AND THE GUNFIGHTER</A></B> - 1974), who belly dances for the 
   appreciative audience.&nbsp; While waiting in a cave for Mady to 
   bring them provisions, the trio saves a woman named Deborah Smith 
   (Gianna Serra; <B><A HREF="hills_run_red_1966.htm">THE HILLS RUN RED</A></B> 
   - 1966; a film that shares many of the same people, both in front and 
   behind the camera, as this film), who is being chased by Fuller's 
   gang. Debbie offers to make them dinner and they happily accept, but 
   I know what you are thinking: Is this the young girl that was always 
   by their father's side? Debbie tells them that she never knew her 
   father and she was adopted at a young age. The trio then believes 
   that she is their adopted sister, but it is obvious Debbie knows 
   something, but she's not saying what it is. Whitty then believes that 
   Mady is a traitor, but Stanford informs him that Mady is actually 
   their father's adopted daughter, not Debbie. She works for Fuller. 
   Whitty tells Mady to race to his two brothers before they fall to 
   Debbie's treachery and when she gets there, Mady gets into a catfight 
   with Debbie and tells Lester and Etienne that Whitty is heading to 
   Fuller's place and they should go and help him, so they ride off to 
   help their brother while Mady deals with Debbie. Whitty, along with 
   Stanford, falls for a trap set up by Fuller and Bronson, and Fuller 
   lets Stanford go (&quot;He is worthless to me!&quot;, says Fuller and 
   Bronson slaps Stanford across the face, Stanford telling him that one 
   day he will kill him). Whitty is hung upside down, his feet tied to a 
   tree branch while his body swings over a fire, while the men in black 
   slap him around and laugh. Will Etienne and Lester save their brother 
   from being roasted like a pig? Will Stanford kill Bronson? Will 
   Fuller die like the real Julius Caesar? Will the trio and adopted 
   sister Mady find the hidden treasure of gold? Just when it looks <A HREF="death_walks_in_laredo_1967.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death walks in laredo italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>like
    one of these questions is never going to be answered, Whitty ties 
   himself to his father's bed, ignoring the sheriff, who wants him and 
   his brothers to leave town permanently. The sheriff and his men have 
   to carry the whole bed, containing Whitty, and put it on a cart, 
   while Mady, Lester and Etienne leave town with Whitty and the bed. 
   The entire film hinges on that one unanswered question and then 
   Whitty reveals that the bed is made entirely of gold in the surprise 
   finale. All four of them celebrate as they ride out of Laredo, richer 
   for their experience, not only in money, but also in discovering a 
   new family that they didn't know they had.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While there is very little meat to the plot of this early Dino De 
   Laurentiis production, it is still an enjoyable trifle nonetheless. 
   It doesn't try to explain why Whitty has such unusual weapons or how 
   Etienne came to have his unusual powers, they are what they are.

   Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to a film that nearly defies 
   description; a tale so strange that, after viewing it, you will feel 
   that someone slipped you a mickey in your drink. Your eyes and ears 
   will be amazed by what you see and hear; your brain may feel fried, 
   but relaxed, and your skin may be filled with goosebumps, yet you are 
   not scared at all. Let's take a trip to a little town called &quot;The
    Unhappy Place&quot;, a small Western city that would give <B><A HREF="twin_peaks_tv_series.htm">TWIN
    PEAKS</A></B> the shivers; a place where no one can be trusted and 
   alliances can turn on a dime. This is a Spaghetti Western like no 
   other, but before we get to<A HREF="django_kill_if_you_live_shoot_1967.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/django kill blu-ray front small2a.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="237" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   this town, we must explain why we go to it in the first place.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We see a Mexican man known simply as &quot;The Stranger&quot; (Tomas 
   Milian; <B><A HREF="#Four Apocalypse1975">FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE</A></B> 
   - 1975) digging himself out of a mass grave with his bare hands. Two 
   unnamed Indians (yet they are important to the film) tend to the 
   Stranger's bullet wounds and tell him they are going to help him if 
   he tells them what it is like on &quot;the other side&quot;, or in 
   better terms, what it's like being dead. The Stranger (the name 
   &quot;Django&quot; is not uttered once in this film) first tells them 
   how he ended up in a mass grave. (Flashback): The Stranger and his 
   Mexican gang, along with Oaks (Piero Lulli; <B><A HREF="god_made_them_i_kill_them_1968.htm">GOD
    MADE THEM...I KILL THEM</A></B> - 1968) and his gang of American 
   outlaws, rob a U.S. Army transport full of gold dust, killing all the 
   soldiers in the process. Oak and his outlaws turn on the Stranger and 
   his Mexican gang, making them dig a mass grave that they will 
   eventually be buried in. One Mexican manages to cut the tendons on 
   the horses belonging to the Oaks Gang and manages to chase the other 
   horses away before he is gunned down. Oaks and his gang then line up 
   the Stranger and the other Mexicans, gunning them down as they fall 
   in the mass grave. Oaks and his gang then hoof it by foot through the 
   desert, the only two horses they have left carrying the heavy gold 
   dust. After walking through the desert for a long time, Oaks and his 
   gang come upon a strange town the Indians call &quot;The Unhappy 
   Place&quot;. Oaks walks into the saloon/hotel and everyone inside 
   stops what they are doing and stare at Oaks, who says he wants to buy 
   some horses and has plenty of gold to pay for them. Saloon/hotel 
   owner Bill Templar (Milo Quesada; <B><A HREF="professionals_for_a_massacre_1967.htm">PROFESSIONALS
    FOR A MASSACRE</A></B> - 1967) offers to get the horses for him, 
   walking out of the saloon, but not before secretly looking at a 
   wanted poster for Oaks (End of Flashback).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The two Indians makes bullets out of the gold dust they find on the 
   Stranger, telling him he will need them to get his revenge. They then 
   take their mule-driven carriage to The Unhappy Place (the Indians 
   tell the Stranger that they do not know what the white man calls this 
   town and we never find out), where the Stranger watches the 
   townspeople hanging all the members of the Oaks gang. They even hang 
   the members of the gang that they shot and killed (by their legs)! 
   Oaks is pinned down in the haberdasher's shop, so the Stranger puts 
   gold bullets in his pistol and goes gunning for Oaks, who can't 
   believe what he sees, thinking the Stranger is dead and couldn't 
   possibly be alive, he covered his dead body in dirt. The Stranger 
   enters the store and a gunfight ensues (pay close attention to the 
   photographic tricks in this sequence, proving the Stranger is a 
   &quot;man of many hats&quot;!), where Oaks can't seem to hit his 
   target (Is the Stranger untouchable?). The Stranger empties his 
   pistol into Oaks, who stumbles outside and falls to the ground. The 
   townspeople surround Oaks and just as they are about to end his life 
   with a bullet in his brainpan, town criminal patriarch Sorrow 
   (Roberto Camardiel; <B><A HREF="relentless_four_1965.htm">THE 
   RELENTLESS FOUR</A></B> - 1965) stops them, saying he wants him 
   alive&nbsp; and ordering the town doctor to remove the bullets from 
   Oaks' body and makes sure he stays alive, because he has some 
   questions that need to be answered. We then watch the doctor removing 
   a bullet from Oaks' chest (Surprisingly very gory and cut from all 
   English-dubbed prints, as this scene, and one other, are in Italian 
   with English subtitles). When the doctor looks at the bullet, he 
   says, &quot;It's made out of solid gold!&quot;, which results in the 
   townspeople watching the surgery to try to dig out the other bullets 
   in Oaks' body with their bare hands, killing Oaks! Sorrow is pissed 
   that Oaks is dead and asks Bill Templar&nbsp; and Alderman Hagerman 
   (Francisco 'Paco' Sanz; <B><A HREF="fasthand_1973.htm">FASTHAND</A></B> 
   - 1973) where the gold is, but they tell him they have no idea what 
   he is talking about. Sorrow knows they are lying and tells them he 
   will return to town shortly and they better have the gold waiting for him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Of course, Bill and Hagerman are hiding the gold from everyone and 
   plan on splitting it fifty-fifty. Bill tells town floozie Flory 
   (Maril&ugrave; Tolo; <B><A HREF="roy_colt_and_winchester_jack_1970.htm">ROY
    COLT &amp; WINCHESTER JACK</A></B> - 1970) that he plans on marrying 
   her and both of them moving out of this flea-bitten town as soon as 
   he saves up enough money (not bothering to tell her about the gold). 
   Is Bill telling Flory the truth? Is he even serious about splitting 
   the gold with Hagerman? The Stranger, meanwhile, tells his two Indian 
   friends that he is staying in this town, so he takes a room in Bill's 
   boardinghouse. Flory tells her betrothed that the Stranger must be 
   nervous because she hears him pacing back and forth in his room (In 
   reality, the Stranger just saw the townspeople hanging Oaks' dead 
   body by his feet when he looked out the window!). Later that night, 
   Flory peeks through a keyhole and sees Bill and Hagerman with the 
   gold, not knowing that Bill's son, Evan (an impossibly young Ray 
   [&quot;Raymond&quot;] Lovelock; <B><A HREF="action.htm#MeetHim&amp;Die1976">MEET
    HIM AND DIE</A></B> - 1976), is watching her. Evan walks away, not 
   saying anything to Flory; instead he goes to her room, pulls out his 
   knife and begins slashing all of Flory's clothes, as well as her bed 
   and pillows. Evan then walks into the Stranger's room and asks him to 
   take him wherever he is going. He tells Evan that he is not going 
   anywhere, he is staying in town for the foreseeable future. The 
   Stranger then goes outside, where he and his two Indian friends cut 
   down all the hanging members of the Oaks Gang, which pisses off Bill 
   and the townspeople, who tell him to leave town immediately. The 
   Stranger says he can't, he doesn't have a horse. We then see the 
   Stranger roping a wild mustang, making it his own. He then watches as 
   members of Sorrow's gang kidnap Evan. He tries to stop them, but is 
   unsuccessful. Sorrow then appears and tells the Stranger he needs a 
   man like him, inviting him to a party he is throwing at his ranch. 
   Sorrow actually had Evan kidnapped knowing Bill and Hagerman have the 
   gold and he threatens to kill Bill's son if he doesn't pay a hefty 
   gold ransom, but what he doesn't count on is Hagerman refusing to 
   give Bill any of his gold share, telling Bill that Evan is his son 
   and therefore his responsibility. When Bill refuses to leave until he 
   gets the gold, Hagerman pulls out a pistol and threatens to shoot him 
   if he doesn't leave. Bill has no other choice but to leave without 
   the gold (Telling Hagerman, &quot;I'll make you pay!&quot;), which 
   makes Flory believe her future husband is a coward. There's just no 
   pleasing a loose woman. Flory tells Bill to say to Pedro (Sisto 
   Brunetti; <B><A HREF="churchills_leopards_1970.htm">CHURCHILL'S LEOPARDS</A></B> 
   - 1970), Sorrow's man who came to collect the ransom, that he has no 
   gold, so Pedro rides back to Sorrow's ranch and tells him Bill 
   doesn't have any gold. Sorrow tells the Stranger that he can carry 
   Evan's corpse back to Bill, ordering one of his men to kill Evan. The 
   Stranger tells Sorrow not to kill Evan, he has an idea on how to make 
   the boy useful to them. He tells Sorrow he will get him the gold if 
   he agrees not to kill Evan and Sorrow agrees, but only if the 
   Stranger will drink an entire bottle of whiskey and then successfully 
   shoot the rope that binds Evan to the <A HREF="django_kill_if_you_live_shoot_1967.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/django kill germany poster small2a.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>wall!
    The Stranger drinks the bottle and then shoots Sorrow's best gunman, 
   Willie (F&eacute;lix Sancho Gracia; <B><A HREF="taste_for_killing_1966.htm">TASTE
    FOR KILLING</A></B> - 1966), in his shooting hand. For some 
   unexplained reason, Sorrow is impressed with the Stranger's actions 
   and frees Evan. The Stranger then watches in silence as Sorrow's 
   black-clad gunslingers make homosexual advances to Evan!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Early the next morning we see Evan taking a gun from one of the 
   passed-out drunk gunmen, walk into another room and blow his brains 
   out. I can only guess why he did it was because this was not the way 
   Evan expected to lose his virginity! The Stranger brings Evan's 
   corpse back to town, delivering it to Bill, where a barfight begins 
   after the Stranger slugs Bill in the face. After it is over, the 
   Stranger tells Bill to give Sorrow the gold, otherwise Sorrow and his 
   men will come to town, destroy it and kill everyone while they look 
   for the gold. The stranger then walks out of the saloon and notices 
   the same woman he saw when he first arrived in town looking at him 
   through the same barred window on the second floor of a building. 
   Hagerman then taps him on the shoulder and says they have the same 
   enemy in common, Bill. He tells the Stranger that Bill is dangerous; 
   he tried to kill him yesterday. He then invites the Stranger into his 
   house, the same building with the barred window. Hagerman tells the 
   Stranger that he is scared and offers him money to protect him. The 
   woman in the barred window is Hagerman's wife, Elizabeth (Patrizia 
   Valturri; <B><A HREF="john_the_bastard_1967.htm">JOHN THE BASTARD</A></B> 
   - 1967), who Hagerman says is insane, so he keeps her locked in her 
   room and the window barred so she doesn't escape. The uber-religious 
   Hagerman tells the Stranger that he has no hired help because he 
   doesn't trust them, they steal, and Bill is living in sin with Flory 
   (&quot;That's why the Lord struck down his son!&quot;). While 
   Hagerman does all his racist talking, the Stranger remains silent, 
   eating the meal Hagerman cooked for him and listening to Elizabeth 
   screaming and banging on her bedroom door.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bill orders his gang to kill the Stranger before morning arrives. 
   Flory says it may be a good idea to kill the two Indians that came 
   into town with the Stranger, but Bill says he doesn't care how it's 
   done, he wants the Stranger dead. When night comes, the Stranger goes 
   to sleep in a room in Hagerman's house and we see Hagerman unlock the 
   door to his wife's room and walk away. Elizabeth then walks into the 
   Stranger's room and tells him to get out of town (&quot;Life in this 
   place is worth nothing!&quot;) and she knew he was different from 
   every other person in this damned town. Elizabeth tells him she is 
   not crazy; her husband locked her in her bedroom because she fell in 
   love with another man. Elizabeth asks the Stranger to kiss her and he 
   does. It not too long before we see them making love (After they have 
   sex, Elizabeth looks at the sleeping Stranger and says in a whisper, 
   &quot;My love. My love.&quot;, proving that she just may be crazy 
   after all.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sorrow and his men come into town, tearing up Bill's saloon looking 
   for the gold, but not finding it. Bill tells Sorrow that Hagerman has 
   all the gold and keeps it in his house, so they attack Hagerman's 
   home, the Stranger driving them away by tossing bags of Hagerman's 
   share of the gold dust out the window and firing his gun. Hagerman is 
   furious (&quot;There's a serpent in my house!&quot;) and threatens to 
   get even with the Stranger and Elizabeth, coming up with a way to 
   frame the Stranger for a murder yet to come. The following morning, 
   Bill has a funeral for Evan and the procession walks past Hagerman's 
   house. The Stranger notices that his pistol is missing, taken by 
   Hagerman, who takes advantage of the funeral by searching Bill's 
   saloon for his share of the gold. When Bill and Flory come back 
   early, Hagerman&nbsp; shoots Bill dead and Flory runs away. Everyone 
   in town thinks the Stranger is Bill's murderer, since he was killed 
   with gold bullets. Flory then goes to the Stranger and begs him to 
   protect her, saying she will pay him Bill's share of the gold, which 
   is hidden in Evan's buried coffin. The town posse, led by Hagerman, 
   grabs one of the Indians and Hagerman scalps him (The other very 
   graphic and bloody scene missing from English-dubbed prints) when he 
   won't tell them where the Stranger is. The other Indian warns the 
   Stranger and Flory that the whole town is after them, but before they 
   can do anything, the Stranger is captured and tortured by Sorrow and 
   Flory is shot in the back and killed. Hagerman returns home and tells 
   Elizabeth taht her lover is dead, locking her in her bedroom while 
   the Stranger is chained to a wall and being fed to some hungry 
   vampire bats (!) until he tells Sorrow where the gold is hidden. The 
   Stranger has no choice but to tell Sorrow where it is hidden. The 
   second Indian saves the Stranger by using his flute as a dartgun (!) 
   and killing Sorrow's men with poison darts (He&nbsp; tells the 
   Stranger, &quot;You didn't think this was only good for music?&quot;).
    When Evan's grave is dug up and his coffin opened, the gold is not 
   there. So where is it? The Stranger grabs some dynamite and is about 
   to give The Unhappy Place and its residents a major facelift.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This totally bonkers Spaghetti Western was directed and co-written 
   by Giulio Questi, who only directed two other feature films, the 
   equally bonkers <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DeathLaidAnEgg1968">DEATH
    LAID AN EGG</A></B> (1968) and the strange supernatural tale <B><A HREF="arcana_1972.htm">ARCANA</A></B> 
   (1972; Look for reviews of both films in the near future). He later 
   became known for directing and writing Italian TV movies and 
   mini-series before his death in 2014 at the age of 90. This film 
   takes you places you would never expect and there's a lot of 
   absurdest humor to be found here, as well as some poignant episodes 
   showing us how these people think and act. The Unhappy Place is 
   unlike any town you have seen in a film before or since this was 
   released (it is definitely David Lynch territory, but not as 
   inexplicable). It's not just the adults that act strange but also the 
   children, as we watch a group of children in town playing early in 
   the film, one male child yelling to the others, &quot;I'm uglier than 
   you!&quot;, as if he is proud of that fact. Sorrow is a man of 
   contrasting personalities. Even though he is the main villain in this 
   film, we realize that he is scared on being in the line of fire when 
   the violence erupts. He sends his men to the front lines while he 
   remains in his home, his pet parrot mimicking the clucking sounds of 
   a chicken and forcing Sorrow to fire his gun at it! (I nearly shot 
   soda out of my nose I was laughing so hard!). Equally disturbing is 
   how Hagerman uses religion to disguise his bigotry, but he gets his 
   just desserts in the end when Elizabeth sets fire to his house and 
   the hidden gold dust melts and pours all over his face, turning him 
   into a life-size Academy Award! The Stranger takes a final look at 
   the barred window and sees a burning Elizabeth looking down at him 
   for a final time. It's a scene you won't soon forget. The screenplay, 
   co-written by Questi and Franco Arcalli (<B><A HREF="once_upon_a_time_in_america_1984.htm">ONCE
    UPON A TIME IN AMERICA</A></B> - 1984), is full of these little 
   asides, making this film not only a joy to watch, but also a feast 
   for your brain. There is also some fast-<A HREF="django_kill_if_you_live_shoot_1967.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/django kill italy poster small2a.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>paced
    frenetic editing in this film (also by Arcalli; he also edited 
   Questi's two other feature films), especially the Stranger's thoughts 
   early in the film where he recounts being shot and falling in the 
   mass grave. It will leave you quite dizzy, but also amazed by how 
   well it is done, quite unlike anything else from the time period (MTV 
   would use the same technique much later in the '80s, but not as well 
   as it is done here.). This is a film better seen than described, so 
   you should search this film out, especially the uncut full version, 
   as it is not too hard to find (I will explain where in the following 
   paragraph). If you are a fan of Spaghetti Westerns or are just in a 
   mood for something strange and unique, this is the film for you. This 
   film takes you places a film has never transported you to before and 
   when it ends, you will feel like you have been taken for a ride so 
   fast and memorable, it will soon become a favorite destination of 
   yours. It has become one of mine.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   &quot;Because they're too stupid to use a fork! Ha, ha, ha, 
   ha!&quot;). After ordering a glass of milk and eating a bowl of rice 
   in a saloon, Chin overhears one drunk resident say, &quot;We finally 
   got rid of the Indians and now we're up to our asses in Chinks!&quot; 
   Chin now knows it won't be easy for him in Texas, yet he walks up to 
   the bartender and asks for a fork, just to piss off the drunkards in 
   the saloon. When one of the drunks orders Chin to shine his shoes, he 
   can take no more. He lets out a yell (&quot;Eeeaaaeeaaggghhhh!&quot;, 
   which he will do constantly in this film!) and beats the crap out of 
   everyone in the bar with his martial arts skills.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Chin then walks to the nearest ranch looking for a job, telling the 
   ranch boss that he doesn't want a menial job, he wants to be a 
   cowboy. Everyone laughs at him, but the boss offers Chin a horse on 
   credit if he can do a couple of things better than him, like shoeing 
   a horse and jumping from a fence onto a saddled horse. Rather than 
   using a hammer, Chin shoes a horse with his bare hands (!) and then 
   does an acrobatic jump from the ground to land on a saddled horse, 
   but instead of getting a horse on credit, the boss tries to whip him. 
   (Eeeaaaeeaaggghhhh!) and the boss and his workers fall to Chin's 
   martial arts skill. Chin then takes a horse, promising to pay for it 
   every week on credit (He's nothing if not honest!). An old timer at 
   another ranch tells Chin if he proves himself to be a worthy cowboy, 
   he will have a job. He then bunks with the rest of the ranch hands, 
   who teach him how to play Poker. He wins the first hand after 
   discovering that the deck is marked, which doesn't win him any new 
   friends. (Eeeaaaeeaaggghhhh!) and then beats the snot out of the 
   ranch hands using his martial arts prowess.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Chin then builds up a reputation as a cowboy who can handle himself, 
   so he is offered a job by Stanley Spencer (Piero Lulli; <B><A HREF="god_made_them_i_kill_them_1968.htm">GOD
    MADE THEM...I KILL THEM</A></B> - 1968), the largest cattle rancher 
   in all of Texas, but is Mr. Spencer on the up and up or does he want 
   Chin Hao on his side for another reason? Chin quickly gets the 
   nickname &quot;Shanghai Joe&quot; (which is what I will call him from 
   now on) and begins to work for Mr. Spencer's ranch boss, Craig 
   (Alfonso De La Vega; <B><A HREF="shoot_first_ask_questions_later_1975.htm">SHOOT
    FIRST...ASK QUESTIONS LATER</A></B> - 1975), who tells Joe that Mr. 
   Spencer smuggles cattle in from Mexico so he doesn't have to pay 
   taxes. Joe can live with that, but when he discovers what Spencer 
   really is doing, he can no longer be in Spencer's employ. It turns 
   out Craig and some other people on Spencer's payroll are actually 
   slave traders who smuggle Mexicans across the border to sell them as 
   slaves and cheap laborers. Joe watches as Craig and some of his men 
   heartlessly gun down some illegal Mexicans for sport and, you guessed 
   it, (Eeeaaaeeaaggghhhh!) beats the crap out of Craig and his men with 
   just his hands and feet. A severely wounded illegal tells Joe that 
   this isn't the first time this has happened, so Joe puts him on a 
   horse and sends him back to Mexico, telling him to tell his people 
   that slavery is a lot worse than hunger (Should I put a Trump joke here?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mr. Spencer's men then capture Joe and Spencer tells them not to 
   kill Joe, he has special plans for him.&nbsp; He puts a tied-up Joe 
   in the middle of a bullring with his most violent prized bull. It 
   tries to gore Joe, but he is too quick. Joe knocks out the bull by 
   kicking it in the head (!) and then takes Spencer hostage, dropping 
   him off in the middle of the desert without a horse to teach him a 
   lesson. Joe reports Spencer's illegal activities to Sheriff Andy 
   Corrato (Andrea Aureli; <B><A HREF="adios_sabata_1970.htm">ADIOS SABATA</A></B> 
   - 1970), not knowing that he is on Spencer's payroll, but he quickly 
   learns how far Spencer's reach goes. After his men rescue him from 
   the desert, Mr. Spencer hires four of the best killers to dispose of 
   Joe, offering $5,000 to the first person to bring him Joe's dead 
   body. Each of these killers' specialties can be gleaned by their 
   nicknames: They are Scalper Jack (Klaus Kinski; <B><A HREF="great_silence_1968.htm">THE
    GREAT SILENCE</A></B> - 1968), Burying Sam (Gordon Mitchell; <B><A HREF="seven_devils_on_horseback_1975.htm">SEVEN
    DEVILS ON HORSEBACK</A></B> - 1975), Pedro The Cannibal (Claudio 
   Undari, as &quot;Robert Hundar&quot;; <B><A HREF="#CutThroatsNine1971">CUT-THROATS
    NINE</A></B> - 1971) and Tricky The Gambler (Giacomo Rossi Stuart; <B><A HREF="gunfight_at_red_sands_1963.htm">GUNFIGHT
    AT RED SANDS</A></B> - 1963; one of the first Spaghetti Westerns). 
   Joe finds an ally in beautiful Mexican girl Cristina (Carla 
   Romanelli; <B><A HREF="gang_war_in_milan_1973.htm">GANG WAR IN MILAN</A></B> 
   - 1973), who tells him about the price on his head and offers him 
   shelter, which he accepts. Pedro the Cannibal is the first to try and 
   kill Joe (&quot;I always wanted to know what a Chink tastes 
   like!&quot;), but Joe (Eeeaaaeeaaggghhhh!) and quickly decimates 
   Pedro with his quick hands, killing him. Joe and Cristina then travel 
   to Mexico and stop at a hotel for the night, run by a fellow 
   Chinaman, but he turns out to also be on Spencer's payroll and, that 
   night, Cristina disappears, kidnapped by Burying Sam. While searching 
   for Cristina, Joe falls in one of Sam's spiked booby traps in the 
   desert, but he is just playing possum, beating the stuffing out of 
   Sam (Eeeaaaeeaaggghhhh!), who then dies in one of his own booby 
   traps, impaled on sharp bamboo spikes (Where in the hell did Sam find 
   bamboo in Mexico???). Joe then rescues Cristina and discovers that 
   she is suffering from a &quot;raging fever&quot;, so he goes looking 
   for a doctor. One resident of the town tells Joe that a doctor can be 
   found in the saloon, but it turns out to be a trap, Tricky The 
   Gambler and his men are waiting for him, guns drawn. Joe turns out to 
   be the smarter man, as he forces one of Tricky's men to wear his 
   clothes and when he enters the saloon, he is violently gunned-down. 
   We then hear Joe (Eeeaaaeeaaggghhhh!), as he takes out everyone in 
   the saloon except for Tricky, who offers a fair fight to Joe. But 
   like any gambler, he cheats, forcing Joe to rip out one of Tricky's 
   eyes with his bare hands! Joe then leaves town with a doctor (Dante 
   Maggio; <B><A HREF="run_man_run_1968.htm">RUN, MAN, RUN</A></B> - 
   1968), who attends to Cristina. When the doctor leaves, he is 
   confronted by Scalper Jack, who wants to know where the Chinaman is. 
   When the doctor refuses to tell him, Jack scalps him (offscreen). It 
   turns out Scalper Jack already knew where Joe was, he's just a sadist 
   who loves his nickname a little too much. When Joe exits the house, 
   Jack shoots him twice, but he is surprised to discover Joe is still 
   alive, so he tortures him in front of a tied-up Cristina (Jack has a 
   doll he puts his collection of scalps on, calling it 
   &quot;pretty&quot;!). Jack begins to scalp Joe, but we then hear Joe 
   yell and we know what comes next. Jack is impaled by his own knives, 
   which he keeps hidden inside his jacket. The doctor, who is still 
   alive (!), attends to Joe's wounds and delivers a package to Mr. 
   Spencer. Inside the box is Jack's scalp!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The finale finds Joe facing off with Mr. Spencer, after healing 
   himself using acupuncture so he feels no pain. Joe doesn't know that 
   Mr. Spencer has one final surprise for him. He has hired Joe's old 
   martial arts teacher, Master Yang (George Wang; <B><A HREF="executioner_of_god_1973.htm">THE
    EXECUTIONER OF GOD</A></B> - 1973), who has parted ways with 
   &quot;The Way of the Lotus&quot; (an ancient Chinese code of doing no 
   harm to the innocent) to combat his former student in one final 
   battle. Will thousands of years of oriental fighting defeat Joe in 
   the Wild West? Don't count on it, because Joe cuts off Master Yang's 
   right hand with a sword and then sends his fist clear through Yang's 
   chest until it exits out his back, putting an end to the violence and 
   Mr. Spencer's illegal slave trade. (If you want to see if and how 
   Spencer dies, you'll have to watch the film!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampireInVenice1988">VAMPIRE IN VENICE</A></B> 
   - 1988), starts out innocently enough, but every killing gets 
   bloodier and gorier than the last, making you wonder how in the hell 
   the final battle can get worse than Tricky's eye removal or Jack's 
   scalping, yet it does. Just listen for Joe's yell and be prepared for 
   bloody battle. The final battle between Joe and Master Yang is a 
   doozy, full of slow-motion acrobatics and swordplay, ending with Yang 
   getting his hand cut off and shooting at Joe with a pistol in his 
   other hand. Joe catches a bullet (!) aimed at his heart and then rips 
   out Yang's heart with his own hand, sending his heart exiting out his 
   back. (Cut out of most of the available prints, but not the one I 
   saw!). While the martial arts sequences are very well done, the film 
   is spoiled somewhat by giving Shanghai Joe a normal Texas-twanged 
   voice, without a hint of an oriental accent, making him seem 
   commonplace, not a fish out of water, which would have worked much 
   better in the confines of this film. Also surprising is how little 
   screen time the hired killers are given, leaving very little time for 
   any of them to leave an impression (I would say that Giacomo Rossi 
   Stuart makes the biggest impression as Tricky the Gambler, as Klaus 
   Kinski is horrendously dubbed, destroying any tension that would have 
   been there if they used Kinski's real voice.). But these are just 
   minor complaints, as this is an offbeat little time-waster that is 
   different enough to be entertaining (Gordon Mitchell as Burying Sam 
   sings a funny song as he is hunting for Joe, something he made up on 
   the spot and was kept in the film.).

   one was a PG-Rated foray into trying to find a dead elderly

   of his mistress's asses! The mistresses are played by some of Italy's

   is going to be a change in Salt Flats and there is no place for 
   gamblers, prostitutes, crazy people or drunks in the new Salt Flats,

   never come back to Salt Flats, if they do, they will wish they were

    Stubby tells his new friends that they are going to Sand City,

   That's good enough for me!&quot; He also tells Bud that they have a 
   nice cemetery where he can make new friends and tells Bunny that Sand 
   City also has a whorehouse, so she will have a job. When Clem asks 
   how far away it is, Stubby says two hundred miles, to which Clem 
   replies, &quot;Two hundred miles without a drink? I don't even 
   remember my name!&quot; As they get close to their destination, Clem 
   tells Stubby that Bunny is looking pale and she is throwing up. Yep, 
   she is pregnant and Stubby says, &quot;That bitch is going to hold us 
   back!&quot; Bunny hears him and says, &quot;What are you going to do,

   around for drinking his toilet water (!), but snaps out of it when 
   Clem says, &quot;That toilet water sure smelled funny!&quot; and 
   everyone has a laugh for the first time together.&nbsp; They then run 
   into a group of religious folk from the &quot;Joyful Church of the 
   Living Christ&quot;. The preacher tells Stubby they are from 
   Switzerland and have come to America looking for brothers that need 
   saving. The foursome join the group for a meal and some talk, but

    It doesn't take long for this disparate group to become family, 
   looking after each other and having arguments like any 
   &quot;normal&quot; family (Is any family normal?). They celebrate 
   Bunny's 19th birthday by a lake, where they meet Chaco (Tomas Milian; <B><A HREF="#DeathSentence1968">DEATH
    SENTENCE</A></B> - 1968), an unstable man who is good with a gun. He 
   joins their caravan, but to make sure Bunny is safe, Stubby tells 
   Chaco that she is his wife (Chaco, proving how good he is with a gun, 
   shoots birds out of the sky while on horseback, so they all have 
   something to eat). Three men ride towards them and Chaco kills them, 
   finishing off one of the men by cutting skin from his torso and 
   pinning his badge on his naked chest (a scene missing from most 
   English language prints of the film). That man was a sheriff looking 
   for Chaco, who is wanted for rape and murder. That night, Chaco talks 
   all of them into trying peyote and while they are tripping, Chaco 
   ties them all up and rapes Bunny, as the others watch (Clem is not 
   tied-up, as he is too drunk on Chaco's booze to give a damn). After 
   Chaco is done, he kicks Stubby in the nuts, steals his straight razor 
   and says, &quot;Thanks for your wife!&quot; and goes to leave, 
   telling Clem he is welcome to join him. Clem has a moment of clarity 
   and tries to cave-in Chaco's head with a rock, but Chaco shoots him 
   in the leg instead and leaves. Stubby uses the last of the alcohol to 
   remove the bullet from Clem's leg, only now they have to travel on 
   foot to Sand City, dragging Clem on a makeshift stretcher, since 
   Chaco stole their horses.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Chaco is a real bastard, as he comes back to get some more of Bunny 
   with two of his outlaw friends, only Stubby and his new family hide. 
   Chaco rides away empty-handed and the group continue on foot, only to 
   discover that Chaco and his cohorts have slaughtered the preacher and 
   his flock, including the women and the children. Stubby yells out 
   that the next time he and Chaco meet, he is a dead man. During a 
   rainstorm, they find shelter in an old mine next to a ghost town. Bud 
   sees a cemetery, so he strips completely naked and talks to the 
   tombstones as if they were old friends. Clem's condition gets much 
   worse, as the infection in his leg is spreading, so he grabs Stubby 
   and Bunny's hands and makes them swear that they will get married 
   when they reach Sand City, which they do, then he dies (It's quite 
   touching, as Bud tells him there are millions of happy people waiting 
   for him where he is going). Stubby and Bunny seal the promise by 
   making love. Bud later announces that he caught an animal, so he 
   cooks it and everyone has a hearty meal. In the morning, Bud says 
   that there are people living in the ghost town, but when Stubby goes 
   to investigate, he makes a horrifying discovery: It's Clem's body, 
   missing a huge chunk of flesh from his backside. That's right, the 
   terrific meal that Bud served Stubby and Bunny came from Clem's ass! 
   When the rain stops and it is time to leave the mine, Stubby tells 
   Bunny that Clem left without saying goodbye, but I think we know what 
   actually happened.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    SABATA</A></B> - 1970) helps Stubby and Bunny deliver her baby. The 
   residents of this new town realize that this baby will be the first 
   born in this town, so they bet on whether it will be a boy or a girl. 
   They then hear Bunny cry out in pain and then hear a baby cry, so 
   they start celebrating by shooting their guns into the air, not 
   knowing that Bunny has died giving birth (another touching scene, as 
   Stubby tries to hold back the tears as he tells a dying Bunny that 
   she is his wife). Lemmy holds out a hat to the residents for 
   donations for the baby boy and they happily donate, wondering which 
   one of them will adopt the baby. They ask Reverend Sullivan to 
   christen the baby boy, but he says he can't do it until the baby is 
   given a proper name. The town comes up with the name 
   &quot;Lucky&quot;, which gambler Stubby agrees to (he gives a sly 
   smile) and the Reverend then christens the baby. The question 
   remains: Will Stubby take Lucky with him or will he leave the boy in 
   Altaville? If you want to know the answer, you'll have to watch the 
   film. Did I leave something else out? Oh yes, Chaco. If you want to 
   know if Stubby gets his revenge, you'll also have to watch the film 
   (Hey, I have to give you something to discover for yourself!). I'll 
   just say this: Stubby uses his straight razor for more than shaving 
   (but not in the way you think).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When I discovered that Lucio Fulci directed this Spaghetti Western 
   (this was the second of his Spaghetti Western triptych, the first one 
   being <B><A HREF="massacre_time_1966.htm">MASSACRE TIME</A></B> 
   [a.k.a. <B><A HREF="brute_and_the_beast_1966.htm">THE BRUTE AND THE BEAST</A></B> 
   - 1966] and the final one being <B><A HREF="#SilverSaddle1978">SILVER SADDLE</A></B> 
   - 1978), I was expecting bloody gore, but what I wasn't expecting was 
   a literate and affecting story (screenplay by Fulci and Ennio D. 
   Concini [<B><A HREF="china_9_liberty_37_1978.htm">CHINA 9, LIBERTY 37</A></B> 
   - 1978], based on stories by real-life cowboy writer Bret Harte, who 
   died in 1902). While there is some graphic gore (In the opening town 
   massacre, bullets hit bodies like miniature explosions), the story 
   takes us places we would never expect, as these four contrasting 
   people become an ad hoc family. And just like any family, things get 
   fucked-up, especially the cannibalism angle, which came as a total 
   surprise (at least for me). Watching this film for a second time, I 
   noticed that all the signs were there, pointing towards cannibalism, 
   but you had to pay very close attention to pick up the clues 
   (especially when Stubby first meets Bud in the jail cell). Still, 
   this is a pretty violent film, foreshadowing Fulci's future success 
   as a director of gory horror films, like <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   (1979), <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CityLivingDead1980">CITY OF THE 
   LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1980) and <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE BEYOND</A></B> 
   (1981), just to mention a few. This was made during the waning days 
   of the Spaghetti Western and was not popular in Italy when released 
   theatrically, but it<A HREF="four_of_the_apocalypse_1975.htm#ItalianPoster"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/four of the apocalypse italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   has become a cult item long after Fulci passed away (in 1996). It's 
   easy to see why. It's excellently acted by everyone involved, even by 
   Michael J. Pollard (<B><A HREF="morbid_1972.htm">MORBIDITY</A></B> - 
   1972), who tones down his usual crazy side, turning in a totally 
   humanistic performance. Some of his scenes are very touching, just as 
   the scenes by Tomas Milian are totally frightening (Milian is a 
   chameleon, able to transform any role into something surprising). 
   Lynne Frederick just got married to Peter Sellers when this film was 
   made and her performance here is remarkable, especially her death 
   scene, which hits you with an emotional gut-punch. Her real life was 
   tragic. She died of alcohol poisoning at the age of 39 in 1994. Some 
   believe she became an alcoholic when married to Sellers, who use to 
   beat her senseless before his death in 1980, even though she married 
   English personality David Frost six months after Sellers' death. That 
   marriage lasted less than two years. She was so protective of 
   Sellers' name that she was blacklisted by Hollywood and the 
   filmmaking industry due to her lawsuits against several big 
   production companies for tarnishing her former husband's name. Her 
   mother has gone on record saying that her daughter wasn't an 
   alcoholic, she died of a seizure while sleeping. That was never 
   verified. But, I digress. Even all the background players in this 
   film, especially the residents of Altaville, turn in realistic 
   performances, as they are people with heart and soul, not ones prone 
   to violence as in other Spaghetti Western flicks, so it comes as no 
   surprise when Stubby has to make the hardest decision of his life. I 
   have been admiring Fulci's non-horror films and if you think he only 
   excelled in horror, I would suggest you view this film. It will 
   change your mind. Fulci had talent and it is abundantly clear here.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   a matter of fact, this doesn't play like a western at all. It plays 
   more like some twisted fantasy where our hero is put in so many

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with The Stranger (Tony Anthony; <B><A HREF="blindman_1971.htm">BLINDMAN</A></B> 
   - 1971) being dragged<A HREF="get_mean_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/get mean poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   by a horse through the Wisconsin countryside and across an old 
   rickety wooden bridge into a ghost town. As soon as the horse enters 
   the ghost town, it dies and the Stranger frees himself from his binds 
   (there are multiple shots with metal reflective spheres that I guess 
   symbolize something, but damn if I know what is is!). He walks into a 
   tavern, where an old woman gypsy says to him, &quot;We were expecting 
   you!&quot; Another gypsy pours $10,000 in coins on a table and tells 
   him that the money is his if he will escort Princess Elizabeth Maria 
   de Burgos (Diana Lorys; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HousePsychoticWomen">HOUSE
    OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN</A></B> - 1973) to Spain. The Stranger asks for 
   $50,000 (he has no idea where Spain is!), telling the Princess for 
   that amount of money, &quot;Lady, I'll take you any goddamned place 
   you want to go!&quot; Suddenly, a group of Barbarians enter the 
   tavern (one of them is wearing a horned helmet, like a Viking!) and 
   begin to throw the Stranger and the gypsies across the room (Look for 
   this film's director in a cameo as one of the gypsies). The Stranger 
   gets the upper hand (branding a couple of them with a hot poker) and 
   realizes that this trip to Spain is not going to be an easy one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    They make it to Spain (thanks to footage borrowed from <B><A HREF="my_name_is_nobody_1973.htm">MY
    NAME IS NOBODY</A></B> - 1973), where the Princess shows the 
   Stranger her castle, telling him it was built by the Moors years ago 
   to protect her people from the Barbarians. She then tells him about 
   the &quot;Treasure of Rodrigo&quot;, which gets the Stranger's 
   undivided attention. The treasure is hidden somewhere and only their 
   General, Emir (George Rigaud; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975), knows where it is. Suddenly, they are stuck in the middle of 
   a large-scale battle between the Moors and the Barbarians. A huge 
   battle ensues, the Barbarians using a unique cannon setup (multiple 
   cannons mounted on a revolving lazy susan!) and the Moors using guns 
   and swords (lots of impalements and cut faces). The Barbarians win, 
   the Moors retreating, their General seriously injured. The head of 
   the Barbarians, Shakespeare-quoting hunchback Sombra (co-screenwriter 
   Lloyd Battista; <B><A HREF="stranger_spaghetti_western_series_1967-1968.htm">THE
    SILENT STRANGER</A></B> - 1968; also with Anthony) has to rein-in 
   the brutish Diego (Raf Baldassarre; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Zambo1972">ZAMBO,
    KING OF THE JUNGLE</A></B> - 1972) from killing the Stranger. 
   Instead of killing him, they string him up by his feet and leave him 
   there, the gay member (!) of the Barbarians, Alfonso (David Dreyer; <B><A HREF="fuzz_1972.htm">FUZZ</A></B> 
   - 1972), laughing as they take the Princess prisoner and head back to 
   the castle (Alfonso says of the Princess: &quot;She's not a Princess, 
   she's an ill-bred bitch!&quot;). The Stranger hangs there for hours 
   in the blazing sun, until beautiful gypsy woman Morelia (Mirta 
   Miller; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CountDraculasLove">COUNT 
   DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE</A></B> - 1972) frees him and takes him to her 
   village. He meets a dying General Emir and asks for his $50,000, only 
   to be told that when they find Rodrigo's Treasure he'll be paid. The 
   General dies, but before he does, he mentions &quot;a temple in the 
   mountains&quot; to Morelia. Is this where the treasure is hidden?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Barbarians then attack the village and, once again, the Stranger 
   gets the upper hand, making one Barbarian hold up two other 
   Barbarians by their feet over a steep wall, as payback for him being 
   hung up by his feet. The Barbarian's arms get tired and he drops his 
   comrades on their heads on the rocks below, killing them. The 
   Stranger then rides to the castle, asking Alfonso to take him to 
   their leader (Alfonso says, &quot;Move that animal and I'll take you 
   there!&quot; in his effeminate voice). The Stranger says to the crowd 
   gathered, &quot;Nobody get nervous, because I come in peace!&quot; 
   and then proceeds to talk to the Barbarians as if they were cavemen, 
   offering them beads and other trinkets as a sign of friendship. This 
   only makes Diego mad and, once again, Sombra has to calm him down. 
   Sombra, who quotes Shakespeare's Richard III (He thinks he is the 
   reincarnation of Richard III!), tries to talk to the Stranger, but he 
   has no idea what he is saying, pissing off the hunchback (They really 
   should have used hunchback actor Luciano Rossi [<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH
    SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973] for this role, as there would 
   be no need for extra padding on his back!). The Stranger offers a 
   trade, Rodrigo's Treasure for the Princess, and Sombra agrees, but 
   the Stranger still has no idea where the treasure is. He finds the 
   Princess tied to a rack and Sombra agrees to free her if he takes him 
   to the treasure. The Stranger then sees a very surreal Barbarian 
   party, where a bunch of lesbians are making out, while a group of 
   blind men watch them! (The Stranger says, &quot;Oh, dear God, they 
   got some ugly women in this country!&quot;) The Princess is then told 
   that in order for her to get her hands on the treasure, she will 
   first have to go through the &quot;Trials of Death&quot;, an ancient 
   ritual where danger and death lurk around every corner. The Stranger 
   takes her place and what he goes through next is a real piece of 
   surreal cinema. The Stranger enters a cave filled with coffins and 
   begins to howl like a wolf, as invisible fists punch him in the face 
   (He says, &quot;All you people in those coffins, I don't believe in 
   such stuff, so don't you try turning me into a wolf!&quot;). In the 
   cave, he is almost blown-up and when he exits it, he discovers his 
   whole body has turned black (when he looks down his pants and sees 
   his penis is black, he screams!). He is then chased around by a bull 
   and falls down a crevasse into another cave, where he steals a small 
   gold horse statue. The Stranger then enters an old temple, where 
   Diego is waiting for him, wanting to know where the treasure is. He 
   hands the horse statue to him and says, &quot;But, mister, now you 
   got to get me a doctor, because I turned black all over and I think 
   I'm gonna die!&quot; Diego is not happy and searches Diego and a 
   piece of jewelry called the &quot;Scorpion's Sting&quot; falls from 
   his body. Alfonso, who is visibly frightened, says that the 
   Scorpion's Sting brings death to whomever claims it and hands it to 
   the Stranger. He is then tied-up and placed on a platter of what 
   looks like the world's biggest salad, looking like a pig about to be 
   roasted, a potato in his mouth! Sombra then gets into a fencing match 
   with Morelia and kills her when she tries to run away, stabbing her 
   in the back with his rapier. The Stranger is then roasted over a 
   spit, Sombra saying to Diego, &quot;The flames are very low, so it's 
   up to you whether he be rare, medium or well done!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Alfonso, who is disguised as one of the red-hooded members of the 
   Barbarian cult, frees the Stranger, as long as he agrees to take him 
   to the treasure. Once free, the Stranger turns the tables on Alfonso, 
   making him swallow a large ball of wax (!), and telling him to 
   deliver that message to Sombra. Sombra and Diego force-feed Alfonso 
   like a &quot;stuffed turkey&quot; until his &quot;message&quot; is 
   delivered (WTF?!?). Alfonso eventually passes the ball of wax and 
   Sombra and Diego discover that the wax concealed the Scorpion's Sting 
   inside it (a portend of things to come).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Stranger is tired of all the abuse, now is the time for him to 
   &quot;Get Mean&quot;. But first he is captured by the lesbians, who 
   use him for their pleasure! Alfonso appears and challenges the 
   Stranger to a duel, slapping him across the face and saying that the 
   weapons are of the Stranger's choosing. The Stranger then gives 
   Alfonso a series of slaps and the lesbians pile-on the gay Barbarian. 
   The Stranger says, &quot;What a country. Women are men and men are 
   women!&quot; The Stranger shoots dynamite-laced arrows over the 
   castle walls, causing mass confusion for the Barbarians. When they 
   put the revolving cannons in place, the scared Barbarians retreat, 
   leaving Sombra by himself. The Stranger kills Diego's men with his 
   four-barrelled shotgun (!), leaving Diego and the Stranger to battle 
   it out, mano-a-mano. He pours gunpowder down Diego's throat and, as 
   he convulses, the Stranger finishing him off with his pistol. 
   &quot;You're worse than trash. You're garbage!&quot; says the 
   Stranger, shoving a potato in Diego's mouth. The disembodied voice of 
   the Stranger taunts Sombra, who accidentally discovers Rodrigo's 
   Treasure when an errant cannonball exposes it. Sombra kills Alfonso 
   by burning him alive, as the Stranger approaches him (multiple 
   dynamite explosions behind him, in a very effective scene). Sombra 
   pleads for his life, saying, &quot;I am Richard III, King of all of 
   England!&quot; as the Stranger challenges him to a duel, his cannons 
   against his six-shooter. As Sombra's cannons miss him, the Stranger 
   kills him with his pistol. &quot;The King is dead. Long live the King 
   or whatever they say.&quot; are the Stranger's final words, as he 
   exits this strange country called Spain and returns to America (cue 
   the shiny metal<A HREF="get_mean_1975.htm#TimeBreaker"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/time breaker aka get mean german dvd front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Wow. Just wow. While watching this film (recommended to me by my 
   friend Steven. Thanks Steven!), all I could think of was how it 
   resembled Sam Raimi's <B><A HREF="army_of_darkness_1992.htm">ARMY OF DARKNESS</A></B> 
   (1992; thanks once again Steven!), making me wonder if Raimi saw this 
   film before he made his. Besides horses and six-shooters, this really 
   is not a Spaghetti Western in the traditional sense (or even in the 
   non-traditional sense!), but a fantasy adventure film with Vikings 
   (although we never hear that word), Moors, supernatural elements and 
   above all, a strong gay subtext that is tossed in the viewer's face, 
   something you never see in a Spaghetti Western (or any Western). 
   Director Ferdinando Baldi, who made many Spaghetti Westerns (<B><A HREF="texas_adios_1966.htm">TEXAS,
    ADIOS</A></B> - 1966), as well as the brutal thriller <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TerrorExpress1979">TERROR

   responsible for the film that kicked-off the early-'80s 3-D craze, <B><A HREF="#CominAtYa">COMIN'
    AT YA!</A></B> (1981) and its companion piece, <B><A HREF="treasure_of_the_four_crowns_1983.htm">TREASURE
    OF THE FOUR CROWNS</A></B> (1983), both starring Tony Anthony. 
   Speaking of Tony Anthony, he made a series of &quot;<B><A HREF="stranger_spaghetti_western_series_1967-1968.htm">STRANGER</A></B>&quot;
    Spaghetti Western films in the late-'60s and basically carried-over 
   that character to this film, although with more dialogue. When it 
   comes to really &quot;out there&quot; films, this one is hard to 
   beat. The battle scenes are large in scope (and it needs to be seen 
   in widescreen to appreciate the large quantity of background actors 
   who were hired to participate in the battles) and there is a sense of 
   brutality herein, even though it is basically played for broad 
   comedy. It's also hard to believe that this gained a PG Rating when 
   released to U.S. theaters (distributed by Cee Note Inc., a company I 
   never heard of before), but it doesn't surprise me because many adult 
   themed films in the '70s achieved that rating, deservedly or not. 
   Recommended for both Western and weird film lovers (you know who you 
   are!). As far as I can discern, this never obtained a legitimate VHS 
   release in the United States, making its first appearance on these 
   shores as a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack from <A HREF="http://www.blue-underground.com">Blue
    Underground</A> in 2015 (It was released on DVD and Blu-Ray in 
   Germany under the name <B><A HREF="get_mean_1975.htm#TimeBreaker">TIME
    BREAKER</A></B>). I saw it in widescreen on YouTube (Thanks again 
   for the link, Steven!), which seems to be the go-to site for 
   undiscovered gems like this one. I will be purchasing the Blue 
   Underground disc set because I always want to do the right thing (and 
   BU always delivers the goods in primo fashion). Also starring Sherman

   the best Italian westerns ever made (at least in my opinion), thanks 
   to a talented cast and a literate screenplay. This is one of the 
   films that made me decide to create a Spaghetti Western section on my

    Keoma has arrived home just in the nick of time, saving a pregnant 
   Lisa Farrow (Olga Karlatos; <B><A HREF="taste_for_killing_1966.htm">TASTE
    OF KILLING</A></B> - 1966) from a band of cruel cowboys who are 
   affiliated with Mr. Caldwell (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="mannaja_a_man_called_blade_1977.htm">MANNAJA:
    A MAN CALLED BLADE</A></B> - 1977), the bloodthirsty leader of 
   Keoma's hometown, which he rules with an iron fist. We watch the 
   cowboys slaughter some townsfolk and they are about to kill Lisa when 
   Keoma intervenes (with a well-placed throwing knife). The cowboys 
   tell Keoma that everyone they killed had the Plague, including Lisa, 
   but Keoma is not buying it (he has to shotgun one cowboy in the chest 
   for laughing at him), so he grabs Lisa and brings her to the town 
   saloon/hotel. The people inside tell Keoma to get that woman out of 
   here, she's infected with the Plague, forcing Keoma to kill two men 
   inside the saloon who draw down on him to make his point. He gets 
   Lisa a room and then meets childhood friend George (Woody Strode; <B><A HREF="unholy_four_1970.htm">THE
    UNHOLY FOUR</A></B> - 1970), who taught Keoma how to use a gun and 
   be an expert with a bow. George is now the town drunk, telling Keoma 
   that everything changed when Mr. Caldwell rode into town. He forced 
   people out of their homes, took their land (he may be responsible for 
   bringing the Plague into town, just to make it easier to get people 
   out of their homes and to make the non-infected scared silly), and 
   he's coming after Keoma's adopted father's land next. Keoma is an 
   Indian who, as a boy, survived a massacre at his village (thanks to 
   the witch) by the white man. He was then adopted by William Shannon 
   (William Berger; <B><A HREF="sabata_1969.htm">SABATA</A></B> - 1969), 
   but his half-brothers, Butch (Orso Maria Guerrini; <B><A HREF="run_man_run_1968.htm">RUN,
    MAN, RUN</A></B> - 1968), Sam (Joshua Sinclair as &quot;John 
   Loffredo&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Hitch-Hike1978">HITCH-HIKE</A></B> 
   - 1978) and Lenny (Antonio Marsina; <B><A HREF="stranger_spaghetti_western_series_1967-1968.htm">A
    STRANGER IN TOWN</A></B> - 1967), never considered him family, 
   making his younger years pure torture. William tells the returning 
   Keoma that his three sons have affiliated themselves with Mr. 
   Caldwell and he is no longer the &quot;big man&quot; in town, 
   Caldwell now is (&quot;I can't shoot my own sons&quot;, says William, 
   but we get the feeling it won't be too much of a problem for Keoma, 
   who doesn't suffer fools gladly). George (whom Keoma calls 
   &quot;nigger&quot; to snap him out of his drunken stupor) tells Keoma 
   that Caldwell keeps all the &quot;sick people&quot; in the old mine 
   and they are never seen again. Keoma goes to the old mine and 
   recognizes his half-brothers, even though they are wearing bandanas 
   over their faces (to ward off the Plague). It's not long before Keoma 
   takes a shine to Lisa (and vice versa). She looks at him with eyes 
   that can best be described as how the Virgin Mary looked at her son 
   (and that's not a coincidence). Thanks to Keoma, George finally has 
   hope again, so he and the town doctor (Leonardo Scavini, as &quot;Leon
    Lenoir&quot;; Castellari's <B><A HREF="one_dollar_too_many_1968.htm">ONE
    DOLLAR TOO MANY</A></B> - 1968), on Keoma's suggestion, head out of 
   town to find help and get medical supplies. They get by a Caldwell 
   roadblock by George pretending to be dead of the Plague, but the 
   doctor says it may have been easy to leave town, but it will be much 
   harder to get back in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Keoma then faces down his half-brothers, beating the snot out of 
   them one at a time, but when he is giving Butch a taste of what he 
   did to him as a child, Lenny pulls out a gun and is about to shoot 
   Keoma in the back, but William appears and tells Lenny to stop, which 
   he does (there is so much religious symbolism in this sequence, 
   especially a wayward son still listening to his father). Keoma keeps 
   an eye on the town from the top of a mountain (more religious 
   symbolism), watching the doctor and George returning to town with the 
   medical supplies needed to cure the Plague, the doctor telling the 
   brothel owner (Victoria Zinny; <B><A HREF="shoot_the_living_and_pray_for_the_dead_1971.htm">SHOOT
    THE LIVING AND PRAY FOR THE DEAD</A></B> - 1971) that a Federal 
   Marshal is coming to town in a few days to clean things up. The 
   half-brothers come up with a plan to pit Mr. Caldwell and Keoma 
   against each other, knowing full well that Keoma will win and they 
   will become bosses of the town. What the brothers don't count on is 
   that their own father and George will take Keoma's side, causing a 
   lengthy shootout in the middle of town (George manages to kill over a 
   dozen of Caldwell's men with his bow before he is gunned-down, but he 
   still manages to kill the man that is shooting him point-blank). For 
   the good of the town, Keoma gives himself up, but when he watches as 
   Caldwell callously kill William by emptying his pistol into his back, 
   Keoma tries to kill Caldwell, but his men subdue him, dragging Keoma 
   on the back of a horse through town and then tying him to a wagon 
   wheel (Keoma looks like Christ on the cross). The three brothers, 
   seeing their father dead, gun down Caldwell and then take over the 
   town, appointing Lenny as sheriff and rally all the townsfolk against 
   Keoma, blaming him for all the bad that has happened in town. The 
   townsfolk fall for it and leave Keoma tied to the wheel for days, the 
   witch and Lisa the only people on his side. Keoma then disappears and 
   we see him ride to a ghost town with a very pregnant Lisa, who 
   delivers her baby on some hay in a makeshift shelter (I really don't 
   tell you what it represents, do I?). The three brothers ride into the 
   ghost town to kill Keoma and Lisa dies when giving birth to a baby 
   boy, the witch holding up the baby to show Keoma. Instead of killing 
   his half-brothers, Keoma hops on his horse and begins to ride out of 
   town.&nbsp; The witch yells to Keoma, telling him that the baby will 
   die without him, but Keoma looks at her and says the baby is free, 
   concluding with, &quot;He can't die. And you know why? Because he's 
   free. And a man who is free never dies!&quot; as he rides alone into 
   the sunset. THE<A HREF="keoma_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/keoma italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> END.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The parallels to the Old Testament are obvious, but this film never 
   seems preachy, thanks to Enzo G. Castellari's taut direction and a 
   literate screenplay by Castellari, Mino Roli (<B><A HREF="#Matalo1970">MATALO!</A></B>

   Eastman&quot; (<B><A HREF="three_musketeers_of_the_west_1973.htm">THE 
   THREE MUSKETEERS OF THE WEST</A></B> - 1973), based on a story by 
   Montefiori. Great westerns should make you think and this film 
   satisfies on so many levels, not just religiously (I am not religious 
   at all, although I am very interested in it), but also in tone and 
   atmosphere. There's a song titled &quot;Keoma&quot;, sung by Sybil 
   Amarilli Mostert, that runs throughout the film, telling us, 
   sometimes in Keoma's own voice (actually, sung by Cesare De Natale), 
   how things should turn out but, as in life, things don't always turn 
   out the way we hope (Music by Guido De Angelis &amp; Maurizio De 
   Angelis; Castellari's <B><A HREF="father_jackleg_1972.htm">FATHER JACK-LEG</A></B> 
   - 1972). Was Keoma coming home the cause of all the carnage, 
   including William, Lisa and George's deaths or did he give them all a 
   reason to live? It's a complex question that gets an answer here, 
   thanks to Franco Nero's terrific acting (he has never been better 
   than he is here), which is full of little nuances the astute viewer 
   will appreciate. All lovers of the Spaghetti Western genre should 
   have this film on their &quot;must-see&quot; list. It is action 
   packed, has some memorable kills (filmed Sam Peckinpah style, in 
   extreme slow motion) and there is a high-fall stunt that is amazing. 
   It is filmed in one take with no edits, showing a stuntman falling 
   from a tower to the ground below. It took me by surprise because you 
   usually don't see falls from that height in one take, as they usually 
   stop before the stuntman falls on an air mattress.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with a bearded man riding into the dusty town of Red 
   Sands. He gets off his horse, carrying a saddlebag over his shoulder, 
   and walks into the bank, which he holds up with a pistol, complete 
   with silencer (Were they even invented yet?), making the bank manager 
   empty out the safe of all its cash, stuffing it into the saddlebags. 
   He then shoots the manager and bank employees point blank and walks 
   out of the bank. The bank manager, who is not quite dead, stumbles 
   out of the bank with gun in hand and goes to shoot the bearded 
   robber, only someone in the hotel above the saloon across the street 
   shoots and kills the manager from the window. The sound of gunfire 
   alerts the people in the saloon, but the bearded man has a partner, 
   who shoots and kills everyone in the saloon, including the bartender. 
   We then see the bearded man and his partner eating some beans around 
   the campfire (no fart jokes please!), when a horse approaches, 
   carrying a man (or woman) whose face we do not see. It turns out to 
   be a second partner, the one who shot the bank manager from the hotel 
   window. We then see the bearded man and his first partner waking up 
   from a short siesta, only they are not alone. There are highly 
   poisonous (and butt-ugly) snakes slithering on them and they strike, 
   killing both of them almost instantly. We then see the faceless 
   second partner grab the saddlebags, hop on his (or her) horse and 
   ride away. Why is this sequence unusual, you may ask? The entire 
   first eight minutes go by without a single line of dialogue, yet it 
   still tells us more than mere words could ever convey. We now have an 
   unknown killer that uses snakes to get rid of his (or her) enemies 
   and we must discover who it is in this film's rather large pool of 
   red herrings, which are introduced to us after this effective 
   sequence. I'll count them off for you, so you won't need a score card.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Sheriff Lewis Burton (Frank Brana; <B><A HREF="if_you_shoot_you_live_1975.htm">IF
    YOU SHOOT...YOU LIVE</A></B> - 1975) and his posse chasing down a 
   criminal named Indio (Ernesto Vanes; <B><A HREF="stranger_and_the_gunfighter_1974.htm">THE
    STRANGER AND THE GUNFIGHTER</A></B> - 1974), who has taken a woman 
   hostage.&nbsp; A gunfight takes place in the hills just outside of 
   Red Sands and Indio gives himself up, raising his hands in the air 
   and letting the woman go free. Instead of arresting Indio, Sheriff 
   Burton guns him down in cold blood (Suspect #1). We then see Lloyds 
   Of London Claims Investigator Jonathan Pinkerton (Robert Woods; <B><A HREF="seven_guns_for_the_macgregors_1966.htm">SEVEN
    GUNS FOR THE MACGREGORS</A></B> - 1966) talking to Sheriff Burton, 
   telling him his company will not pay the bank's claim until he finds 
   out the identity of the third person involved in the robbery/murders, 
   believing it was an inside job by a bank employee. Sheriff Burton 
   doesn't believe Jonathan is who he says he is because he doesn't 
   sound British, Jonathan showing the Sheriff his papers and telling 
   him he moved to London from the States when he was sixteen. News 
   spreads quickly of Jonathan's arrival and everyone he meets calls him 
   &quot;Mr. London&quot;. Jonathan registers at the only hotel within a 
   hundred miles, but why does the desk clerk look at him with hate in 
   his eyes (Suspect #2)? While Jonathan is making himself comfortable 
   in his hotel room, we see the Sheriff and his deputies torturing a 
   prisoner and they want him to talk, but he won't. Does he have 
   something to do with the bank robbery (Suspect #3)? We then watch as 
   a scientist, Dr. Norton (Ernesto Colli; <B><A HREF="red_coat_1975.htm">RED
    COAT</A></B> - 1975), milks some poisonous snakes, the same type 
   that killed the robber and his partner and then writing in his 
   journal. Is he a red herring? Count on it (Suspect #4).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jonathan then questions Mr. Clinton (Ivano Staccioli; <B><A HREF="have_a_good_funeral_my_friend_sartana_will_pay_1970.htm">HAVE
    A GOOD FUNERAL MY FRIEND...SARTANA WILL PAY</A></B> - 1970), the 
   town's biggest cattleman, and asks him if he knows anything about the 
   robbery. Mr. Clinton wants to know why he is being questioned and 
   Jonathan says that since he is such an important man, he would know 
   if anyone new has come into town recently, but he says no, he hasn't 
   seen anyone new in the past couple of weeks. But why does he look 
   guilty about something (Suspect #5)? Mr. Clinton is having an affair 
   with the married Kate (Nieves Navarro, as &quot;Susan Scott&quot;; <B><A HREF="light_the_fuse_sartana_is_coming_1970.htm">LIGHT
    THE FUSE...SARTANA IS COMING</A></B> - 1970), but it couldn't be 
   that could it (Suspect #6)? Jonathan then questions the manager/owner 
   of Red Sand's gambling hall/saloon, Mr. Karl Brown (Carlo Gaddi; <B><A HREF="sartanas_here_trade_your_pistol_for_a_coffin_1970.htm">SARTANA'S
    HERE...TRADE YOUR PISTOL FOR A COFFIN</A></B> - 1970), Kate's 
   husband (and Suspect #7), and offers a $200,000 reward to anyone who 
   can give him the identity of the third accomplice. Karl tells 
   Jonathan that is a bad idea because Sheriff Burton is a new sheriff 
   in town and may not be experienced enough to handle such a situation 
   like this. It seems the old sheriff died mysteriously of snakebites 
   and Sheriff Burton took his position. As Jonathan and Sheriff Burton 
   are walking out of a saloon, someone pins them down with gunfire, 
   which results in a gunfight, the shooter getting away. The Sheriff 
   notices that it was the prisoner he was torturing, but he says 
   nothing to Jonathan, yet he tells his deputy that he better bring 
   back the prisoner he let escape and if he doesn't, there will be a 
   new murder in town: his.&nbsp; Jonathan then talks to Dr. Norton, 
   picking up an important clue (listen closely to their conversation). 
   Jonathan gets into a bar fight with Mr. Clinton's foreman, Fred 
   (Omero Capanna; <B><A HREF="roy_colt_and_winchester_jack_1970.htm">ROY
    COLT &amp; WINCHESTER JACK</A></B> - 1970; and also Suspect #8), 
   while Mr. Clinton, Sheriff Burton, Karl and Dr. Norton have a high 
   stakes poker game in Clinton's office, which seems to happen on a 
   regular basis. After the game, Karl accuses Kate of having an affair 
   with Mr. Clinton, but she lies and denies it, telling Karl that she 
   loves only him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After getting into a comical street fight with four local yokels 
   (totally out of place in the context of the film), Sheriff Burton 
   once again accuses Jonathan of not being who he says he is, because 
   he never saw a claims investigator fight like that, especially after 
   witnessing Jonathan's quick reflexes with a gun when someone tries to 
   shoot him while getting a shave, the gunman's bullet hitting and 
   killing the barber (The Sheriff says to Jonathan, &quot;Looks like we 
   need a new barber.&quot;!). Is Jonathan really someone else? (If you 
   do not want to know, don't look up the credits on IMDb!)</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There are several attempts on Jonathan's life, especially when he 
   discovers Clinton's branding iron matches the brand on one of the 
   bank robber's horses. Is it possible that Clinton is the unknown 
   accomplice or is someone setting him up? As a matter of fact, anyone 
   in town could be the accomplice, as everyone has a reason for needing 
   a large sum of cash, including Clinton, whose cattle business is 
   failing. The Sheriff warns Jonathan to drop the $200,000 reward 
   because it will only bring trouble. So who is the accomplice?&nbsp; 
   We know it's not Dr. Norton, because Jonathan finds him dead, bitten 
   by a snake, but not one of his own, who were milked of all their 
   poison. It's also not Karl or Kate, as Jonathan finds Karl hanging 
   from his neck in Clinton's office and Kate laying dead on the floor. 
   The killer knocks out Jonathan, takes his gun and shoots Karl's dead 
   body, putting Jonathan's gun back in his holster and making it look 
   like a murder. The Sheriff arrests Jonathan, but he knows he is not 
   the killer. Fred walks into the Sheriff's office and guns down the 
   Sheriff, throwing Jonathan the keys to his jail cell and telling him 
   to get<A HREF="kill_the_poker_player_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kill the poker player italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   immediately out of town. Is this a set-up? So, just who is the deadly 
   accomplice? Since the suspect pool is down to two, it should not be 
   hard to figure out, or is it? If you paid attention to this review, 
   you will have all the clues you need to unmask the culprit.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    There is actually a decent mystery to go along with all the 
   Spaghetti Western trappings. Director/co-screenwriter Mario Bianchi (<B><A HREF="fasthand_1973.htm">FASTHAND</A></B>

   - 1989), who is credited as &quot;Frank Bronston&quot; on some 
   prints, uses many giallo tropes, like seeing the murders from the 
   killer's POV, people who we thought were dead that really aren't, the 
   killer's unusual murder tool, rooms full of shadows and other 
   ingredients, making this a tasty giallo western. There's also a tense 
   scene during the conclusion, where Jonathan, the killer and other 
   people are trapped in a room full of poisonous snakes that strike, 
   causing a couple of surprising deaths, proving that old adage: Don't 
   cheat death and expect to live. When work in Italian genre films 
   dried up, Bianchi would give up directing straight genre films in the 
   late-'80s and start directing porn! It should come as no surprise 
   that the giallo elements work here, since the screenplay was 
   co-authored by Luis G. de Blain, who supplied the screenplays to <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#MurderMansion1972">THE

    We watch convicted murderer Bart (Corrado Pani; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WatchMeKill1977">WATCH

   being escorted out of the sheriff's office to a makeshift gallows, 
   where he happily sticks his neck in the noose, while a priest gives 
   him last rites and the widow (Mirella Pamplili; <B><A HREF="cry_of_death_1968.htm">CRY
    OF DEATH</A></B> - 1968) of one of Bart's victims watches the show, 
   along with the rest of the town. A gang of Mexican banditos then 
   rides into town, shooting and killing everyone in the streets and 
   killing the two sheriff's deputies standing on either side of Bart 
   (fuzzy psychedelic rock, almost Jimmy Hendrix-like, plays on the 
   soundtrack, giving this sequence a very eerie feel). They then free a 
   smiling Bart, who goes to the sheriff's office to collect his weapons 
   (instead of wearing a hip holster like most gunfighters of the 
   period, he wears a pair of shoulder holsters) and a key. He uses the 
   key to open a desk drawer, which contains a bag of money. The widow 
   appears, pointing a pistol at Bart, but instead of shooting him, Bart 
   gives her a passionate kiss (while he opens the drawer and takes the 
   bag) and then walks away.&nbsp; As Bart is leaving town with the 
   banditos, we hear a gunshot and see that the widow has committed 
   suicide with the pistol, as we see all the dead people littering the 
   streets, the priest now giving them the last rites.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Bart and the banditos part ways at a fork in the road, one road 
   leading to Mexico and the other to Colorado. Bart give the head 
   bandito the bag of money and they ride off to Mexico, but Bart pulls 
   out his rifle and shoots all the banditos in the back (kissing his 
   rifle affectionately when he is done), going to the body of the head 
   bandito and taking back the bag of money. Bart then introduces 
   himself to the audience, saying he will never forget the words his 
   father told him: &quot;Money is everything. It's love, it's life and 
   everybody steals it. Money is like ripe fruit on a tree. All you have 
   to do is stretch out your hand and grab it.&quot; This tells us all 
   we really need to know about Bart. He enjoys murdering people and 
   money is more important to him than anything else.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bart then meets his two partners in crime, Phil (Luis Davila; <B><A HREF="dynamite_jim_1966.htm">DYNAMITE
    JIM</A></B> - 1966) and the mute Ted (Antonio Salines) and they 
   travel up the road to Colorado to Phil's secret hideout, a ghost town 
   formerly known as Benson City. To get there they must pass a 
   cemetery, full of Benson family tombstones (pay close attention to 
   the names and dates on the tombstones, it tells you all you need to 
   know about the Benson family). Bart is so tired, he nearly falls off 
   his horse, not noticing how creepy this ghost town is (the filmmakers 
   got very lucky and filmed a miniature sand twister happening in the 
   streets of the ghost town. It's eerie and creepy).&nbsp; The 
   questions soon become: Why did Phil choose this ghost town as his 
   hideout and why are the horses so skittish? When Bart makes his way 
   to the saloon/hotel to look for a place to sleep, he finds Phil and 
   Ted are already in a deep slumber. Later on, Bart takes a much needed 
   bath in the horse's water trough (!) and sees the beautiful Mary 
   (Claudia Gravy; <B><A HREF="john_the_bastard_1967.htm">JOHN THE BASTARD</A></B> 
   - 1967), Phil's girlfriend, ride into town, pulling a pack mule 
   behind her&nbsp; (you can tell by the look on Ted's face that he 
   doesn't trust her, or he is jealous of Phil). When night comes, Mary 
   throws Ted's chain through a bedroom window at Bart to stop him from 
   making a grating creaking noise as he sits and rocks on a child's 
   swing (it becomes obvious after a while that Bart gets off on getting 
   on people's nerves). The next morning, Mary flags down a passing 
   stagecoach, pretending to be a lost woman who needs a ride. She then 
   shoots one of the coachmen, but the stagecoach takes off, as Bart, 
   Phil and Ted chase after it, firing their pistols at the men who are 
   shooting back. Bart is apparently shot and killed during the chase, 
   but who shot him? Phil and Ted stop the stagecoach and find everyone 
   inside it are dead, except for a young boy and his father. Ted shoots 
   and kills the father while the son watches (Phil calls Ted 
   &quot;Matalo&quot;, which is Spanish for &quot;kill it&quot;). When 
   Mary arrives at the stagecoach on Bart's horse and tells them that 
   Bart is dead, Phil puts the boy on a horse to find his own way to 
   civilization, while Ted and Phil take the box containing the Army 
   payroll and they all head back to the ghost town, not even checking 
   to see if Bart is actually dead, leaving his body to rot in the 
   blazing son. We then see a young man named Ray Hanson (Lou Castel; <B><A HREF="bullet_for_the_general_1967.htm">A
    BULLET FOR THE GENERAL</A></B> - 1967) wake up in the barren land 
   and ride to the ghost town. Just who is this mysterious person, who 
   carries a bunch of boomerangs (!) with him? Is it possible that the 
   spirit of Bart has entered his body or is there a more down-to-Earth 
   explanation? The next morning, someone walks off with the box 
   containing the Army payroll, right under Phil, Ted and Mary's noses 
   and they become wary of each other, believing one of them is the 
   thief. Is Bart responsible or are supernatural forces at work?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Phil finds an old woman living in one of the ghost town's decrepit 
   buildings. He name is Gertrude Benson (Ana Maria Noe; <B><A HREF="sabata_1969.htm">SABATA</A></B> 
   - 1969) and this ghost town was once her family's home. Gertrude's 
   house is full of valuable relics (including a gold harp) and 
   expensive clothing, which Mary tries on, much to Gertrude's 
   displeasure. Another young woman then enters the ghost town (this 
   &quot;ghost town&quot; is teeming with people!). Her name is Bridget 
   (Anamaria Mendoza; <B><A HREF="up_the_macgregors_1967.htm">UP THE MACGREGORS</A></B> 
   - 1967) and she finds Ray passed out next to Bart's horse. Ted and 
   Phil torture Ray to find out why he is here, but Ray tells them he 
   has no idea how he ended up in this ghost town (his torture is 
   painful to watch). But who is the other stranger in town (all we see 
   is his rifle)? Could it be Bart?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This extremely strange Spaghetti Western, directed by Cesare 
   Canevari (<B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#GestapoLastOrgy1977">THE
    GESTAPO'S LAST ORGY</A></B> - 1977) and written by Eduardo Manzanos (<B><A HREF="seven_pistols_for_a_massacre_1967.htm">SEVEN

   -1976) and Nino Ducci (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#YoungViolentDan1976">YOUNG,
    VIOLENT, DANGEROUS</A></B> - 1976), is full of weird camera angles, 
   creepy psychedelic music (by Mario Migliari; <B><A HREF="tharus_son_of_attila_1962.htm">THARUS,
    SON OF ATTILA</A></B> - 1962) and fucked-up situations, such as Mary 
   swinging back and forth on the child's swing while holding a knife 
   above a prone Ray, acting like a western version of Poe's The Pit And 
   The Pendulum. As a matter of fact, this film is full of Gothic 
   horror-styled sequences, from the creepy ghost town, which seems to 
   be alive, to the unseen horrors that await Ted, Phil and Mary and the 
   torture they put Ray through (including Ted whipping Ray with his 
   long chain and refusing to give him water as he is tied to a pole in 
   the blazing sun). This film is also rich in symbolism, including the 
   gold harp,<A HREF="matalo_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/matalo dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   which seemingly plays by itself (Are angels involved?) and the 
   child's swing, which we see moving on its own (Are ghosts involved?). 
   This film can best be described as a Gothic horror western, 
   especially when we see a tied-up Ray hiding from Ted in a room thick 
   with cobwebs or the scene where Ted mercilessly whips Ray with his 
   chain until Bart's horse attacks Ted, stomping him unconscious. We 
   really don't know what is happening until the very end, where every 
   question is answered and the explanation is a doozy. Some questions 
   are answered outright (Is Bart alive?) and some are cleverly hidden 
   among the symbolism (Who exactly is Ray?). We also learn that Ted is 
   not actually mute, he just doesn't have much to say (!) as the film 
   concludes with the pack mule standing in the middle of the ghost 
   town, the box containing the Army payroll strapped to its back, as 
   all the parties, including Gertrude, shoot it out to see who gets to 
   it first (Gertrude wants the money to restore her town to its former 
   glory). <B>Warning: SPOILERS!!!</B> The conclusion is properly 
   fitting and outright full-tilt gonzo, as Ray throws his boomerangs 
   (!) to kill a hiding Ted and disarm a still-alive Bart (Mary, Phil 
   and Gertrude die during the shootout). <B>END OF SPOILERS!!!</B> The 
   finale is all too weird to describe, so I hope I have convinced you 
   to search for this film and put it on your &quot;must see&quot; list. 
   Believe me, it's worth it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Mario Migliari's music soundtrack, full of fuzzy guitar work, is 
   unlike the music for any other spaghetti western soundtrack. Just 
   listening to it makes you feel very uneasy, which is perfect, 
   considering the story. It should also be noted that the 
   cinematography, by Julio Ortas (<B><A HREF="seven_pistols_for_a_massacre_1967.htm">SEVEN
    PISTOLS FOR A MASSACRE</A></B> - 1967), is very unusual for a film 
   in this genre. The camera keeps moving, sometimes to dizzying 
   heights, never letting you focus on a single image. It also makes us 
   feel uneasy, the same way Corrado Pani makes us feel when he kisses 
   his weapons after every kill, telling us that he loves killing. I 
   could go on and on explaining why this film is so different, but it 
   is best if you witness it for yourself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   never-ending quest for unusual and weird Spaghetti Westerns comes 
   this film, a western political allegory of the JFK assassination, 
   substituting the beginning of the Vietnam War with the end of the 
   Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement with the abolishing of slavery 
   and other meaningful events in U.S. history. Surprisingly, it all 
   works rather well, perhaps too well (I'll explain in this review), 
   and you don't have to have any political knowledge to enjoy it, 
   because it also works as a straight Spaghetti Western, but those who

   James Garfield, but not once does anyone call him by that name, 
   referring to him as &quot;Mr. President) hang throughout the city, 
   proclaiming &quot;Wanted For Treason&quot;. It's quite clear that 
   Texas is hurting from losing the war, especially about losing their 
   slaves, who they used as cheap or free labor to work their farms or 
   ranches. Yes, Dallas is not much different now than it was back then 
   (Kidding! Or am I?), because there is a fundamental difference in the 
   way the North and the South look at black people.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The current President (played by a dubbed Van Johnson; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillerCrocodile">KILLER
    CROCODILE</A></B> - 1989) believes all black people are equal to 
   white people and deserve the right to vote and earn a decent wage, 
   but the majority of business owners in Dallas and other Southern 
   cities, including the Governor of Texas (Julio Pena; <B><A HREF="alive_or_preferably_dead_1969.htm">ALIVE
    OR PREFERABLY DEAD</A></B> - 1969), believe the exact opposite, that 
   black people are beneath them and all they are good for are being 
   slaves and cheap labor (one resident makes a comment that monkeys 
   could do what they do and you will hear the &quot;N&quot; word a lot

    We then see Sheriff Jefferson (Benito Stefanelli; <B><A HREF="viva_django_1971.htm">VIVA!
    DJANGO</A></B> - 1971) and his deputies beating up a tied-up black 
   man named Jack Donavan (Rai Saunders; <B><A HREF="gunman_of_one_hundred_crosses_1971.htm">GUNMAN
    OF ONE HUNDRED CROSSES</A></B> - 1971), a recently freed slave who 
   fought for the North. The Sheriff wants to know about a planned 
   assassination plot against the current President, who is coming by 
   train to visit Dallas tomorrow morning. Jack says he knows nothing 
   about it, he &quot;loves&quot; the President. The Sheriff also wants 
   to know the whereabouts of Jack's best friend and Dallas resident 
   Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma; <B><A HREF="#SilverSaddle1978">SILVER SADDLE</A></B> 
   - 1978), who fought side-by-side with Jack for the North, even though 
   his Father fought for the South. Bill was also court-martialed from 
   the Army by the President for disobeying the orders of a superior 
   officer. Jack tells the Sheriff he has no idea where Bill is, which 
   earns him a few more punches to the face and body. Mr. Willer 
   (Antonio Casas; <B><A HREF="face_to_face_1967.htm">FACE TO FACE</A></B> 
   - 1967) then enters the Sheriff's office and tells him he heard of a 
   plot to blow up the bridge that the President's train has to cross in 
   order to reach Dallas, which will happen tomorrow morning. The 
   Sheriff tells Mr. Willer to go back to his ranch and his deputies 
   will accompany him for protection, not knowing that the Sheriff, 
   along with other prominent Dallas citizens, including bank owner Mr. 
   Pinkerton (Fernando Rey; <B><A HREF="town_called_hell_1971.htm">A 
   TOWN CALLED HELL</A></B> - 1971) and even the Governor, are the 
   masterminds behind blowing up the bridge and killing the President. 
   The Sheriff puts the tied-up Jack in a cell, telling one of his 
   deputies to keep a close eye on Jack because he may be useful in the 
   future. At the ranch, Mr. Willer is brutally murdered by Deputy 
   Wallace (Michael Harvey; <B><A HREF="duck_you_sucker_1971.htm">DUCK, 
   YOU SUCKER</A></B> - 1971), who runs him through with a red-hot 
   poker. Jack hangs himself in his jail cell, but it was only a ruse 
   for him to overpower the deputy and escape, riding to Bill to warn 
   him about the bridge.&nbsp; When they ride to the ranch and Bill sees 
   his father dead, he knows who is responsible and vows vengeance, but 
   first, he and Jack have to stop the bridge from being blown up. While 
   riding to the bridge, Bill and Jack are ambushed by two of the 
   Sheriff's deputies, Jack seriously shot in the leg and Bill seemingly 
   dead. It turns out Bill was just playing possum, killing the two 
   deputies as they come to check on the bodies. Bill wants to take Jack 
   to a doctor, but Jack tells him he has to stop the bridge from being 
   blown up, so Bill rides off to the bridge, promising Jack that he 
   will be back to take care of him. Bill arrives at the bridge, where 
   he kills three deputies and pulls the lit fuse out of the barrel of 
   explosives on the underside of the bridge (Gemma showing us some of 
   his circus trapeze skills he learned when he worked at a circus as a 
   teen). The President's train stops when Bill's victims lay over the 
   tracks and the President, who recognizes Bill, thanks him for saving 
   his lif (Later in the film, Bill tells the President that he harbors 
   no ill feelings towards him about the Army incident, even when the 
   President tells him that he should have had him shot in front of a 
   firing squad!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   hear the news of the President's death, but they get the surprise of 
   their lives when the President's train arrives at the station (the

   prominent citizens in Dallas, as Pinkerton has in his possession 
   &quot;incriminating documents&quot; that could undermine the Vice 
   Presidency and ruin his good name and reputation, forcing him to do 
   their bidding, even though he agrees with most of the President's 
   beliefs and political positions, telling his blackmailers that they 
   should really listen to the President because his policies are 
   beneficial for all of America. They don't want to hear it, telling 
   the Vice President that this President will never be their President 
   because he is ruining the South by taking away all their slave labor. 
   The Sheriff and Pinkerton tell the Vice President that they have the 
   perfect patsies for the President's assassination: Bill and Jack,

    The next day, Arthur McDonald tells the President that this may not 
   be the best time to have a town meeting in Dallas, but the President 
   says that his position demands that he represent all the States, not 
   just the ones that agree with him and the town meeting will go on as 
   planned. At the town meeting, the President tells his constituents 
   that the only way everyone is going to survive this economy of freed 
   slaves working for a fair wage is to raise taxes for the rich, 
   telling rich business owners that they will have to adjust to making 
   less of a profit than they did when they owned slaves. As you can

   city streets of Dallas, a shot rings out from an overpass and the 
   President's body falls into the arms of his wife. Jack, who is 
   looking out his room window, sees where the shot came from, so he 
   shoots at the sniper, but misses (with a rifle provided by Cotton). 
   The Sheriff points to Jack's window and says that he is the assassin. 
   Jack is immediately arrested, while a still alive President is 
   brought to Dr. Strips' office. Dr. Strip examines the President, but 
   he is quickly replaced by a hospital doctor on Pinkerton's payroll, 
   who pronounces the President dead. Word spreads quickly and Pinkerton 
   and his cronies think they have won, but they still have to deal with 
   Bill and Arthur McDonald, especially when a guilt-ridden Vice 
   President tells Arthur about how he is being blackmailed with 
   incriminating documents. Bill and his disabled friend Nick (Manuel 
   Zarzo; <B><A HREF="cipolla_colt_1975.htm">CIPOLLA COLT</A></B> - 
   1975), who works at the local newspaper (and one of his crutches is 
   actually a rifle, which will come in handy later in the film!), try 
   to discover who actually killed the President (it was Wallace), while 
   McDonald, who may or may not be part of the conspiracy, tries to get 
   his hands on the documents.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Jack is being transported to a more secure prison, he is put 
   on trial in Dallas and found not guilty, based on testimony given by 
   Dr. Strips, who refutes the &quot;official&quot; report given by the 
   hospital doctor, which stated the President was shot at the base of 
   his skull, which would make Jack the shooter. Dr. Strips tells the 
   judge (who is also on Pinkerton's payroll) that the President was 
   shot in the front of his neck, not the back of his head and is 
   willing to swear to it on the Bible, giving the judge no other choice 
   but to acquit Jack. When Bill learns of Jack's prison transport, he 
   knows it's a trap, so he races to Jack, only to discover him dead in 
   his locked prison coach, shot to death by Wallace, who put one of the 
   President's treason wanted posters in Jack's dead hand (For those who 
   think Gemma is a one-note actor, all I can say is to watch this<A HREF="price_of_power_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/price of power italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   scene, you'll never think that way again. The pained and sorrowful 
   look on Gemma's face speaks volumes). Bill finds out about the Vice 
   President's documents and tells McDonald to stay out of his way, 
   because once he gets his hands on those documents, heads will roll 
   and careers ruined, maybe even his. McDonald tells Bill to be very 
   careful because he has no idea who he is dealing with. Is this a 
   threat or a simple warning?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Every time Bill gets close to the documents, important people end up 
   dead, all of them working in cahoots with Pinkerton. The big question 
   remains: Is McDonald on Pinkerton's payroll or is he really working 
   on the side of a united United States? Unlike the JFK assassination, 
   this film has a fitting finale, where all of the guilty are punished 
   and Bill gets his revenge on Wallace. Want to know how it concludes? 
   I'm afraid you'll have to watch the film, but I guarantee this: You 
   will not regret viewing this film, no matter what your political 
   views are.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   loved how this film touched on all the fallacies of the JFK 
   assassination, from the &quot;second shooter&quot; in the grassy 
   knoll to Vice President LBJ's supposed involvement in the 
   assassination (I know Truthers and conspiracy theorists will disagree 
   with me). I also liked how it compared the abolition of slavery with 
   JFK's fight for Civil Rights for all, no matter what color, religious 
   affiliation or (maybe) sexual preference, comparing Jack's love for 
   the President with Lee Harvey Oswald's hatred for JFK, yet both of 
   them were murdered for the same reason: to cover-up the truth on who 
   really did kill the President. Yet this film entertains on so many 
   fronts, from bloody violence, great cinematography using some unusual 
   camera setups (pay close attention to the glass of beer when Mr. 
   Willer arrives at his ranch. It is a great shot using forced 
   perspective.) and other aspects, too numerous to mention. <A HREF="giuliano_gemma_amazon_films.htm">Giuliano

   (1987) -</B> Here's something you don't see on my site often (or at 
   all): A gore Western. No, not a horror film set in a Western setting 
   (I've reviewed plenty of them), but an honest-to-goodness Western 
   with plenty of gore. During the Civil War, a squad of psychotic 
   Southern soldiers murder Indian chief Black Eagle and most of his 
   tribe (they shoot them in the head, stab them in the backs with 
   swords and even decapitate them) and then kidnap the Chief's 
   beautiful daughter, Yarin (Mapy Galan; <B><A HREF="city_of_lost_children_1995.htm">CITY
    OF LOST CHILDREN</A></B> - 1995). She eventually escapes from the 
   psychotic gang, which makes the squad's leader, Gordon (&quot;Albert 
   Farley&quot;; who, using his real name, Alberto Farnese, appeared in <B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">NO

   Hondo to track her. Yarin ends up at the ranch owned by Matt (Vassili 
   Karis; who, as &quot;Vic Karis&quot; starred in <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Arena1973">THE

    to kill him because he is a white man. We find out Matt's wife was 
   raped and killed by Indians, yet he still protects Yarin from Gordon 
   (he shoots and kills Hondo for being nosey) and his men. Matt was 
   once Gordon's lieutenant, but he quit because he got tired of all the 
   needless killing. Yarin and Matt begin to depend on each other and 
   they'll need the comraderie as Gordon and his squad surround Matt's ranch.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Matt and Yarin sneak out of the ranch and escape (Yarin scalps one 
   of Gordon's men and slits the throat of another when they make their 
   retreat), with Gordon and his men not far behind. Yarin catches-up 
   with the remaining survivors of her tribe and Matt must fight a young 
   buck to prove his worth. Matt does just that and he and the tribe 
   manage to thin Gordon's squad one man at a time, but Matt is shot and 
   seriously wounded, which slows their progress. They avoid detection, 
   which again pisses-off Gordon (he whips one of his own men in anger). 
   Matt makes a miraculous recovery (thanks to Yarin's Indian medicine), 
   but gets captured by Gordon and tortured by having two hooks attached 
   to his chest while Gordon's men tug at them with ropes. Yarin goes on 
   the warpath, scalping, skewering and blowing-up Gordon's men, until 
   only Gordon is left. We then learn the real truth of how Matt's wife 
   died and justice is done, leaving Yarin and Matt to live a long and 
   happy life.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Directed by late Italian sleasemeister Bruno Mattei (Using the

   as Claudio Fragasso [<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Monster Dog">MONSTER
    DOG</A></B> - 1985], who was Assistant Director on this film using 
   his normal pseudonym &quot;Clyde Anderson&quot;. Why would someone be

   sense.), <B><A HREF="scalps_1987b.htm">SCALPS</A></B> is bound to 
   upset anyone who whistles &quot;Dixie&quot; on a regular basis. 
   Southerners are portrayed as murderous, women-raping perverts who 
   think nothing of killing innocent Indian women and children and 
   proudly hang their severed heads on their horses.&nbsp; Since this is 
   an Italian film, it's an equal-opportunity offender, as most of the 
   Indians (actually Italians wearing greasepaint) are seen either 
   holding scalps or scalping every white man they encounter, whether 
   they are a threat or not. There's not much meat to the plot, which 
   was written by Mattei and Robert Di Girolamo (with a co-story credit 
   going to actor Richard Harrison [<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Blood Debts">BLOOD
    DEBTS</A></B> - 1983], who doesn't appear in this film). It's just 
   basically a long chase film, but the final 30 minutes is a non-stop 
   gorefest. Gordon performs a nasty scalping on a helpless Indian; 
   Yarin shoots people through the neck and other body parts with her 
   bow (she even blows one guy apart with an arrow/dynamite combo); 
   Gordon shoots his own wife in the head for betraying him and Matt 
   gets his ultimate payback by scalping Gordon, when he learns that 
   Gordon, who was Matt's wife's father, killed his own daughter when he 
   tried to rape her, then blamed her death on the Indians. The hardest 
   scene to watch is when Matt has two hooks (which look like eagle 
   claws) pierce his chest and Gordon's guys pull on them in opposite 
   directions, kind of what happened to Richard Harris in <B><A HREF="man_called_horse_1970.htm">A
    MAN CALLED HORSE</A></B> (1970). The easiest parts to watch in this 
   film are the plentiful nude scenes of the beautiful Mapy Galan. Bruno

    The film opens with a young boy named Roy Blood and his father 
   confronting Luke, a hired gun for Mr. Barrett. The father tells Luke 
   that Mr. Barrett cheated him out of a hundred dollars for land that 
   didn't exist and he wants the money back, it was all the money that 
   he had. Luke tells him if he really needs money, he should have his 
   wife work in the whorehouse. This makes the father mad, so he pulls 
   out his rifle and goes to shoot Luke, only to discover Luke is very 
   fast on the draw, shooting and killing him in front of his young son. 
   What Luke doesn't expect is young Roy Blood picking up the rifle and 
   shooting him in the back, killing him. Roy then steals Luke's horse, 
   including his beautiful silver-studded saddle, riding off in the 
   sunset. We then pick up about twenty years later, where &quot;Two 
   Strike&quot; Snake (Geoffrey Lewis; <B><A HREF="shoot_the_sun_down_1978.htm">SHOOT
    THE SUN DOWN</A></B> - 1976) is rifling through the bodies of the 
   dead victims of a stagecoach massacre, taking all their valuables and 
   pocketing them (He makes a living by robbing the dead). We then see 
   someone in a silver saddle riding up to Snake and asking him if he 
   was responsible for the massacre and Snake says no, they are the 
   victims of notorious outlaw Garrincha and his gang, a few of the gang 
   lying dead beside their victims. We then see that the man on the 
   saddle is an adult Roy Blood (<A HREF="late breaking news.htm#Giuliano Gemma">Giuliano
    Gemma</A>; <B><A HREF="#PriceOfPower1969">THE PRICE OF POWER</A></B> 
   - 1969), who is a well-known gunfighter, only he kills people who 
   deserve it. It turns out one of Garrincha's gang is not dead, so 
   Snake shoots him two times, telling Roy that now he knows why they 
   call him &quot;Two Strike&quot;, it takes him two gunshots to kill a 
   person. He tells Roy he is going to shadow him for a while, because 
   he has the feeling that he will have more dead bodies to steal from, 
   Roy's reputation is well known to him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Roy then rides into town and goes to the saloon, where he meets old 
   friend Miss Sheba (Licinda Lentini), the owner and proprietor of the 
   town whorehouse. She tells him about a man named Shep, who is making 
   her pay to keep her whorehouse open, if she doesn't, he will burn it 
   down and put all her whores out of business. Roy rides to where Shep 
   hangs out and when he confronts him, he has no choice but to gun him 
   and his two friends down (Snake is waiting there to rifle through 
   their dead bodies). A man named Turner (Gianni De Luigi) walks up to 
   Snake and tells him to tell Roy that if he wants to kill Mr. Barrett, 
   he should go to the cemetery tomorrow morning, Barrett goes there 
   every month and he will be carrying a bouquet of flowers. He tells 
   Roy and he goes to the cemetery, only the only person carrying 
   flowers is a young boy (Sven Valsecchi; <B><A HREF="street_people_1976.htm">STREET
    PEOPLE</A></B> - 1976), but there are gunmen hiding behind some 
   tombstones that have the young boy in their sights. Roy guns them all 
   down (one is graphically shot in the temple) and rescues the boy, 
   riding out of the cemetery. They stop at a well in the middle of 
   nowhere and Roy asks the young boy his name. He tells Roy his name is 
   Thomas Barrett Jr. and that it is his father he visits every month, 
   placing flowers on his grave. When Roy hears his name, he leaves the 
   boy where he is and rides away, giving him his knife and a canteen of 
   water. As he is riding away, he hears Thomas scream and rides back to 
   the boy, only to discover he killed a snake by throwing Roy's knife 
   at it. When Roy asks him why he screamed, he tells him it is 
   something his father taught him, screaming lets him concentrate on 
   the target (He gives Roy a demonstration and when he screams, Roy's 
   horse bolts, knocking him off the horse!). Roy brings young Thomas to 
   an abandoned old church, where Roy and Snake get into a gunfight with 
   Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell; <B><A HREF="#TexLordDeep1985">TEX AND THE 
   LORD OF THE DEEP</A></B> - 1985; also starring Gemma) and his gang. 
   Vastly outnumbered, Roy gets an idea when he spots a barrel of 
   carbide near him. He sends Snake out (in the middle of the gunfight), 
   to fill up a bunch of canteens with water from the well (Snake is 
   pinned down at the well, so Roy uses Snake's sawed-off shotgun to 
   blow a hole in the side of the well, where water leaks out and Snake 
   fills up the canteens). When Roy gets the canteens, he puts some 
   carbide in them and throws them towards the gang, where he shoots the 
   canteens and they explode, but it would be more productive if Snake 
   climbed the church's bell tower so he can throw them farther. The 
   boards are too rotten to hold Snake's weight, so young Thomas offers 
   to climb it and throw the canteens. Roy doesn't want him to do it, 
   but Snake convinces him otherwise and Thomas climbs the bell tower 
   throws the canteens and Roy shoots them, forcing Garrincha and the 
   remainder of his gang retreat and ride away, promising to return and 
   get even (Snake rifles through all the dead bodies). The question 
   becomes: Why does everyone want young Thomas dead?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Thomas wants to stay with Roy, but he doesn't think that would be a 
   good idea, but Thomas convinces him, saying it would be safer to stay 
   with him than being home. The only thing Thomas wants Roy to do is 
   call him by his name, rather than continually calling him &quot;Pee 
   In The Pants.&quot; Roy agrees, calls him Thomas and the boy then 
   kisses Roy on the cheek (a very touching scene). Thomas' uncle, Mr. 
   Barrett (Ettore Manni; <B><A HREF="starblack_1966.htm">STARBLACK</A></B> 
   - 1966), offers a reward of $5,000 for the death of Roy Blood, whom 
   he thinks has kidnapped his nephew. Roy contacts Thomas' sister 
   Margaret (Cinzia Monreale; Fulci's <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE BEYOND</A></B> 
   - 1981) to tell her that her brother is safe, but she shows him a 
   ransom note, supposedly written by him, asking for $5,000 for the 
   safe return of Thomas. Roy tells her he never wrote the note and 
   saying to her he is going to kill Turner for deceiving him and almost 
   getting him killed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Roy returns to Thomas and Snake, Thomas shoots his hat off with 
   Snake's sawed-off shotgun (he didn't know it was Roy), making Roy 
   slap Thomas in the face for almost killing him. He then discovers 
   that Thomas has hogtied Snake (!) and finds out that Snake wrote that 
   ransom note, telling Roy that he was going to split the money with 
   him (Sure!). Roy runs off Snake and tells him that he never wants to 
   see him again. Roy apologizes to Thomas for slapping him and tells 
   him about his life as a boy. Thomas tells Roy that if he killed as a 
   boy, he must have had a good reason (Thomas is smarter than he has 
   any reason to be). They become close, closer than Roy has been with 
   anyone since his father. Roy then hides Thomas at Miss Sheba's 
   whorehouse (!), where Thomas tells whore Janice (Agnes Kalpagos; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#AchtungDesertTigers">ACTUNG!
    THE DESERT TIGERS</A></B> - 1977) that he wants his sister Margaret 
   to buy this (whore)house, because he'd love to come here when it 
   pleased him (Like I said, he's wise beyond his years!). The whores 
   treat Thomas with love and affection, but why does Thomas cry when 
   Janice leaves the room?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   men and he learns if Thomas dies, Margaret inherits their father's 
   fortune. He also learns that Turner has an eye for Margaret and if he 
   plays his cards right, Margaret will marry him and he wil wind up 
   with the whole Barrett fortune in his lap (Thomas' uncle gambled away 
   his half of the Barrett fortune and is now broke). Turner is gambling 
   downstairs in the saloon and Roy wants to kill him now, but Miss 
   Sheba begs him not to, it will give the whorehouse a bad name (!). 
   Thomas tries to sneak out of the whorehouse alone, but when he opens 
   a door, he sees Turner with a whore. Turner tells the Sheriff 
   (Philippe Hersent; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE SLASHER</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">...</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">IS

   Thomas is in the building, but Roy sneaks him out and leaves him with 
   a pistol-packing monk at the San Jacinto Mission.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Margaret begins to see Turner's real colors when he tries to force 
   himself on her, but Roy intervenes. Turner uses Margaret as a shield, 
   which leads to a gunfight between Roy and Turner and some of 
   Barrett's men. Margaret saves Roy's life when she shoves Turner as he 
   is about to gun Roy down and he shoots Turner dead. Mr. Barrett 
   vouches for Roy to the Sheriff and Roy tells them where Thomas is. 
   Unfortunately, Garrincha is also heading there, but how did he know? 
   When Roy, Margaret, Mr. Barrett, the Sheriff and some of his men get 
   to the mission, they find all the monks dead and a badly-written 
   ransom note that reads: &quot;If you want the littel boy, make ready 
   much money for Garrincha.&quot; Roy hands Mr. Barrett the note and 
   the Sheriff arrests Roy, for working in conjunction with Garrincha! 
   We then see Thomas telling Garrincha that he better let him go or it 
   will end up bad for all of them. They laugh, but not for long. 
   Garrincha cuts off a lock of Thomas' hair and hands it to one of his 
   men, then tracing the blade of his knife over Thomas' face. The man 
   hands the lock of hair to Margaret and Mr. Barrett, telling them that 
   if they want to see Thomas alive again, get $10,000 ready. Margaret 
   goes to Roy in his jail cell and tells him about the ransom demand. 
   He tells her not to pay the ransom, thieves are not to be trusted, if 
   they paid the ransom, Thomas will no longer be of use to them and 
   they would kill him. Mr. Barrett tells his right hand man, Fletcher 
   (an extended cameo by Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B> 
   - 1976), that he has some money put aside and he wants him to deliver 
   it to Garrincha, but make sure Margaret doesn't know about it.&nbsp; 
   With Margaret's help, Roy escapes his jail cell, so they set out, 
   with Snake's help (Remember him?) to rescue Thomas, knowing full well 
   that Fletcher is delivering money to Garrincha. Roy was right, 
   thieves cannot be trusted, as Fletcher gets a knife planted in his 
   back and Thomas escapes for a short while (Leaving a flying kite to 
   tell Roy his position). As Garrincha whips Thomas, Roy and Snake 
   arrive and a gunfight ensues. Who will live and who will die?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    As I mentioned before, this is not your typical Fulci film, as it 
   has a very heartwarming story at its core, something you don't 
   usually see in a Fulci flick. Still, this film ends on a surprising 
   note, as Mr. Barrett proves himself not to be as innocent as he 
   pretends to be. It turns out he is the brains behind Thomas' 
   kidnapping (which is how everyone always knew where he was). He never 
   wanted his nephew to survive and Margaret <A HREF="silver_saddle_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/silver saddle italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="309" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>was

   name over and over, but, unlike that classic Western, Roy stops and 
   waits for Thomas to come to him on his miniature horse (!) and they 
   both ride off into the sunset. Since this is Fulci film, some of the 
   violence is very bloody. The bullet squibs are full of the red stuff 
   and there's a gory shot of a bullet entering a gunman's temple in the 
   cemetery shootout. Another thing you will notice here is the lush and 
   colorful cinematography by Sergio Salvati, who also photographed

   (1989; which is why it looks better that it has any right to). Some 
   scenes look like exquisite paintings and the color snaps throughout. 
   While this is in no way an exceptional Spaghetti Western (In fact, it 
   doesn't play like a Spaghetti Western at all, it plays like a 
   standard Western made in the United States), it is required viewing 
   for fans of Fulci, if only to see what he was truly capable of 
   making. It was also unusual to see the late, great <A HREF="late breaking news.htm#GeoffreyLewis">Geoffrey
    Lewis</A> in a Spaghetti Western (his only other one was <B><A HREF="my_name_is_nobody_1973.htm">MY

   of Clint Eastwood's (not a stranger to Spaghetti Westerns, he 
   actually made them popular) films during the '70s &amp; early-'80s, 
   including <B><A HREF="high_plains_drifter_1973.htm">HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER</A></B>

   do anything, be it drama, comedy, be it a bad guy or a good guy. He 
   is particularly good here as a man without a home or any real 
   friends, making a deep connection with a young boy he should hate, 
   but he sees a lot of himself in Thomas and doesn't want the boy to 
   end up like him, a killer (which, actually, negates the ending of 
   this film!). So, should you see this film, warts and all? Damn right

   torture porn, is so nihilistic and grim, you'll want to stab yourself 
   in the eyes to stop watching it, but you won't because it is a well 
   made film. It should come as no surprise that this was directed and 
   co-written by Victor Matellano, who gave us the equally graphic <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wax2014">WAX</A></B> 
   (2014) and the bloody remake <B><A HREF="vampyres_2015.htm">VAMPYRES</A></B> 
   (2015), two films that I also found interesting, not because of the 
   gore, but because they were also well made. Fans of Matellano are 
   calling him the new face of Spanish horror but, personally, I 
   wouldn't go that far, even though his films are professionally made, 
   using actual film rather than digital video.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with the &quot;Colonel&quot; (Pablo Scola) torturing 
   a father who is traveling west with his family. The father is tied to 
   a wagon wheel (a Spaghetti Western trope) while the Colonel kicks him 
   in the head repeatedly, calling him a coward and saying, &quot;The 
   state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual it calls 
   a crime. So let it be so.&quot; We then see one of the Colonel's 
   followers, Red (Maarten Dannenberg), fucking the father's dead wife 
   (!), while the Colonel's other follower, the black Cuba (Armando 
   Buika), holds her dead body prone, laughing like a madman (and 
   setting Civil Rights back more than a hundred years!). The Colonel 
   then finishes off the father with his special weapon of death, a 
   miniature trident-like object with a sharp hook on the shaft, 
   graphically ripping his throat open, his blood flowing like water. 
   Cuba then goes to the dead father and cuts off his right ear, not 
   just the ear, mind you, but all the skin on the right side of his 
   head (!), putting it in a leather pouch with his collection of human 
   ears (later in the film, it is implied that he eats them!). The 
   Colonel then sees the father's young son, who was hiding in the 
   brush, and points his pistol at him, but he doesn't pull the trigger 
   and begins to ride away. Red calls out the Colonel's name and he 
   looks at the boy, saying, &quot;Now you know my name. Sorry kid.&quot;
    And kills the boy by shooting him point blank.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see grizzled old man Ernest (Denis Rafter) trying to teach 
   his twenty-something son Chris (Victor Vidal) how to fire a shotgun, 
   but Chris is a terrible shot, telling his father that he has no use 
   for a gun. Ernest tells him that if he is traveling west (which he 
   plans on doing next week), he better know how to use a gun, because 
   people out there are not so forgiving as they are here. Ernest and 
   Chris are the proprietors of the Black Hell Stagecoach Station, an 
   out-of-the-way station in the middle of nowhere, where stagecoaches 
   stop to water their horses, drop off passengers and have a good meal 
   (All the stagecoaches stop several hundreds of yards away from the 
   station until Chris or Ernest ring a bell telling them that it is 
   safe to proceed.). The stagecoach that has just arrived has dropped 
   off a drunken doctor (Fernando Valdivielso), as well as Liz (Tania 
   Watson) and Anne (Veki G. Velilla), two sisters on their way to 
   Oregon to spread their father's ashes (he was one of the first 
   Americans to be cremated) and to sell valuable parcels of land that 
   their father willed to them, keeping the deeds in a trunk that 
   travels with them. Chris takes an instant shine to the virginal Anne 
   and she with him, but Liz doesn't approve (she is a real tight-ass 
   who is hard to please), telling Chris point-blank, &quot;Don't even 
   look at her!&quot; Little does anyone know, their lives are about to 
   change and not for the better.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Liz and Anne walk to a nearby river to bathe, the Colonel and 
   his minions, as well as a mute Indian girl named Mestiza (Tabata 
   Cerezo), who can't talk because her tongue has been cut out (probably 
   by the Colonel), arrive at the Black Hell Stagecoach Station and 
   almost immediately begin their sadistic brand of torture. Cuba knocks 
   out Chris, Red shoots and kills the doctor and the Colonel holds 
   Ernest's head underwater in the horse's water trough, demanding to 
   know when the stagecoach containing the monthly Army payroll in gold 
   is about to arrive. Ernest tells him that they are never told when it 
   is going to arrive, it just shows up unannounced. The Colonel is not 
   satisfied with that answer, so he crucifies Ernest on a wagon wheel, 
   pounding spikes into his hands with a small sledgehammer, demanding 
   to know when the gold shipment is to arrive. When Ernest doesn't give 
   him a satisfactory answer, he pounds the spikes out of his hands and 
   then uses his special weapon on Ernest, ripping his throat out. Cuba 
   then cuts off his ear, still laughing like a madman. When Chris wakes 
   up and sees his father's dead body, he gives the Colonel a look like 
   he is about to kill him, but he does nothing. Can this pacifist 
   change his ways and become a cold-blooded killer? Don't count on it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, Liz and Anne are at the river finishing their baths, when 
   a man, all bloody and missing all of his fingers, approaches the 
   sisters, but he can't speak because his lips have been sewn shut. Liz 
   cuts the string holding his lips together and he spits out his own 
   penis (!) and dies on the spot. Yes, the sadistic Colonel and his 
   violence-loving Confederate Army deserters got to this man before 
   they arrived at the station. Liz tells Anne that it is lucky that 
   their father taught the how to shoot and begin to walk back to the 
   station, unaware of the horrors waiting for them. The Colonel sees 
   them coming and orders Red to bring them to him, which he does after 
   a short chase. Red ties both Liz and Anne up and looks at Anne with 
   lust in his eyes. When Chris tells Red to keep his hands off the 
   women, the Colonel puts him through a series of tortures no man 
   should ever experience, breaking his ribs by kicking him repeatedly 
   in the chest, making it hard for him to breathe. Another stagecoach 
   arrives, but it is not the one containing the gold. After Chris rings 
   the bell to tell them that it is safe to come to the station, we find 
   out it contains the uppercrust Miss Whitman (Andrea Bronston), her 
   daughter Rose (Nadia De Santiago) and snake oil salesman Zingarelli 
   (Italian director Enzo G. Castellari; <B><A HREF="kill_them_all_and_come_back_alone_1968.htm">KILL

   - 1975; and the classic <B><A HREF="#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B> - 
   1976). Together with the stagecoach drivers, they all sit down at the 
   dinner table and have a meal, while Red watches a tied-up Liz and 
   Anne in another room. The Colonel regales them, quoting from books he 
   has read and telling one of the drivers that he is a 
   &quot;collaborator with the law&quot;, who says to the Colonel, 
   &quot;This is the first time I ever met a bounty hunter that has read 
   a book!&quot; The Colonel corrects him, saying he is not a bounty 
   hunter, but a man who follows the law, his law and always does what 
   is right for himself. Red then starts raping Anne in the other room 
   while Liz watches. Liz manages to free herself and screams, which 
   alerts the people at the dinner table. When one of the stagecoach 
   drivers wants to know who else is here and when Chris pulls out his 
   father's sawed-off shotgun and fires it, missing Cuba by a good three 
   feet (!), the Colonel and Cuba gun everyone down, shooting Miss 
   Whitman point-blank in the face and shooting Zingarelli in the nuts 
   (Words cannot describe the look on Castellari's face as he holds his 
   bloody scrotum!). Rose slips on a pool of blood and breaks her neck 
   when she hits her head on the fireplace mantle, killing her. Mestiza 
   is accidentally shot in the stomach, but instead of putting her out 
   of her misery, the Colonel non-chalantly and without emotion tells 
   her that her death will be long and painful, but he will soon regret 
   saying that. Only Chris is still really alive, because the Colonel 
   needs him for his plan to work, but it doesn't stop him from breaking 
   Chris' left hand by pounding it repeatedly with the sledgehammer 
   (very hard to watch) for daring to discharge a weapon his way.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things come to a conclusion when the stagecoach with the gold 
   arrives at the station. The Colonel makes Chris ring the bell to tell 
   them that it is safe to come to the station, but Federal Agent Tim 
   Rogers (Manuel Bandero), who is escorting the stagecoach, feels 
   something is wrong and tells the coach to proceed slowly and 
   carefully, noticing Chris does not look right. Chris gets some balls 
   and runs to the coach to warn them to ride away, only to have the 
   Colonel shoot him in the back, Chris being trampled to death by 
   horses and then has his head crushed under one of the stagecoach 
   wheels. A huge gunfight breaks out and during the fracas, a mortally 
   wounded Mestiza crawls to Liz and cuts her binds. Anne grabs a 
   shotgun and blows Red's head off (a nifty effect) after Liz stabs him 
   in the stomach with his own knife. Liz then blows the fingers off of 
   Cuba's right hand and then shoots him several times with a pistol, 
   killing him (he even laughs when he's dying!). Everyone on the stagecoach<A HREF="stop_over_in_hell_2016.htm#RoadToHell"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stop over in hell poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   perishes bloodily and when the Colonel sees both Red and Cuba dead, 
   he shoots Anne in the back, killing her. When Liz goes to attack him, 
   the Colonel shoots both Liz and Mestiza, but Mestiza grabs the 
   Colonel's special weapon and give him half a &quot;Glasgow Smile&quot;
    (Google it), before both she and Liz perish. The Colonel, who is 
   mortally wounded, grabs a few bars of gold and rides off into the 
   sunset, but before he gets very far, he falls off his horse, dead, 
   with buzzards circling overhead and bars of gold lying next to his 
   dead body. In this Wild West saga, no one lives to see tomorrow.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Yes, this film is ultra-violent. It is like a western version of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B> 
   (2005), only the torture here is much more brutal. This was made in 
   the wake of Quentin Tarantino's <B><A HREF="hateful_eight_2015.htm">THE
    HATEFUL EIGHT</A></B> (2015) and it's apparent that director Vincent 
   Matellano (who also directed the Spanish documentary <B><A HREF="clawing_a_journey_through_the_spanish_horror_2013.htm">CLAWING!
    A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SPANISH HORROR</A></B> - 2013) follows that 
   film closely, but it is much more violent and gory than that film, if 
   you can believe it. I usually hate torture porn, but this film is so 
   well made, with excellent cinematography (by Daniel Salas Alberola; 
   who also shot Matellano's previous feature films) that details the 
   loneliness of the location, that I couldn't take my eyes off the 
   screen. If I do have one complaint, it is this: Even though the film 
   was made in English, whomever dubbed the Colonel's voice did a 
   terrible job, making his line readings having no emotions at all, 
   like reading a phone book out loud. It makes the Colonel sound like a 
   complete idiot, not the bloodthirsty, sadistic man he really is, 
   cutting down on the tension needed to turn his character into a flesh-and-blood
    version of the Devil. While the screenplay, by Matellano, Antonio 
   Duran and Juan Gabriel Garcia, is pretty standard, I did like the way 
   it played with your perceptions, such as making us think that 
   pacifist Chris would change his ways and get revenge, only to have 
   him get shot unceremoniously in the back. I love films that play with 
   your emotions, which this film does in spades. The station itself 
   becomes a character, as it is so far away from anything considered 
   civilization, it becomes an outpost for lost souls, the last 
   remaining piece of civilization located in the middle of nowhere, 
   where help is hundreds of miles away. I'm a western genre film 
   fanatic and this film satisfies in so many ways, the Colonel's voice 
   being the exception.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   its vault, looking to steal a fortune supposedly put there by Wang 
   (Tung-Kua Ai), but every safe Dakota opens only contains a single 
   photo of one of Wang's mistresses, the photos showing off the 
   mistresses' naked behinds! As Dakota cracks opens each of the four 
   safes and looks at the photo inside, we are given a brief flashback, 
   showing Wang looking at his Italian Mistress (Femi Benussi; <B><A HREF="seven_devils_on_horseback_1975.htm">SEVEN

   open the fourth safe, he uses some dynamite to blow it open, the same 
   time Wang enters the bank wondering what is going on. Dakota tries to 
   stop him from entering the vault, but fails. Just as Wang enters the 
   vault the dynamite explodes and Wang dies, not from the explosion, 
   but from a heart attack. The Sheriff (Barta Barri; <B><A HREF="gunfight_at_red_sands_1963.htm">GUNFIGHT
    AT RED SANDS</A></B> - 1963) arrests Dakota and charges him with 
   murder. He is put on trial and convicted, sentenced to hang by his

   you're alive!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Meanwhile, in China, the Emperor tells Ho Chiang (Lo Lieh; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic1975">BLACK
    MAGIC</A></B> - 1975) and his family that they are going to be 
   executed because he gave Ho's Uncle Wang a large sum of money to 
   invest in America and all he sent back was a wooden statue (It looks 
   like an Indian totem pole. I know what you are thinking, but try to 
   ignore it and go along with the film), but he never returned with any 
   money, so to save face he must execute Wang's family. Just as Ho's 
   mother and father are about to have their heads removed with a sharp 
   sword, Ho shows off his martial arts skills by beating up the 
   executioner and over a dozen of the Emperor's guards. The Emperor is 
   impressed and gives Ho one year to go to America and bring back Uncle 
   Wang's treasure, if he doesn't, his family will be executed. Ho then 
   heads off to America's Wild West, not knowing that he will make some 
   unlikely friends, get into many fights and have the adventure of his 
   life, but will he use his martial arts skills to teach the Wild West 
   a lesson it will not soon forget? Count on it!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Once in America, Ho goes to Uncle Wang's lawyer (Paul Costello; <B><A HREF="death_rage_1976.htm">DEATH
    RAGE</A></B> - 1976), who tells Ho that his uncle had no money to 
   his name when he died, only four photos and a slip of torn paper, 
   also telling Ho that the photos and paper were taken off a thief 
   named Dakota, who is going to be hanged tomorrow. Ho decides to talk 
   to Dakota, but the Sheriff won't let him, saying that only immediate 
   family are allowed to talk to a man who is about to be executed. Ho 
   decides to get himself arrested, which he does (comically) and he is 
   put in a cell next to Dakota. They have a conversation, where Ho 
   finally realizes that his Uncle tattooed four pieces of a map on the 
   butts of his mistresses, the map leading him to Uncle Wang's 
   treasure. Dakota tells Ho he will need his help to find the 
   mistresses since Ho is a fish out of water in America, but before Ho 
   can answer, he is bailed out of jail by Wang's lawyer. Can Ho stop 
   Dakota from getting hanged?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Dakota is led to the gallows, has the noose put 
   around his neck and the floor drops out beneath him, but instead of 
   being hanged, he falls on a horse, put there by Ho. After cutting the 
   rope and setting Dakota free, Ho and Dakota become unlikely allies,

    Dakota discovers that the American Mistress is now the property of 
   Yancey Hobbitt (Julian Ugarte; <B><A HREF="man_called_noon_1973.htm">THE
    MAN CALLED NOON</A></B> - 1973), a sadistic pseudo-preacher, who is 
   actually a cold-blooded killer who quotes from the Bible while 
   gunning down his victims (He is far more deadly than any Hobbit you 
   will find in the stories of J. R. R. Tolkien!). Hobbitt travels in a 
   huge mobile church, pulled by six horses, as he rides from town to 
   town, leaving dead bodies in his wake. Dakota and Ho arrive in the 
   town that is next on Hobbitt's list and get the drop on him in his 
   own church. Ho examines the American Mistress' ass, writes down what 
   he sees and he and Dakota leave, but they should have killed Hobbitt 
   because he is going to make their lives very difficult. When he looks 
   at his kept woman's ass, he knows it will lead him to something 
   important, even though he doesn't understand Chinese, so he joins 
   forces with bare knuckles fighter Indio (Goyo Peralta), who acts as 
   Hobbitt's right hand man, and they try to get to the other three 
   mistresses before Dakota and Ho do.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Dakota and Ho then enter the town where the Russian mistress 
   resides, only when Ho checks her ass, there's nothing there. She 
   tells them they probably want her twin sister, who works at the local 
   whorehouse, so for $10 they get the chance to look at her behind and 
   Ho gets the information he needs and they leave, but Hobbitt and 
   Indio are a step behind, killing the whorehouse proprietor (Manuel De 
   Blas; <B><A HREF="shoot_first_ask_questions_later_1975.htm">SHOOT 
   FIRST...ASK QUESTIONS LATER</A></B> - 1975) before getting a look at 
   the Russian Mistress' ass.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Dakota and Ho learn that the Italian Mistress is now the wife of 
   Lord Barclay (George Rigaud; <B><A HREF="alive_or_preferably_dead_1969.htm">ALIVE
    OR PREFERABLY DEAD</A></B> - 1969), a rich and prominent British 
   aristocrat. It will take quick thinking on Dakota's part to see 
   Barclay's wife's bottom, but he pulls it off and Ho gets what he 
   needs. Then Hobbitt and Indio arrive a short time later and when they 
   discover Dakota and Ho were already there, they brutalize Lord 
   Barclay, forcefully look at his wife's ass and Hobbitt vows that this 
   will be the last time Dakota and the &quot;Chink&quot; will get the 
   best of him, telling Indio that they will get to the Chinese Mistress 
   before his foes, because he has a &quot;plan&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Dakota and Ho come to the town where the Chinese Mistress, Lea Quan, 
   resides, running a laundry with her elderly uncle (The sign on the 
   front of the laundry actually reads &quot;No Ticket No 
   Laundry&quot;!). This is a town Dakota knows well and loves, so while 
   Ho tries to get a peek at the Chinese Mistress' ass, Dakota lives it 
   up at the saloon, having fun with the prostitutes and can-can dancers 
   (If you ever wanted to hear Lee Van Cleef sing and dance [and why 
   wouldn't you?], this is the film for you!). As soon as Ho sees Lea 
   Quan, he is instantly smitten, making him not want to see her ass 
   because there is an instant romantic chemistry between them, so he 
   makes a date with her for dinner and meets Dakota in the saloon. 
   Suddenly, a gang of outlaws, led by Calico (Ricardo Palacios; <B><A HREF="#TexLordDeep1985">TEX
    AND THE LORD OF THE DEEP</A></B> - 1985), enter the town and begin 
   shooting it up, Hobbitt kidnapping Lea Quan and burning down the 
   laundry. Ho manages to pull Lea's uncle from the burning building, 
   while Dakota shoots it out with the gang, taking out about six gang 
   members and noticing Hobbitt holding Lea Quan as prisoner. That's 
   right, Hobbitt's &quot;plan&quot; was to hire the Calico Gang to 
   create a disturbance while he kidnaps the Chinese Mistress, promising 
   Calico a cut of the treasure and telling him that she could translate 
   the other portions of the map that he copied from the other 
   mistresses' asses. Lea's uncle makes Ho promise to rescue Lea Quan 
   and to take her back to China with him, then he dies when Ho makes 
   the promise.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Hobbitt trying to get Lea Quan to translate the Chinese 
   writing, but she tells him she can't understand or read Chinese, she 
   was born in America. Hobbitt doesn't believe her, so he tries to 
   loosen her tongue by hanging her in an iron cage over an open fire, 
   the iron floor beginning to turn red-hot. Meanwhile, just outside the 
   Calico Gang's hideout (an abandoned missionary), Ho gives Dakota some 
   money and tells him he doesn't need him anymore, he'll rescue Lea 
   Quan on his own. Dakota throws the money at Ho, telling him he may be 
   a thief and an outlaw, but he never stops until he finishes a job. He 
   rides away on his horse towards the missionary, Ho asking, &quot;Where
    are you going?&quot; Dakota replies, &quot;Watch me!&quot; and is 
   immediately captured by Calico and his gang and locked in a room. Ho 
   silently enters the missionary while Dakota overpowers the guard 
   watching the room. Ho then meets Dakota outside his room and he tells 
   Ho to go and rescue Lea Quan, but not to do anything until he gives 
   the OK signal (&quot;You'll know when it's time!&quot;). Ho sneaks 
   into the room where Lea Quan is being held and watches her squirm as 
   her cage gets hotter. Suddenly, Ho hears the sound of rapid gunfire, 
   Dakota riding between two horses while firing a Gatling gun (!), so 
   Ho rescues Lea during the commotion. Dakota then enters the room, 
   where he gets the drop on Hobbitt, while Ho gets into a life or death 
   battle with the hulking Indio. Just when it looks like curtains for 
   Ho, he gives Indio a deadly open fist punch to Indio's stomach, his 
   hand going inside Indio's body and Indio falling to his death. Dakota 
   is forced to shoot and kill Hobbitt when he tries to grab a pistol 
   from a dead body.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The finale finds Ho back in China, the Emperor about to cut off his 
   head. Ho tells the Emperor he had Uncle Wang's treasure the entire 
   time, punching the wooden statue and pulling a box from inside it. 
   Inside the box are shares from some of the best American companies, 
   Ho telling the Emperor that the shares are worth ten times what he 
   gave Uncle Wang and they will increase in value as time marches on. 
   The Emperor is pleased and frees Ho and his family. We then discover 
   that Ho has married Lea Quan and Dakota has joined them in China, 
   telling the Emperor that Ho promised to show him China, which he 
   understands is much larger than America and he wants to see how big 
   for himself. The Emperor smiles and everyone lives happily ever after 
   (I think this explains why China now owns a large part of the United States!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    always had a fondness for this film because it was one of the first 
   films I saw when cable TV came to my town in the mid-'70s. HBO aired 
   this film on a regular basis in its infancy and I must have viewed it 
   over thirty times. Seeing it again for the first time in over forty 
   years, it brought on a rush of nostalgia because HBO was nothing like 
   it is now. They only had a small supply of films and this one, along 
   with <B><A HREF="white_buffalo_1977.htm">THE WHITE BUFFALO</A></B>

   &quot;Anthony M. Dawson&quot; here. Yes, this film is comical, but 
   the comedy is not overbearing, as Lee Van Cleef takes his role 
   seriously (even though it looks like he is having a fun time), 
   letting his character kick ass and getting his own ass kicked in the 
   process. Chinese superstar Lo Lieh also handles his role quite well 
   and the English dubbing is also quite good (as usual, Van Cleef dubs 
   his own voice). Very few Spaghetti Westerns handle comedy and action 
   as well as this film does (except for some of <A HREF="they_call_me_trinity_1970.htm">the</A> <B><A HREF="trinity_is_still_my_name_1971.htm">TRINITY</A></B> <A HREF="trinity_and_sartana_are_coming_1972.htm">films</A>),
    as Lo Lieh flies through the air (by using hidden trampolines or 
   reversing the film for high jumps) and some of the violence is quite 
   brutal. As I have said before in the beginning of this review, this 
   was shown edited theatrically and on Pay-TV in the U.S. (under the 
   review title), but the prints titled <B><A HREF="stranger_and_the_gunfighter_1974.htm">BLOOD
    MONEY</A></B> restores all the cut footage, which contains more 
   nudity (mainly women's backsides) and much more bloody violence, 
   including bloody bullet squibs, head shots and more footage of Ho's 
   final battle with Indio, which ends differently in the edited cut. 
   I'm even a bigger fan of this film now than I was as a teen. If you 
   haven't seen it, you really should if you are a fan of unusual 
   Spaghetti Westerns. There's really not anything quite like it and Van 
   Cleef looks like he is having such a ball, it's infectious.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Outlandish and sleazy Spaghetti Western that plays more like a horror 
   film with Western themes (some people call this a &quot;Gothic horror 
   Western&quot; and I wouldn't disagree with them). To explain how 
   offbeat and sleazy this film is, let me begin by saying that when 
   this film was submitted to the Italian Ratings Board for 
   classification for its theatrical release, it was slapped with the 
   equivalent of our X Rating, usually reserved for porn films. Yes, 
   there is some slight nudity in this flick, but it was given such a 
   harsh rating for its overall tone, which can best be described as an 
   air of hopelessness. In other words, I loved it! And it also doesn't 
   hurt that one of the stars is a real-life hunchback, actor <A HREF="luciano_rossi_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Luciano

   He is quickly becoming one of my favorite Italian genre actors, who 
   never received the proper appreciation he so richly deserved (he 
   passed away in 2005 at the age of 70). Rossi never let his hunch 
   interfere with his performance, as he sometimes incorporated it in 
   some of his on-screen roles (as he does in this film, but it is not

    The film begins with Django (Anthony Steffen; <B><A HREF="viva_django_1971.htm">VIVA!
    DJANGO</A></B> - 1971) walking into a wind-swept town (notice the 
   unusual camera angles and POV shots) and placing a makeshift grave 
   marker in the middle of Main Street that reads &quot;Sam Hawkins 
   Died: November 13th 1881&quot;. A member of Hawkins' gang tells Sam 
   (Victoriano Gazzarra; <B><A HREF="today_we_kill_tomorrow_we_die_1968.htm">TODAY
    WE KILL, TOMORROW WE DIE!</A></B> - 1968) about the grave marker 
   (today is November 13th, a Sunday, not a Friday [I checked!]) and 
   about the stranger standing in the middle of the street, so he goes 
   outside and tells Django that he doesn't know who he is fooling with, 
   he and his gang drawing-down on him. Django is quicker than all of 
   them, killing each member, as well as Sam, with a single bullet each, 
   Sam falling dead next to his grave marker (A brief, quickly edited 
   flashback shows us the crimes of each of Django's targets just before 
   he kills them). Django has other grave markers he intends to use, 
   because he has a plan of vengeance. Why? Read on...</FONT></FONT><BR>

   while Major Rod Murdok (Paolo Gozlino; <B><A HREF="his_name_was_holy_ghost_1972.htm">HIS
    NAME WAS HOLY GHOST</A></B> - 1972) and his brother Luke (Luciano

   who is going to be the winner when the dynamite explodes (The tension 
   is palpable, as the two men throw it back to each other for more than 
   a minute. When it explodes, the loser has sense enough to back away 
   from it at a safe distance.). Rod notices Django in the crowd and he 
   looks worried, but when he looks into the crowd again, Django is no 
   longer there. We then see Django going to the local undertaker, 
   asking him how much it will cost to make a grave marker. &quot;One 
   dollar&quot; he says, asking Django the date and name he wants on the 
   marker. &quot;Today's date&quot; says Django, handing him a dollar 
   bill and saying the name &quot;Howard Ross&quot;. &quot;I'll do it 
   for free, in that case&quot; says the undertaker, handing Django back 
   the dollar bill. We then see Rod doing some business at Howard's 
   house, mentioning that he saw Django in the crowd at the party, as he 
   leaves. The panicked looks on Howard and his wife's faces tell us 
   that a visit from Django would be deadly. Sure enough, a short time 
   later, Django appears in Howard's home office, leading a frightened 
   Howard outside and then disappearing, as if he were a ghost. Howard 
   pleads his innocence, saying over and over, &quot;You're dead, 
   Django! You're dead! You're dead!&quot; Howard follows Django's voice 
   to a cemetery, pulls out a derringer and tries to shoot Django, but 
   he can't focus in on Django, because he seems to be in three places

   freshly dug grave, a grave marker with his name and today's date on 
   it adorning the head of the grave.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Rod hears of Howard's death, he gives his head henchman, Brett 
   (Carlo Gaddi; <B><A HREF="#KillPokerPlayer1972">KILL THE POKER PLAYER</A></B> 
   - 1972), $5,000 and tells him to hire twenty gunman to protect him 
   from Django, because he knows it is only a matter of time before 
   Django pays him a deadly visit. Alida, who may be having an affair 
   with Rod, hears Rod mentioning Django's name, so she gets out of 
   Luke's bed and goes downstairs in her nightgown to talk to Rod. He 
   asks her why she is not in bed with Luke and she tells him that his 
   brother is crazy and she doesn't know why she married him. Rod tells 
   her that it is because she is a world-class tramp, but she interrupts 
   him, saying Rod promised her a large sum of cash if she married Luke 
   and she still hasn't received it. Neither one of them know that Luke 
   is listening to their conversation in the next room (and since Rossi 
   portrays Luke, you can be sure he will not handle this bit of 
   information like a normal man), but even he knows that revenge is a 
   dish better served cold. Rod hands Alida some cash, while Luke pops 
   some pills (something he will do often in this film).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Rod gives his accountant, William (Teodoro Corra; <B><A HREF="roy_colt_and_winchester_jack_1970.htm">ROY
    COLT &amp; WINCHESTER JACK</A></B> - 1970), $5,000 in cash to give 
   to Mrs. Ross to buy her dead husband's homestead, thinking she would 
   be eager to sell. Turns out she is not as eager to sell as Rod 
   thought, so Rod goes to the local whorehouse after visiting Mrs. 
   Ross, the cash in his pocket, and goes upstairs with the town's most 
   popular whore (Lucia Bomez; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#WantedRingo1970">RINGO,
    IT'S MASSACRE TIME</A></B> - 1970). Django is waiting for him in the 
   whore's room, taking half of the $5,000 and tearing it in half, 
   telling William he will personally deliver it to his boss tomorrow 
   morning and to make sure he tells Rod that he is coming. William 
   tells some of Rod's men, who are playing cards downstairs, that some 
   man stole his money, so they stop Django outside, forcing him to 
   gun-down all the men except for William, telling him what to say to 
   Rod: &quot;I'm coming.&quot; (William ask Django his name and he 
   says, &quot;The Devil...from Hell! You're lucky you'll never see me 
   again.&quot;). We then see Brett hiring Rowland (Thomas Rudy; <B><A HREF="adios_sabata_1970.htm">ADIOS,
    SABATA</A></B> - 1979) and his four man gang of gunslingers, telling 
   Rowland that he will pay $1,000 a head to kill Django and he will 
   meet them at Desert City tomorrow morning. When Django arrives at 
   Rod's house, he finds William dead in the front yard, tied to a 
   makeshift cross, like a Western version of Christ's crucifixion. 
   Django knows it is a trap, yet he goes into the house anyway, 
   seemingly knowing where everyone is hiding and dispatching them in 
   various ways (making Django look like he has supernatural powers, or 
   he is, indeed, a ghost. One of Rod's men runs into a machete that is 
   sticking out of the front door of the house and he just stands there, 
   impaled clean through by the large blade.). Django goes down to the 
   basement and finds Alida tied and gagged, but before he helps her, he 
   kills another man waiting to ambush him by shooting through a burlap 
   sack full of beans. Alida then rummages through all the dead men's 
   bodies (!), taking all their money and valuables, proving that all 
   she cares about is money. She tells Django that the Murdok brothers 
   are white trash, but did she look in the mirror?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Luke dragging a man behind a carriage, while he laughs 
   away like a madman. When he gets into Desert City, he looks at the 
   man's dead body and says, &quot;I reckon that has taught you some 
   manners!&quot; The townspeople, including the mayor, tell the sheriff 
   that no one feels safe walking the streets of Desert City, even in 
   the afternoon, because of the Murdok brothers and the men they have 
   on their payroll, who are making the town deadly and lawless. The 
   sheriff then tells Luke that he wants to know the name of the man he 
   just killed and that he's sick and tired of all the violence and it 
   stops now. While the townspeople cheer at what the sheriff just said, 
   Luke pulls out his pistol and shoots and kills the sheriff and some 
   random townspeople (!), saying, &quot;Fools! Fools! Run for your 
   lives!&quot;, while he continues to laugh like a madman (it is 
   possible that he is certifiably insane). Rod comes outside and after 
   seeing what his brother has just done, he punches Luke and knocks him 
   out. The next time we see Luke, Brett and some of Rod's other men are 
   restraining him to a chair, while Luke yells away uncontrollably. 
   Alida tells Rod that she knows how to calm down Luke (after 
   explaining to Rod how Django killed all his men back at his house, 
   but not telling him how she stole all their money), so Rod and his 
   men leave Alida alone with Luke (who, apparently, has a 
   &quot;condition&quot; that gives him fits of violence, as we never 
   learn how Alida calms him down, but I'm sure sex is involved).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Rowland and his men are about to ride to Desert City, they notice 
   that someone left bear traps on their land. They find a bear trap 
   that is covered in blood, but when they move in to take a closer 
   look, the bear trap explodes and Django suddenly appears in the 
   smoke. He guns down Rowland's men, but spares Rowland when he pleads 
   for his life and cowardly runs away. Rod then finds one of Django's 
   grave markers on his land, with his name on it and tomorrow's date. 
   Rod orders Brett to find and kill Django, Brett not knowing that his 
   hired help is either dead or running with their tail between their 
   legs. Brett walks into the saloon and hires everyone in there to find 
   and kill the man who made the grave marker, promising the person who 
   kills him will receive $5,000 in cash. Brett has no idea who Django 
   is and Django is sitting at a table in the saloon. Brett tries to 
   hire Django to look for himself (!), but Django says no, he has a 
   game to finish. When Brett realizes what the stranger just said (a 
   &quot;game&quot; usually involves two or more people and he was 
   sitting by himself), he returns to the saloon, but Django is no 
   longer there. A short time later, three of Rod's men return on 
   horseback, only they are all dead, each of them tied to a makeshift 
   cross. Rod begins to wonder what it will take to get Django off his 
   back, but he's not going to like the answer to that question and 
   neither is Luke. Alida asks Rod why Django wants to kill him and Luke 
   and the only thing Rod tells Alida is it will be better if she left 
   this town and never returned, but Alida says a contract is a contract 
   and she is staying put (proving that her life is less important than 
   the money she hopes to get).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rod then has a flashback, showing us why Django wants him and all 
   the others dead. It turns out Django, and all the others fought for 
   the South as Confederates in the same regiment during the Civil War. 
   The Murdoks and all the other dead people turned traitor and told the 
   Union Army where they were located and everyone in Django's regiment 
   were killed in a surprise attack, including Django, or so Rod 
   thought. It would be quite unacceptable for the Murdoks to reveal 
   that they were traitors in the Civil War, so to hide their past, 
   Django has to die. It turns out that Alida is reporting to Django 
   everything she hears, only Luke hears her talking to him and he gets 
   an idea. Django then appears in Rod's office, telling Rod that it 
   took thirteen years to find him (I did the math and he is three years 
   off. The Civil War ended in 1865, not 1868!) and now he is going to 
   die slowly, like the coward he is. Rod puts his hands over his face 
   and begins crying, but when he removes his hands from his face, 
   Django is no longer there (Remember, he told Rod he would 
   die...slowly). Luke tells Alida that he has a plan to stop Django, 
   Alida not knowing that Luke overheard her talking to Django.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Django then begins killing Rod's men in earnest, thinning the herd 
   until only the Murdok brothers are left. Think you know how it is 
   going to turn out? How can Django be in two or three places at the 
   same time? Is he human or is he a ghost? This film is like a 
   Spaghetti Western version of Clint Eastwood's <B><A HREF="high_plains_drifter_1973.htm">HIGH
    PLAINS DRIFTER</A></B>, only made four years earlier than that film 
   (I wonder if Eastwood saw this film before he made his film? 
   Hmmmmmm.), yet when Luke shoots Django, he bleeds. Is he flesh and 
   blood as Luke believes or is it a supernatural trick to bring 
   everyone's guard down?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   actually his real name), makes sure to keep the viewer off-balance, 
   not knowing if Django is real or some sort of vengeful spirit and, 
   like most good Gothic horror films, you'll be asking yourself that 
   very same question long after the film ends. The real answer is this: 
   Django is who you want him to be. Some people will think he's a ghost 
   and others will believe he's a flesh and blood human being, but there 
   is no wrong answer here, he is what you think he is, as the final 
   shot is ambiguous. There's a scene towards the end of the film where 
   an unarmed Django walks into a church, only to have Luke, who is 
   hiding up in the rafters, slip a noose around Django's neck and pulls 
   it taut until Django is hanging off the floor, telling him, &quot;Be 
   patient, it takes time to die!&quot;, while laughing like a maniac. 
   Django then cuts the rope with a knife he keeps hidden in his boot 
   and the look on Luke's face says more than mere words can ever 
   convey, as he falls to his death, landing in the pews (Which is why 
   Luciano Rossi is one of my favorite Italian genre actors, hell, my 
   favorite Italian actor, period!). Even Rod comes to the realization 
   that fate cannot be cheated, as his traitorous actions have 
   consequences. He faces off with Django, his dead body falling next to 
   his grave marker. Just like in Eastwood's film, Django's body just 
   disappears as he is walking down Main Street, leaving Desert City as 
   Alida calls out to him that she wants to join him. Is he a ghost or 
   does he just walk very fast? (Now I am certain that Eastwood saw this 
   film!). This is a great example of a Spaghetti Western with horror 
   overtones, which would be copied by Antonio Margheriti for his film <B><A HREF="and_god_said_to_cain_1970.htm">AND

   giving him the name &quot;Night Eagle&quot;. According to an old wise 
   man in a cave, &quot;Death rides by Tex's side&quot; and he is sworn 
   to do what is right for all mankind. The film begins with Tex and his 
   constant companion, Tiger Jack (Carlo Mucari; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BlackAngel1989">BLACK
    ANGEL</A></B> - 1989) discovering the remains of a good Indian 
   friend, who is tied to a wagon wheel and looks like he has been 
   mummified. Since Tex just saw him a few days before, he wonders how 
   he could be in such a condition. Tiger says, by the looks of the 
   tracks left behind, it was two white men in a wagon who did this, so 
   Tex follows the tracks to their camp and guns down the two men, not 
   because they killed his friend, but because they are selling whiskey 
   to the Navajo (The Native American's drug of choice). The next day, 
   Tex's good friend, Kit Carson (William Berger; <B><A HREF="#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B>

   seemingly disappearing into thin air. Tex and Tiger follow the tracks 
   of the wagon train and find it has been attacked, the weapons gone 
   and everyone dead. What is unusual is the condition of Ted Murphy's 
   body. He looks like he has been mummified, in the same condition as 
   his Indian friend, only there is a small Indian fetish next to Ted's 
   body. Tiger says the fetish doesn't look like any he has seen from 
   other Indian tribes he knows, but Tex aims to find out whom it 
   belongs to.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   who doesn't like the questions Tex is putting towards him. Bedford 
   and his men draw on Tex, Tiger and Kit, forcing them to kill all but 
   one of Bedford's men. Just as he is about to spill the beans to the 
   trio, an Indian at a window fires a blowgun dart into the man's arm, 
   making him instantly shrivel-up like a mummy. Tex, Tiger and Kit give 
   chase, but they lose the Indian when Tex almost dies in some 
   quicksand. Tiger says the Indian may be from Mexico, so the trio 
   cross the border and talk to old frenemy El Morisco (the late Peter 
   Berling; writer/star of <B><A HREF="three_musketeers_of_the_west_1973.htm">THE

   Indian fetish and El Morisco recognizes it as an ancient Aztec god 
   called Xiutecutli. When El Morisco takes a closer look at the fetish, 
   he notices that its mouth is hinged and when he opens the mouth, some 
   strange particles fall from it. He tells them not to touch it and 
   when he looks at the particles under a microscope, he come up with an 
   idea of what it is. He places a piece of the particle in his fish 
   tank and when a fish eats it, it shrivels up instantly. El Morisco 
   tells the trio that he believes the particles came from an ancient 
   volcanic region in the Sierra Encantada mountains, a dangerous area 
   where &quot;you'll roast by day and freeze by night&quot;, but why 
   does El Morisco's Indian servant, Kanas (Flavio Bucci; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B>

   Indian tries to kill Kanas, but fails, and he tells the trio what he 
   knows. An ancient Aztec cult hopes to unite all the Indian tribes in 
   Mexico to cross the border into America and wreck havoc on the white 
   man, but first they need lots of guns and explosives before they raid 
   the United States. Tex, Tiger and Kit must find a way to infiltrate 
   the cult, but first they have to deal with El Dorado (Aldo Sambrell; <B><A HREF="long_ride_from_hell_1968.htm">A

   a Mexican town, where Tiger is shot and Kit must put his favorite 
   horse out of its misery when El Dorado shoots it, but El Dorado

   Lord Of The Abyss, telling the god that they are close to obtaining 
   their goal. El Dorado enters the cavern and tells Quetzal that the 
   delivery of weapons is delayed, thanks to Tex Willer. Female cult 
   member Tulac (Isabel Russinova) then tells the Lord of The Abyss 
   (Riccardo Petrazzi; <B><A HREF="mannaja_a_man_called_blade_1977.htm">MANNAJA:

    spaghetti western/fantasy is missing a certain something that would 
   make it a good film, namely a coherent plot. The film is all over the 
   place and I don't mean the many locations. It is so erratic, it's 
   hard to keep track of what is going on. Maybe it is because it took 
   four people to write the screenplay: Director Duccio Tessari, 
   Gianfranco Clerici (<B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST</A></B> 
   - 1980), Marcello Coscia (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">THE
    SECRET OF DORIAN GRAY</A></B> - 1970) and Giorgio Bonelli, the 
   brother of artist Giuseppe Bonelli, who wrote the story this film is 
   based on. This is a case of too many writers spoiling the story. 
   While it has the look and feel of a spaghetti western, the fantasy 
   elements get in the way, reminding me of a western take of all those 
   Indiana Jones films, especially <B>TEMPLE OF DOOM</B>. Just like in 
   that film, this one tosses-in some gruesome special effects, such as 
   the man shot with the dart. His face shrivels up until his eyes pop 
   out of the sockets. While most of the film can be watched with the 
   entire family, you never know when something disgusting is about to 
   happen (it's sudden and without any warning), so if you have young 
   children, I don't recommend you let them watch. While there are many 
   shootouts and explosions, something we are prepared for in a 
   spaghetti western, there are also human sacrifices, various 
   impalements (by arrow and spear) and sliced throats, making this film 
   an uneven mix that is hard to swallow. And the film doesn't conclude, 
   it just merely ends with our heroes riding off into the sunset. It's 
   not a total write-off, though. There is beautiful location 
   cinematography (by Pietro Morbidelli, who usually works for Italian 
   TV. It's hard to believe that the entire movie was filmed in Italy!), 
   some good action and plenty of atmosphere, especially the Lord Of The 
   Abyss' cavernous ritual room, which is bathed in bright neon red (you 
   get hot just looking at it!). There's also a pretty good miniature 
   volcano explosion and the destruction it causes, making this an OK 
   film for the adventurous. Be aware that there is no nudity (there's 
   only one female role), heed my warnings and you may have a good time.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   after the Civil War, Captain Ned Carter (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B> 
   - 1976) returns to the Mexican town of Sonoma after three years of 
   war. Ned is about to marry Mary Belle Owens (Adriana Guiffre; <B><A HREF="great_silence_1968.htm">THE
    GREAT SILENCE</A></B> - 1968) and he has brought a bunch of friends 
   to Mexico to celebrate with him. While waiting for Mary Belle's 
   stagecoach to arrive, Ned's friends get rowdy and fight with some 
   Mexicans (they hate Mexicans). Ned breaks it up, telling his fiends 
   that they are not so innocent, naming off their crimes. We have 
   gambler Tim (Maurice Poli; Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="white_fang_1973.htm">WHITE
    FANG</A></B> - 1973), who cheats whenever possible; Preacher Bellman 
   (Enrico Marciani; <B><A HREF="#FightingFistJoe1973">THE FIGHTING FIST 
   OF SHANGHAI JOE</A></B> - 1973), who steals from the collection 
   plate, The Ross Brothers (Alessandro Perrella; <B><A HREF="viva_django_1971.htm">VIVA!

   have killed a few; Judge Stump (Fortunado Arena; <B><A HREF="blindman_1971.htm">BLINDMAN</A></B> 
   - 1971), who uses the law to break the law; and various other 
   despicable people, who would kill you if you looked at them funny. 
   Tim mentions that there are thirteen people sitting at this table and 
   that is an unlucky number. Preacher Bellman says that, in religion, 
   the thirteenth guest is a Judas, a traitor to his friends. Right 
   after he says that, Mary Belle's stagecoach arrives and they all go 
   to greet it, only to find that everyone has been murdered, including 
   Mary Belle, who was shot between the eyes. Ned carries her body into 
   the church and instead of performing a wedding, Preacher Bellman 
   performs a funeral. Ned then tells everyone that they can't leave 
   Sonoma, as he believes one of them is responsible for the stagecoach 
   massacre. But which one of them is a Judas, the thirteenth guest?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then find out that when Ned was to marry Mary Belle, her late 
   father was to will her husband a played-out silver mine, which Ned 
   was about to reopen, thinking that there is still plenty of silver in 
   it and giving all his friends legitimate jobs. Is it possible that 
   this has something to do with Mary Belle's murder? Local girl Emilia 
   (Maily Doria; <A HREF="they_called_him_trinity_1972.htm"><B>THEY

   stagecoach and he hid all the gold in the mine. He died without 
   telling anyone where he hid it. Emilia tells Bellman to not tell 
   anyone else this bit of information because, if he finds it, they can 
   split it 50/50. Meanwhile Ned and Tim discover that two of the dead 
   men on the stagecoach were not Postal Inspectors at all, they were 
   U.S. Government Agents. Why were they on the stagecoach? Judge Stump 
   finds a map in one of the dead agent's pockets, showing a shaft in 
   the mine no one knew that was there. Stump is then killed (we don't 
   see who did it), but Ned's friend, explosives expert Joe (Dino 
   Strano, as &quot;Dean Stratford&quot;; <B><A HREF="seven_devils_on_horseback_1975.htm">SEVEN
    DEVILS ON HORSEBACK</A></B> - 1975), takes the map to Bellman and 
   asks him if he can find this hidden shaft in the mine (Bellman is not 
   only a preacher, he also knows mines and caves very well). Bellman 
   says yes, it probably can't be seen because of a cave-in, so he will 
   have to use Joe's expertise with dynamite (Joe loves to blow up 
   trains) to open the shaft. Joe says he will do it, but tells Bellman 
   not to tell anyone.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ned's friend Jack (Giuseppe Bellucci) tells Ned that out of 13 
   people at the wedding table, four are now missing and one is dead. 
   Are those four missing people dead, too? We then discover that Emilia 
   is playing the men against each other because she wants the hidden 
   gold all to herself. She is not above tempting Preacher Bellman with 
   sex in order to get her hands on the map. When Bellman refuses her 
   offer, she poisons him and he dies on the spot, Emilia taking the 
   map. When Bellman doesn't show up at the mine at the appointed time, 
   Joe tells Tim he believes Bellman betrayed him (and yet he tells Tim 
   everything!). Suddenly, they are pinned down by gunfire. Joe is 
   wounded, but Tim gets away. The gunfire comes courtesy of Ned and 
   some of his other &quot;friends&quot; (he certainly has a lot of 
   them!) and they bring Joe back to town and torture him. He then 
   spills the beans about the treasure map and the hidden gold. Now 
   everyone knows about it, but why are people still being murdered? Is 
   it greed or is it another reason? Flashbacks shown throughout the 
   film fills in the blanks...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is more like a giallo film with western-style trappings than an 
   outright Spaghetti Western, as we must discover who is committing the 
   murders and their motive for doing it. There is no one in this film 
   that can be considered a hero or even an antihero, as everyone here 
   is so unlikable, even the women, we don't care who gets killed. This 
   is a major sin for a mystery. Since there is no one to root for, the 
   entire film seems anticlimactic. Director/co-screenwriter Giuseppi

    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1987), using his pseudonym &quot;Joseph 
   Warren&quot;, fails to make this film seem anything but a lesser 
   mystery flick with nothing much to offer the audience. Even the 
   shootouts and violence seem old hat, you've seen it done much better 
   than here. Even the final shootout in the mine, between Ned and Tim, 
   is unexceptional. The discovery of the Judas is not very surprising 
   at all since only two of the thirteen are still alive and we only see 
   the deaths of three people, the others simply mentioned in the 
   dialogue. Skip this one because it is a minor and uneventful foray in 
   the western thriller genre. The screenplay was co-written by Adriano 
   Belzoni, who penned the script to the much better giallo flick <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#YourViceLockedRoom">YOUR

    The film opens with Apache Indian chief Crazy Bull (Charles 
   Borromel; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Monster Hunter">MONSTER HUNTER</A></B> 
   - 1981) talking directly to the camera, telling the audience that 
   what we are about to see is the true history of the West (Don't you 
   believe it!) and introducing us to a young white baby he named 
   &quot;Shining Sky&quot; that his tribe has adopted. We then see how 
   the white baby came into his tribe's possession. A small group of 
   settlers are massacred (including a young boy and girl, who are shot 
   point blank) by a band of outlaws, led by a slimy, eyepatch-wearing 
   scumball (actor unknown, but familiar). They leave a pregnant settler 
   alive, kicking her repeatedly in the stomach and then tying her to a 
   wagon wheel (a Spaghetti Western trope), where the cyclops scumbag 
   tries to burn her eyes out with a flaming log (for shooting him in 
   the gut). Before he can do it, a band of Indians on horseback 
   appears, killing all the outlaws (one gets an arrow shot through his 
   neck) and saving the pregnant woman, whom they bring back to their 
   village. Chief White Bear (Jose Canalejas; <B><A HREF="companeros_1970.htm">COMPANEROS</A></B> 
   - 1970) wants to know why they brought her here, because &quot;a 
   white woman brings trouble&quot;, but she dies during childbirth and 
   White Bear adopts the baby, naming him &quot;Shining Sky&quot;, 
   because he was born with the sun. White Bear tells his squaw that 
   they have two sons now, but some members of the tribe do not like a 
   white baby living among them, but they will get use to it over time. 
   As the years pass, the blond-haired Shining Sky (Sebastian Harrison, 
   the son of Eurocult actor Richard Harrison [<B><A HREF="vengeance_1968.htm">VENGEANCE</A></B> 
   - 1968]; Sebastian also starred in Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SodomasGhost">SODOMA'S
    GHOST</A></B> - 1988) and his brother, Black Wolf (Ignacio Carreno; <B><A HREF="men_of_war_1994.htm">MEN
    OF WAR</A></B> - 1994) get along swimmingly, or as Crazy Bull says 
   in his narration, &quot;They are brothers in mind and spirit.&quot; 
   Now a young man, Shining Sky and his brother challenge each other to 
   see who gets to ride a wild black stallion first. This is a 
   good-natured challenge with no malice or anger between the two, 
   because they are best friends as well as brothers. Black Wolf wins 
   the challenge, yet he invites his brother to jump on the horse with 
   him as they ride away laughing. But there is something they aren't 
   willing to share: beautiful squaw Rising Star (Lola Forner; the 
   Jackie Chan comedy <B><A HREF="wheels_on_meals_1984.htm">WHEELS ON MEALS</A></B> 
   - 1984), whom they both have a romantic interest in (Yet when she 
   asks them who won the black stallion challenge, they point to each 
   other and say, &quot;He did!&quot;). Crazy Bull doesn't want Shining 
   Sky to forget he is a white man, telling him. &quot;Water bathes and 
   fire burns&quot; and there's nothing he can do about it, so be proud 
   that he's a white man, don't be ashamed of it (Black Wolf teases his 
   brother, telling him that all white men smell like sour milk, 
   including him, which upsets Shining Sky and leads to Crazy Bull 
   telling him to embrace his whiteness).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Shining Sky is skinny dipping in a lake, Rising Star steals 
   his bow and arrows, telling him to catch her if he can, a squaw 
   outfoxed and disarmed the &quot;White Warrior of the Apache 
   Nation&quot; (When Shining Sky steps out of the lake, we get a quick 
   look at his frank and beans!). He catches Rising Star, but when he 
   goes to kiss her, she turns away, telling him, &quot;Don't or it will 
   be forever.&quot; Shining Star then kisses her, knowing full well 
   that when he does, Rising Star will be his woman until the day he or 
   she dies (There's no such thing as divorce or marriage in the Apache 
   Nation, at least not in any terms the white man would understand). 
   Black Wolf catches his brother making out with a squaw he can't see 
   clearly, so he decides to play a joke on them, putting on war paint, 
   shooting an arrow next to their naked bodies and then war-chanting 
   while standing on a boulder. What was meant as a good-natured 
   practical joke doesn't go over too well with Shining Sky or Black 
   Wolf, especially when he discovers that his brother was making love 
   to Rising Sky, or as Crazy Bull says, &quot;But that day the bald 
   eagle was flying low, a bad omen.&quot; Black Wolf grabs his brother 
   by the shirt and calls him a &quot;pale-face dog&quot;, telling him 
   he will pay for this treachery.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Later on, while the two brothers are playing an Apache version of 
   polo, Black Wolf loses his cool, telling Shining Sky that he is no 
   longer his brother and threatens to kill him. The two begin swinging 
   their polo mallets at each other while on horseback, Black Wolf 
   breaking his brother's mallet and knocking him off his horse. When 
   the two brothers land on the ground, Black Wolf is impaled in the 
   stomach with the broken mallet and dies. Not only is Shining Sky 
   distressed, so is Rising Star and to make matters worse White Bear 
   banishes his adopted son from the village. Telling him to never 
   return because he is no different than any other &quot;wasiku&quot; 
   (white man) and the Great Spirit has abandoned the Apache Nation for 
   allowing a white man to be a member of the tribe. Will Shining Sky 
   ever be able to redeem himself in White Bear's eyes?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    White Bear cuts Shining Sky's hair with his knife so he looks like a 
   white man, telling him to go live with the white man in their 
   &quot;wooden tee pees&quot;. He also tells his son that he speaks the 
   white man's language badly, so he should remain silent, listen, learn 
   and only talk when he can speak like them, also saying that the only 
   white men who kill are those &quot;with the star on his chest.&quot; 
   He gives his son some white mans clothes and sends him on his way 
   (After giving him this advice: &quot;Never say you are Apache. The 
   wasiku believe they are gods. They despise men with skin different 
   than theirs. Never say you are Apache! The wolf becomes a dog only 
   when it is forced to live outside the forest. Remember, if they learn 
   you are Apache, they will kill you!&quot; Don't you hate long 
   goodbyes?). After Shining Sky and Rising Star say their goodbyes, 
   telling each other that their love is forever, Shining Star heads out 
   to the white man's world on foot, because Indian horses are not shoed 
   and it would be a dead giveaway you are an Indian if you rode into 
   town on a shoeless horse.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We are then in a nameless town, where Cribbens (Luciano Pigozzi, as 
   &quot;Alan Collins&quot;; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Tornado1983">TORNADO</A></B> 
   - 1983) is talking to the Sheriff (Emilio Linder; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SlugsTheMovie">SLUGS</A></B> 
   - 1987), telling him he has had it with Ryder because he's getting 
   more arrogant every day and if he keeps carrying on this way, he will 
   want nothing to do with him or his boss, the Colonel. The Sheriff 
   tells Cribbens that the &quot;peacemaking operation&quot; has only 
   just started and men like Ryder are necessary...for now.&nbsp; 
   Cribbens disagrees, telling the Sheriff that making peace with the 
   Indians takes kid gloves and friendship, but Ryder is capable of 
   neither, cutting off the scalps of Indians will bring nothing but 
   trouble. We also discover that this territory is about to become 
   officially part of the United States of America, the Sheriff telling 
   Cribbens that when this territory becomes part of the state of the 
   union, the Colonel is going to remember who his friends are, as well 
   as his enemies. The Sheriff calls Cribbens a &quot;traitor&quot; for 
   his views because Indians are nothing but &quot;bloodthirsty 
   savages&quot; (This little conversation sets up the remainder of the 
   film). We then see Shining Sky enter the town and he doesn't make a 
   good first impression, as he is nearly run over by a horse-drawn 
   cart. Shining Sky pretends to be mute, following his adopted father's 
   advice, so his speech doesn't give away that he was raised by 
   Indians. The Sheriff sees him walk into the saloon and he follows 
   him. He then arrests him for not paying for a drink (Unlike most 
   Indians in films in this genre, this is Shining Sky's first taste of 
   alcohol, which he spits out, not liking the taste of it). As he and 
   the Sheriff leave the saloon, they watch Bart Ryder (Charly Bravo; <B><A HREF="#PriceOfPower1969">THE
    PRICE OF POWER</A></B><A HREF="#PriceOfPower1969"> </A>- 1969) 
   breaking a horse belonging to Cribbens' stable, but doing it in a way 
   that will ruin the horse for life, never making it useful as a means 
   of transportation. Ryder wants to shoot and kill the horse, telling 
   Cribbens that this horse will never be able to be ridden, but 
   Cribbens won't let him, especially when pretty young Isabella (Cinzia 
   De Ponti; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE NEW 
   YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982), the Colonel's daughter, sets eyes on 
   Shining Sky and suggests to Cribbens to let him try to break the 
   horse. When Shining Sky gets on the horse, he proves Ryder wrong (uh, 
   oh!), the horse is indeed able to be ridden (He even gets the horse 
   to walk backwards!). The peanut gallery watching this tells Ryder 
   that this boy is making a fool out of him and now Shining Sky has 
   made his first enemy, mere minutes after stepping foot in town. 
   Cribbens is so impressed, he hires Shining Sky to work for him and it 
   is rather obvious that Isabella is smitten with the shirtless, silent 
   man-child, but it is also obvious that she is not a nice girl. A 
   nameless black employee (actor unknown) of Cribbens tells Shining Sky 
   that he knows he is an Indian, but not to worry, his lips are sealed. 
   Ryder then enters the stable and calls Shining Sky &quot;mute 
   boy&quot; and says he is mute because his mother was raped by the 
   Indians. When that doesn't get a rise out of Shining Sky, Ryder tries 
   to smear manure on his face, so Shining Sky puts up a fight, but 
   Ryder's lackeys restrain him while Ryder whips him senseless and then 
   rides him out of town, telling him to never come back (this is 
   becoming a routine with this boy!). Isabella finds him bloody and 
   bruised on the outskirts of town, but her female slave, Duena (Beni 
   Cardoso; <B><A HREF="throne_of_fire_1983.htm">THE THRONE OF FIRE</A></B> 
   - 1983), tells her he is bad news and to leave him be, which she 
   ignores, bringing his barely conscious body back to her place. She 
   tries to seduce him, but all he can think about is Rising Star. But 
   does he have the willpower to ignore Isabella's constant romantic and 
   sexual advances?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the Colonel (Alberto Farnese, as &quot;Albert 
   Farley&quot;; <B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">NO WAY OUT</A></B> - 
   1973) whipping up the townspeople in a frenzy with his hate speech 
   about the Indians, telling them they are nothing but savages that 
   shouldn't be allowed to set foot in town because all the residents 
   will be murdered while they sleep (Hate speech at it's finest, 
   reminding me of a certain person's speech about illegal aliens 
   entering the U.S.). The Colonel wants them to murder every Indian 
   that they see, so when this land becomes part of the good ol' U.S. of 
   A., it will be free of murderous scum (Could this be the film that 
   that certain person copied his illegal alien speech from? Hmmmm). 
   Shining Sky loses sight of who he is and the promises he made, 
   falling victim to Isabella's sexual advances, while Crazy Bull tells 
   us Rising Star is patiently waiting for him to return to her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Ryder and a posse of the Colonel's men massacring an 
   Indian family in their home, including children, but&nbsp; not before 
   Ryder rapes one of the women. Shining Sky finds one of the children 
   dead with a tomahawk planted in his skull and follows the blood 
   trail, discovering the massacred family (Remembering what his adopted 
   father told him, Shining Sky curses a crucifix hanging on the wall, 
   blaming religion for the massacre). When Isabella discovers Shining 
   Sky can talk, she screams and tells the Sheriff and Ryder that he 
   raped her (I told you she was trouble!). They hang him by his arms on 
   the branch of a tree and leave him there to be food for the vultures, 
   while he roasts in the blazing sun. Just when it looks like his life 
   is over, Crazy Bull appears and cuts him down. We then see that Ryder 
   and the posse are now in Rising Star's village, while Crazy Bull 
   nurses Shining Sky back to health, telling him to return back to his 
   village, not as a white man, but as an Indian. But will Shining Sky 
   make it back to his village before Rising Star falls victim to 
   Ryder's rapey ways? It wouldn't be a Bruno Mattei film if the heroine 
   didn't suffer some sexual violence, would it? With the help of a 
   young Indian named Geronimo (yes, that one!), Shining Sky gets his 
   revenge, cutting out one of Ryder's eyes, but the Colonel and Ryder 
   are not through with him yet, as we discover Rising Star is pregnant 
   with Shining Sky's baby!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is not a typical Bruno Mattei gore film. It is more like an 
   &quot;Indians good, white men bad&quot; Spaghetti Western flick 
   (Cribbens, the only good white man in this film, is run out of town 
   by the Colonel and Ryder). While the story and screenplay, by 
   producer Jose Maria Cunilles (producer/writer of Mattei's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellLivingDead1980">HELL
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1980) and Franco Prosperi 
   (director/writer of <B><A HREF="farewell_uncle_tom_1971.htm">FAREWELL 
   UNCLE TOM</A></B> - 1971 and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wild Beasts">WILD
    BEASTS</A></B> - 1984), may be lacking and full of stereotypes, the 
   film is gorgeous to look at (cinematography by Luigi Ciccarese; 
   Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Aenigma1987">AENIGMA</A></B> - 
   1987; Mattei's <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Cruel Jaws">CRUEL JAWS</A></B> 
   - 1994), full of beautiful vistas that look like fine art (this<A HREF="white_apache_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/white apache france dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="227" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   film must be seen in its original aspect ratio [OAR] to be fully 
   appreciated). While not a gore film per se, that is not to say that 
   it doesn't have its share of bloody deaths, including arrow 
   impalements, tomahawk whacks, death by throwing knife and plenty of 
   bloody bullet squibs. According to Sebastian, the majority of the 
   film was directed by Claudio Fragasso: &quot;Bruno Mattei only shot 
   one day on this film, as he was busy shooting <B><A HREF="scalps_1987.htm">SCALPS</A></B>.
    The scene he shot is when I get my arms broken by Charley Bravo's 
   character (<I>He misremembers. He never had his arms broken in this 
   film - Editor</I>).&nbsp; I remember how meticulous he was with the 
   camera angles as well as the lighting and how, naturally, it took 
   twice as long to set up shots.&nbsp; You could tell Bruno knew what 
   he was doing, as he didn't choose the same boring and safe set ups as 
   Claudio.&quot; The final third of the film details Shining Sky and 
   Rising Star's quest to keep a step ahead of Ryder and the posse, with 
   their new baby boy, who they name Black Wolf (awww, how nice!) and 
   failing miserably, as Rising Star is captured, beaten and raped, 
   Ryder trying to make her scream by bashing her head with the butt of 
   his rifle. Rather than screaming, Rising Star smiles, thinking about 
   all the good times she had with Shining Sky, which leads to her 
   death. Ryder empties his pistol into her back while Shining Sky 
   watches from above. Shining Sky then dies, but not before killing 
   Ryder by impaling him through the stomach with a spear. We then 
   discover that the baby Crazy Bull was holding in the beginning of the 
   film was not Shining Sky at all, it was Sky's baby Black Wolf. I 
   originally watched this film with no intention of reviewing it (Every 
   once in a while, I have a &quot;lazy&quot; night, where I sit back 
   and watch films just for the pure enjoyment), but after viewing it, I 
   found it to be review-worthy, if only for how the film opened, with 
   Crazy Bull talking directly to the camera and telling us that Indians 
   speak English in this film so we, the viewers, will understand what 
   they are saying! Genius! Recommended to all fans of Spaghetti 
   Westerns, especially ones off the beaten path.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (a literal translation of the review title) and also known as <B><A HREF="white_apache_1986.htm#ApacheKid">APACHE
