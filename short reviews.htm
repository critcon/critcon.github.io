    HOLOCAUST</A><A NAME="Robot Holocaust"></A> (1986) -</B> This is one 
   of director Tim Kincaid's slew of sci-fi/horror films (see review 
   above) he made during the mid-80's while taking a break from making 
   gay porn under the name &quot;Joe Gage&quot; (which he still does up 
   to this day). It's also his worst. Supposedly taking place in the 
   future (the Twin Towers are in the background, but how was he to 
   know?), a robot dictator controls the air of his human subjects. A 
   warrior named Neo (Norris Culf), along with a rag-tag band of 
   fighters (and a cheap C-3PO knock-off), are out to save a scientist 
   who can clean up the air and save mankind. Badly-staged fights, 
   stilted dialogue, monotonic acting, hand puppet snake monsters (with 
   buck teeth!) and a total of about three robots make up this film, 
   whick looks like it was filmed mainly in some industrial boiler room 
   and a garbage dump just outside New York City. Sprinkled with a 
   little nudity and some gore (again supplied by Ed French, who must 
   have owed Kincaid a very big favor), this film can be best described 
   as about as exciting as watching 80 minutes of static. Also starring

   Vanity production for director/producer/screenwriter/star Wes Olsen. 
   Olsen stars as private detective Brock Johnson, who is brought onto a 
   serial killing case by Police Chief Cooper (James Moore). It seems 
   that the Detroit Creeper (Dan Myers) has moved into town and is 
   beginning to kill teenage girls and young boys (by slitting their 
   throats). Political intrigue abounds as the Mayor (Dave Bowling) 
   would like to cover up the murders because he has a backdoor deal to 
   have a new university to be built in his town. He tries everything in 
   his arsenal to sabotage the Chief and Brock. Filled with terrible 
   acting, flubbed lines, a droning synthesizer score and too little 
   gore, this film belongs in the trash bin and not on the video bins. 
   Running at 90 minutes, this film is at least 30 minutes too long as 
   the film is padded with endless talking scenes which leads nowhere.

   equipment, who in voiceover narration tells us the story of Earth's 
   terrible history, from World War II to the &quot;Great War of 
   1986&quot;. We have to put up with over 20 minutes of various 
   archival footage of war atrocities and hippie music until we get to 
   the main plot. A secret agent (Robert Vaughn) in 1986 stumbles onto a 
   Nazi plot (&quot;The Fourth Reich&quot;) to clone the world's leaders 
   and replace them with the real ones. He teams up with a bunch of 
   women prisoners to foil the plot. Believe me, it's ridiculous as it

   turns white so Poe has her committed to an asylum run by the sinister

   called madness and asks Dr. Grimaldi if he can do some research at

   will believe him except for his friend Dr. Forrest (Thomas Drake) and

   The script (if you can call it that) is filled with all the typical 
   Fred Olen Ray modern material: Women taking their clothes off, women 
   taking showers, women swimming in pools with tiny bikinis. 
   Unfortunately, the murder mystery is a bust as anyone, including a

   rated PG-13, there's also no room for blood and gore, except for a 
   shot of an oozing body and people being deprived of oxygen. Don't 
   waste your time with this one unless you want to make 78 minutes last 
   a very loooong time. Also starring Melody Ryane and Eb Lottimer. All

    film, which is English subtitled, is totally unfunny and

   the humor will be lost on English-speaking viewers. A group of

   discuss the meaning of life with a blind, pretentious professor 
   (Jaroslav Dusek). Out of nowhere, a bunch of zombie woodsmen (You can

   contains one scene where after a couple make love and have a spat,

    knew if you sent this to me that I would be obligated to watch it. I 
   did. I hate you. Now, on with the review. This film is merely a 
   series of vignettes, as Jake (Dan Haggerty) comes from a midwestern 
   town to L.A. in hopes of making $65,000 to save his business back 
   home. He joins a repo company and begins taking the tough jobs that 
   no one else can seem to handle. He repo's cars, a helicopter and 
   helps one of the gang in entering a race called the &quot;Slam 
   Track&quot;. He also helps a woman named Jenny (Dana Bently) get her 
   purse back from a snatcher and they begin to have a relationship. 
   When Jake repo's a gangster's car, the tough guy threatens Jake and 
   Jenny and forces Jake to enter the Slam Track and win, otherwise he 
   will kill them both. Needless to say, everything turns out for the 
   best. I'm still amazed that Dan Haggerty is still considered an 
   actor. He's as stiff as a board and has the emotional range of an oak 
   tree, yet he has appeared in so many films (I just recently saw him 
   in <B><A HREF="bury_me_an_angel_1971.htm">BURY ME AN ANGEL</A></B> - 
   1971 and <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Night Wars">NIGHT WARS</A></B> 
   - 1987), not to mention his Grizzly Adams TV series character. I just 
   have to wonder what alternative universe he stepped off of to get 
   these jobs. This Joseph Merhi-directed film is filled with 
   unbelievable situations (Like: Why did Jake stop short of winning the 
   Slam Track? He let everyone down including all his teammates and 
   himself. What a selfish oaf! Yet, in the end, everyone still loves 
   him!), bad comedy and awkward action (some scenes look like they were 
   lifted from other films). This is an early PM Production film where 
   Merhi was just beginning to get his action chops, as he would later

    science fiction/horror writer S.P. Somtow (real name: Somtow 
   Sucharitkul) and it's a marginal comedy/horror film at it's best and 
   downright terrible at it's worst. Father O'Sullivan (Tim Sullivan), 
   who has lost his faith, leads a bunch of headache-inducing characters 
   on a bus trip down to Mexico for All Souls Day, the only day of the 
   year when the dead can freely walk the earth.&nbsp; On the bus are a 
   married couple who are into trancendental meditation, a cranky male 
   duo who never agree on anything and a former nun and her son, who 
   Father O'Sullivan had an affair with years earlier. Can you guess 
   whose son he is? The mish-mash of a story finds local Dr. Um-tzec 
   (played by Somtow), who likes to cut the hearts out of children while 
   lamenting on how he wishes he was a stock broker on Wall Street, 
   replacing Father O'Sullivan's heart with an evil one in hopes of 
   getting him to sacrifice his son. Along the way, everyone gets 
   trapped in the town and murdered in various bloody ways (courtesy of 
   John Carl Buechler and MMI). One man is decapitated as his head flies 
   through the air and lands in a basketball net. Another has his arm 
   ripped off and shoved down his mouth, the fingers protruding through 
   his neck. The acting is strictly amateur hour (various writers and 
   horror enthusiasts, including Forrest J. Ackerman, play corpses and 
   zombies), the pace is slower than a snail with hemmoroids and the 
   ending is just downright ridiculous (something about playing 
   basketball against the zombies to save the kid's soul). Somtow

   insomniac to sleep. Fear no more. Here it is! Originally saddled with 
   the title <B>GOLDEN APPLES OF THE SUN</B> (what the fuck?), this 
   snoozer tells the story of businessman Richard (Percy Harkness) 
   taking uptight secretary Janet (Elizabeth Suzuki) out for a weekend 
   in the woods. For nearly a hour they fish, go skinny dipping, frolic 
   naked between the trees and make love while talking about the meaning 
   of life and the violence that comes with it. Janet complains when 
   Richard kills fish and shoots a rabbit, but has no problem stripping 
   naked and making love to the guy while he smears the rabbit's blood 
   all over her!. Things turn a little sour when Vietnam vets Jarvis 
   (Leon Morenzie) and Troubadour (Derek Lamb) show up and tell Richard 
   that they are staying in their cabin. Later that night Richard takes 
   a shot at them and they retaliate by tying up Richard in a giant 
   chicken coop while Jarvis rapes Janet in front of Richard (&quot;No! 
   No! No!......No!&quot;) while Troubadour plays a song on his guitar. 
   Janet begins to like it and the film ends with Janet saying goodbye 
   to Jarvis and Troubadour as she walks back to Richard to untie him. 
   Turns out that Richard was the worst of the bunch. The End. Knowing 
   that they had a stinker on their hands, New World Pictures retitled 
   the film for video release and advertised it as an 
   &quot;Action/Thriller&quot;. It's neither, just a&nbsp; four

   80's who picked up this thing thinking that it was in the vein of <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST

   flick with full frontal nudity and nothing else to recommend for it.

   put them through college. When Dean Grail found out that his daughter 
   was one of the models, he killed her and now is killing anyone who 
   poses for the photographer or gets in his way. This is below generic

   the word &quot;craptacular&quot; than this piece of SOV shit. After a 
   bad auto accident, which kills his entire family, Abel (John Gigante) 
   tries to protect the ghost of his family, including the title brother 
   (Jon Hammer), who was horribly burnt in the accident, from outsiders 
   using their now-deserted family home (which supposedly contains a lot 
   of hidden money) for make-out sessions by horny teenagers and nosey 
   rednecks. Most of the time Abel fails and his brother ends up 
   stabbing and slashing the teens with knives and power saws. Abel's 
   brother kidnaps Abel's girlfriend (Mary Beth Pelshaw) and he rescues 
   her and explains his predicament. She has a hard time believing his 
   story, but eventually takes his word for it. Then a film company 
   comes to the house to make a low-budget horror film. Saying any more

   film. When a future descendant of Daninsky (the always good Jay

   boobs playing Elizabeth Bathory (she's still a looker after all these 
   years), way too little of Naschy (who speaks English phonetically),

   and one that combines both. Since this film runs a scant 82 minutes

   is the best you're going to get here. It's a shame because Naschy is 
   wasted, Richardson dies way too early in this film and the plot is 
   highly generic. Shot on high-definition video by <A HREF="gary graver.htm">Gary
    Graver</A> (who never phones in a job), the film does have a 
   professional look and sheen, but it's just not enough. It's another 
   one of Ray's hack jobs whose only novelty is the appearance of 
   Naschy. His werewolf makeup is sub-par and the blood quotient is way 
   too low. The only question that I can come up with is: Why bring 
   Naschy over to the States if you are just going to waste him? It 
   holds little novelty as a horror film and less interest as a softcore 
   porn film. What a shame. Also starring Stephanie Bentley, Kennedy 
   Johnston, Jacy Andrews and Leland Jay. I still get a kick seeing Jay 
   Richardson hawking law firms in commercials on TV. It always brings a 
   smile to my face. Unlike this film. A Macabre Entertainment Release

   one of his late-80's futuristic thrillers where cloned warrior Dow 
   (David Carradine) searches for his wife (Brinke Stevens), kidnapped 
   by the Warlord (the always capable Sid Haig, who is also second unit 
   director here). Along the way Dow picks up upstart and wisecracking 
   female wasteland survivor Danny (Dawn Wildsmith) to help him in his 
   search. Dow also carries a mutant genetic head with arms in his 
   backpack, who gives him directions along with a little sass. Ross 
   Hagen plays Beaumont (who is probably having the most fun of anyone 
   in this film), who supplies the Warrior with guns and harem girls as 
   mutants with gas masks roam the countryside looking to stop Dow from 
   achieving his goal. He shouldn't have bothered. It seems his wife 
   wanted to leave Dow and likes being with the Warlord. Filmed with 
   lame action sequences (how many angles can you show a car tumbling 
   after an explosion?), dialogue that would make a child wince and 
   guest appearances by Ray stalwarts Robert Quarry, Michelle Bauer and 
   Fox Harris. This is a yawner of the first degree and if it wasn't for 
   the acting qualities of Dawn Wildsmith and Ross Hagen, I would have 
   turned it off long before it ended. I'm tired of these crappy 
   post-apocalyptic thrillers. Besides, the Italians did them best and 
   filled them with gore and extreme violence. What you get here are 
   half-baked action sequences, very little blood (Bullet hits with no 
   squibs? Sacrilegious!) and implied rape. Why bother? There are 
   pictures of helicopters on the video box but none appear in the film.

   are rank amateurs), but they are forced to endure embarassing 
   situations, badly-staged action fights (Stevie Wonder could stage a 
   better fight scene) and vampire attacks (they actually do bite 
   ankles!). The story involves a half-breed vampire killer Drexel 
   (Director and writer Adam Minarovich, doing his best Corey Feldman

   to rid the world of the tiny blood-sucking terrors (who travel in

   make their race superior to humans. They join forces with some normal 
   humans after the little vampires find and use the sword, using 
   Drexel's blood as a weapon in the finale to dispatch the vertically 
   challenged. To try and describe how bad this film is would be like 
   describing the color orange to a blind person (Do I have Stevie 
   Wonder on my brain, or what!). There's not one good thing about this 
   film, from the photography (probably shot on DV, with sped-up and

   residents of a small town by killing them with a crossbow while 
   waiting patiently on rooftops of houses. Grace (Rajskub) drives to an

   the serial killer. When she gets to the house, she only finds two 
   other co-workers there: Lauren (Melanie Lynskey) and Gina (Sheeri

   rash of crossbow killings, the last to take place just a few miles a 
   way from the house. Grace, who is the new girl in the company and no 
   one really know her, is at first a little reluctant to open up to the 
   two girls. When it appears that the killer is on their roof, the

   hoping to get some exclusive photos of celebrities for her rag, she 
   and a bunch of party guests become trapped in Ludwig's mansion while 
   someone wearing a red cape and mask begins killing them, sometimes 
   using devices from Poe's stories. Frank Stallone (Sly's more talented 
   brother) stars as Duke, who, along with bitchy, has-been star Alaina 
   (Brenda Vaccaro), vain starlet Colette (Christine Lunde), Rebecca's 
   ex-lover Max (Simon Poland) and various other boobs try to figure out 
   who among them is doing the killings. A waiter has his hand chopped 
   off. Alaini is choked to death and thrown down some stairs. Another 
   has her head cut off by a swinging pendulum clock. Max is repeatedly 
   stabbed and axed to death. Duke is run through after having a 
   swordfight with the red-dressed killer. As we find out that Ludwig is 
   dying from some incurable disease, the final denouement is really 
   unbelievable (something about taking some red pills to give the 
   killer super strength). Rebecca and the killer are the only ones left 
   and a fight ensues where the killer is impaled on a falling iron 
   grate that bars the front door. This is really boring stuff that 
   doesn't make much sense. There's a little blood, a really bad rock 
   band and endless shots of people running around the mansion. The only

    full-length movie. What we get here is a by-the-numbers horror flick 
   about a group of college students spending a night at an abandoned 
   hospital only to find that something supernatural lives there. Yawn! 
   The group is expecting some pre-set scares from some fraternity 
   brother who was sent their earlier in the morning to set up some 
   things that go bump in the night. He is dispatched rather quickly 
   (only our group thinks he's alive, not aware that the supernatural 
   presence takes over the dead bodies), and the group wonder why the 
   elevator only takes them to the third floor. Meanwhile, on the 
   outside, a cop who used to be a blaxploitation star named Dynamite 
   Jones (Dig Wayne) tries to help a friend whose sister is trapped in 
   the hospital. Little do they know that she is dead and taken over by 
   a good supernatural force, who must defeat the bad ghostly dude so 
   someone can live and tell the tale. Besides a couple of good special 
   effects and a ghostly little girl (which has been done to death in 
   Asian horror films), this film has little to offer that you haven't 
   seen a million times before. There's a blurb on the back of the DVD 
   by director Stuart Gordon that says: &quot;Enough scares for three 
   movies.&quot; Gordon didn't mention that those three movies must have 
   been comedies. If you like haunted house films, you may find 
   something here to get your heart pumping a little faster. I just 
   expected a lot more since Ferrante has worked on so many horror films 
   in his past, both behind and in front of the camera. Too bad. Also 
   starring Trish Coren, M. Steven Felty, Jilon Ghai, Nicole Rayburn, 
   Josh Holt and Dee Wallace Stone in a cameo. A Ventura Entertainment

    one is the most boring and worst of the lot. A young woman named 
   Yvonne (Cathey Paine) finds Barbara (Cheryl Waters), a friend she 
   hasn't seen in a while and resembles Yvonne almost to a tee, murders 
   her and takes over her life. Yvonne/Barbara then spends the rest of 
   the film trying to cover her tracks and not get caught. She is dogged 
   by Barbara's friend Maureen (Penne Hackforth-Jones), a friend of the 
   dead Barbara who worked in television news with her and tries to 
   convince the police and her producer (Barry Creyton) that the new 
   Barbara is not who she says she is. Yvonne covers her tracks pretty 
   well, as she is able to access Barbara's account at the bank and 
   convince some relative that she is actually Barbara. She even has 
   Barbara's blind boyfriend Carl (Tony Bonner) convinced. But Maureen 
   is steadfast and eventually convinces the police that Barbara isn't 
   Barbara after finding some incriminating evidence. In the most 
   interesting scene in the film, the police come and take Yvonne away 
   while she and Carl are having dinner in a restaurant. The only 
   problem is that Carl is in the bathroom when the police cart her 
   away. When he comes out of the bathroom and sits down at the table, 
   he continues a conversation not realizing that she is no longer 
   there. After a couple of minutes he discovers that she is gone and 
   calls out, &quot;Barbara! Barbara?&quot; THE END. Apparently, the 
   Australians could turn out some shitty TV movies in the 70's, just 
   like we did. Director Kevin Dobson (not the actor that played 
   detective Bobby Crocker on the original 70's TV series <B><A HREF="kojak_70s_tv_series.htm">KOJAK</A></B>),
    who also directed <B>GONE TO GROUND</B> and <B>DEMOLITION</B> is 
   still directing today, offers nothing in the way of entertainment and 
   this film is probably the best cure for insomnia in quite a while. 
   There's no blood, sex or believable storyline. In other words, a 
   typically bad 70's TV movie that, thankfully, only runs 82 minutes. 
   For Paragon completists only (especially for the 13 minutes of 
   previews at the beginning of the tape that's 10 times more 
   interesting than the film itself). Also starring Barry Pierce and

   miserably. Carol, a commercial actress, walks off the set of her 
   latest shoot where she is raped by wealthy businessman Mr. Lee.<B> </B>At
    the rape trial, Mr. Lee is found innocent and Carol vows revenge. 
   Wendy, a newspaper reporter, stays on the story when Carol is found 
   dead after unsucessfully trying to stab Mr. Lee. Wendy is attacked 
   and raped by four drunken hoods (When she puts up resistance, one of 
   the hood says: &quot;Why don't we go to a whorehouse 
   instead?&quot;!!!). Wendy does not go to the police because she saw 
   the way they treated Carol. Instead, she exacts revenge vigilante 
   style. Her fiance leaves her and takes up with another woman when she 
   tells him about the rape. She kills the four thugs by various means 
   (meat hooks, impalement on spikes and scares another hood by putting 
   her last victim's eyeballs in his bowl of rice!) and finds out that 
   Mr. Lee was also instrumental in commissioning her rape. As the 
   police close in, Wendy is caught stabbing Mr. Lee to death. At her 
   trial, Wendy gets imprisoned for life. That's the basic story, but 
   you'll have to put up with some footage that definitely comes from 
   different sources to pad out the film. Godfrey Ho (with help from 
   producer Joseph Lai) made many of these faux films during the 80's,

    who sports bad facial makeup and a white Eva Gabor wig to go along 
   with the lizard claw, goes on a killing spree murdering everyone who 
   he comes across. A teenage girl has nightmares about the monster 
   (called a Hungan) killing her and her boyfriend in the woods. So what 
   does this smart girl do? Why, she goes on a camping trip with her 
   boyfriend, her preteen brother and some high school friends. Needless 
   to say, almost everyone dies by the Hungan's lizard claw. Filled with 
   lame-ass acting (it's basically non-acting) especially by the 
   nightmare girl (BJ Moyer) who screams at every moment even when she 
   isn't being chased by the monster (you'll breathe a sigh of relief 
   when she's finally killed), cheap-ass gore effects (an awful 
   beheading, a guy's arm being torn off like it was made of butter, a 
   security guard getting repeatedly bashed on his head with a fire 
   estinguisher, bad lizard claw slashings), a monster that flails his 
   arms while chasing his prey, and a really bad rock band called Cry 
   Wolf who play their &quot;hits&quot; at a house party, this film 
   doesn't even cross over to the &quot;so bad it's good&quot; category, 
   even when a Pee Wee Herman imitator crashes the house party (WTF?!). 
   You'll just sit there slack-jawed with boredom hearing such lines as: 
   &quot;I've done it! I've done it! I made the dead live!&quot; and 
   watching endless scenes of teens talking to each other without saying 
   anything of substance. The best part of the film is the bloopers 
   shown before the end credits. The DVD from Troma is a VHS port as 
   there are instances of rolling and tracking problems. The picture is 
   very muddy. It was encoded in Dolby Digital though. Why?Also starring

    Matt Steinauer made a short film and stretched it out to an 
   unreasonable 75 minutes. It takes it cues from films like <B><A HREF="reservoir_dogs_1991.htm">RESERVOIR
    DOGS</A></B> (1992), Hong Kong action films, <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">THE

   (1979) and countless other cult films and mixes them all together. 
   Instead of resulting in a good indie effort, it falls flat on its 
   face. In 1997, hitman Lens Ozark (David Wilson) is hired to retrieve 
   an ancient Chinese coin that will give the owner the rights to Hong 
   Kong (don't ask me how). He is doublecrossed after getting the coin 
   and murdered in the desert. He goes to Hell and meets Satan who also 
   loses the coin (it has a mind of its own) forcing Ozark to come back 
   to the desert during a nuclear test, which makes him invincible. He 
   sets out to get revenge on mob boss Vincenzo Malachi (Vince Di 
   Meglio, the best thing about this film), taking out all his henchmen 
   in a series of bloody and (supposedly) comic viginettes. The bullets 
   fly fast and furious as Ozark shoots his way through the cast, is 
   rescued by a girl (Stephanie Matthews-Diaz) who has a connection to 
   the coin, and hopes for a happy ending. The only problem is that 
   Steinauer tries to dazzle us with overused camera tricks (solarized 
   shots, sped-up photography, bullet-eye view) and an ending that can 
   best be described as unfinished. I had high hopes for the film, but 
   was disappointed almost immediately after putting the DVD in my 
   player. It just tries to be too hip for its own good. It's all flash 
   and no substance. A little restraint would have went a long way. Also 
   starring Elliott Grey, Ken Wilson, Manny Fernandez and Bill Hill.

   This totally misogynistic horror film is famous for two things: It is 
   an early work from art house director Alan Rudolph (credited as 
   &quot;Gerald Cormier&quot; on some prints, although Gerald Cormier is 
   a real person and not a pseudonym [He actually Produced the film]) 
   and contains a devil-may-care performance by Andrew Prine. <A HREF="barn_of_the_naked_dead_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/barn of the naked dead vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Both
    have said that they wish this film was better left forgotten. While 
   I agree, others absolutely love this film. I'm still baffled why. The 
   story begins with three female singers (Manuella Theiss, Sherry 
   Alberoni and Gyl Roland) having car trouble on their way to Las 
   Vegas. They become stuck in the desert and are rescued by Andre 
   (Prine). Andre turns out to be a psychopathic freak and chains up the 
   girls in his barn, along with a half dozen other girls that are 
   already there. He whips the girls in order to get them to follow his 
   orders (&quot;You all belong to me now, you know.&quot;). This 
   delusional freak is making them perform in his own private circus. 
   Andre also keeps a mountain lion as a pet and sets it loose whenever 
   a girl tries to escape. Also running around in the desert is a 
   mutated radioactive man who lives in a shack near the barn and kills 
   any nosey people who stray near the area. This mutant turns out to be 
   Andre's father, who got too near a nuclear test years earlier. That's 
   about all the story there is. The rest of the film is mainly scenes 
   of Andre whipping the female cast while spewing bile, making the 
   girls perform circus tricks, killing them when they don't obey and a 
   small subplot of the three girls' agent searching the area for them. 
   Unfortunately there are no instances of nudity, living or dead, only 
   a very bad film with a real downbeat ending. Alan Rudolph took over 
   directing this film after the original director couldn't hack it and 
   Andrew Prine has said in interviews that he even directed parts of it 
   because he wouldn't get paid unless the film was finished. Rudolph 
   would go on to direct the weird <B><A HREF="endangered_species_1982.htm">ENDANGERED

   What you are left with is a very bloody film (lots of body parts, 
   throat slashings and stabbings) with a highly disposable cast of 
   no-talents and a plot that could fit on a cocktail napkin. The worst

    boring South African production about the murders of white 
   prostitutes by some unknown Black assailant using an ancient African 
   spiked weapon. The town medical examiner (Joe Stewardson, who looks 
   like Jack Elam on a three week bender), who is dealing with some 
   personal and professional problems of his own (including talking to 
   people who aren't really there and having prophetic dreams), tries to 
   solve the series of killings while dealing with racial tensions and a 
   crooked government. More soap opera than horror, this film tries to 
   stuff too many ideas into the plot and alienates the audience in the

   enough for me to justify this as a rental or impulse buy to anyone.

   sounds whenever a scene of blood is about to be shown and the 
   &quot;Hooter Honk&quot; which sounds whenever scenes of nudity are 
   about to be displayed. What's the story behind this whole mess do you 
   ask? It's a story about five high school girls (who look old enough 
   to have graduated college) who get even with every male that has 
   abused them and other women in their town.&nbsp; They go around 
   shooting, stabbing, chopping, running over and chainsawing their 
   prey. All the violence is played broadly and not very convincingly 
   (most of it is never shown) and the nudity, while nice, seems to go 
   against the story's grain (especially when they talk about who has 
   the biggest tits), thereby making it gratuitous. The acting is 
   uniformly awful as the actors mug for the cameras and a lot of them 
   look like they are reading off cue cards. This is really rough going 
   for even the most patient film viewer. Carmine Capobianco, who 
   co-wrote this mess with Bechard and starred in many of Bechard's

    Gorman Bechard does seem to have a cult following, but this film 
   seems to play a joke on his fans as he pulls away at nearly every 
   turn when he's about to show violence and nudity. He's playing you 
   for the sucker. There's even a scene set in a video store where the 
   girls praise <B>PSYCHOS IN LOVE</B> and even hold up the VHS box for 
   everyone to see and another in an agent's office where a poster for <B>DISCONNECTED</B>

   All the other characters from the original are in this, except 
   instead of Hal Holbrook as the priest holding the secret it is now 
   Kenneth Walsh as the town's mayor.&nbsp; A few minor updates 
   involving the use of computers and a video camera are added to 
   modernize the story, but screenwriter Cooper Layne basically just 
   lets all other aspects of his screenplay mimic the original. While I 
   consider the original film to be lesser Carpenter, at least it was 
   steeped in atmosphere as the fog was a character all in itself. This 
   remake has most of the fog CGI-created, making it look hokey, not 
   scarey. The remake's idea of scares consists of turning up the volume 
   of the soundtrack and hope you jump. It doesn't. It's just annoying 
   and will have you reaching for the volume control on a regular basis. 
   The ghostly denizens of the phantom ship are also poorly rendered. 
   Spend your hard-earned money on something more worthy. Like a good 
   back-waxing (you know you need it). The DVD is the Unrated version

    SILENCE</A><A NAME="Dead Silence 2006"></A> (2006) -</B> Taken out 
   of their natural habitat (on stage or in comedy clubs), ventriloquist 
   dummies are fucking scary. This movie tries to play on that fear. A 
   husband and wife receive a dummy at their door that seems to have a 
   life of it's own. While the husband is out getting Chinese food, the 
   wife is brutally slaughtered, her face sliced up to look like a dummy 
   and her tongue cut out. A local detective (a really horrendous Donnie 
   Walhberg) thinks the husband, Jamie (Ryan Kwanten of <B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE

    (his name is Billy) belonged to the late ventriloquist Mary Shaw 
   (Judith Roberts), who was killed years ago in the town of Ravens Fair 
   after being accused in the disappearance of local children. Jamie 
   goes to Ravens Fair (which, as luck would have it, is his home town) 
   and begins unraveling the mystery of Mary Shaw and her 101 dolls, who 
   all got buried in separate graves surrounding Mary. Why would someone 
   dig up Billy and send it to the married couple? It all has to do with 
   Jamie's father (Bob Gunton), who was one of the men who killed Mary 
   years earlier. Mary has returned for revenge and she has dug up all 
   101 of her children to help her get it. That's all you need to know 
   about this slow-moving flick, directed by James Wan (the <B><A HREF="saw_2004.htm">SAW</A></B> 
   franchise). Besides a couple of decent jump scares courtesy of creepy 
   Billy and his moving eyes and jaw, this is a pretty tedious affair 
   and an ugly film to look at. The film is purposely drained of most of 
   it's color and given a sickly blue glow, so everyone looks jaunticed 
   or dead. It's done to set a mood, but it becomes a severe distraction 
   after the first 30 minutes. I can't begin to describe how utterly 
   awful Donnie Wahlberg's performance is here. His bullying portrayal 
   as a no-nonsense cop is so devoid of any emotional depth, you'll 
   swear he's more wooden than the dummies. It also doesn't help that 
   the film doesn't make a lick of sense (Why start the killings now? 
   Wouldn't it have been more prudent to kill those responsible for your 
   death much earlier than this?). I think director Wan and scripter 
   Leigh Whannell were looking to create a new horror franchise, but 
   since this died a very quick death in theaters, I think this is the 
   last we will see Mary Shaw and her huge tongue (Did I forget to 
   mention that? Every time she cuts out someone's tongue, her's get 
   longer!). <B><A HREF="dead_silence_2006b.htm">D</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="dead_silence_2006b.htm">EAD

   - 1983; <B><A HREF="#Cemetery High">CEMETERY HIGH</A></B> - 1988) 
   ultra-low-budget horror comedy which spends too much time winking at 
   the audience and not enough time developing a plot (Where the hell 
   are the cops?). The characters break the fourth wall often, as Joe 
   and Kate speak directly to the screen, the camera and boom mike 
   become conscious parts of the plot and even the special effects crew 
   are seen pumping stage blood during one murder sequence. The violence 
   is graphic (effects by Jennifer Aspinal), but hard to take seriously 
   since Joe and Kate wink at the screen so often. The film is also full 
   of nudity, bit it's also used for comical effect. There's also a 
   sub-plot about a plumber (Frank Stewart), who is also a cannibalistic 
   serial killer and works his way through the cast until there's the 
   eventual showdown between him and Joe and Kate. I know this film has 
   it's fans, but I'm not one of them. I've always found Bechard's films 
   a little too forced and jokey for my tastes and frequent star Carmine 
   Capobianco (who also composed the crappy original songs) to be an odd 
   choice for a leading man. His pudgy build, full beard and thinning 
   hair, added to his total lack of acting talent, makes a pretty 
   pathetic impression on the screen. Try watching this and Bechard's <B><A HREF="galactic_gigolo_1987.htm">GALATIC

   equivilent of a full frontal lobotomy. The only saving grace is 
   Bechard regular Debi Thibeault, who is not only beautiful, she also 
   has a modicum of talent. It's too bad she couldn't have escaped 
   Bechard's gravitational pull and appeared in more mainstream fare

   primer on how not to film an action scene. The stunts are poor, the

   embarassing is a young Robert Patrick (<B><A HREF="terminator_2_judgement_day_1991.htm">TERMINATOR

   snake-like thingy that follows Lucinda around). Most of the chainsaw 
   attacks are computer-generated effects (they are so obvious, it's 
   criminal [and the chainsaw blades never spin!]) and what physical 
   effects there are belong in a high school play (especially Bambi's 
   possession makeup). Toss in cheerleaders that are at least fifteen 
   years too old, a script that doesn't make a lick of sense, dialogue 
   that only retards would speak (After witnessing Dawn chainsawing the 
   mute servant of the witch in half, one of the cheerleaders says,

   of&quot; a post-apocalyptic film where a tribe of cannibal Amazons 
   battle a bunch of male mutants, showing us in repetitive (and boring) 
   detail how every gory effect is achieved. Every now and then, the 
   &quot;documentary&quot; stops dead in it's tracks to show us the 
   antics of the film's deformed gofer, Fang (Paul Saunders, who sports 
   one fang, like a vampire that tried to put the bite on a piece of 
   petrified wood), who disrupts the film's shoot at the most inopportune<A HREF="splatter_the_architects_of_fear_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/splatter architects of fear vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   times, not to mention biting the heads off live rats every now and 
   then. The question quickly becomes: Why in the hell would a film 
   company employ this retard? (On a side note: Why would Fang let 
   himself be forced to eat out of a dog dish on the floor while the 
   rest of the cast and crew have lunch at a table right next to him?) 
   That's the whole film in a nutshell. Needless to say, if the film 
   this fake documentary is documenting was ever actually made and 
   released, it would probably be ten times more entertaining than <B><A HREF="splatter_architects_of_fear_1986c.htm">SPLATTER</A></B>,
    but that's not saying much. Ten times zero still equals zero.&nbsp; 
   This Canadian production, directed by Peter Rowe (who directed lots 
   of episodic Canadian TV, as well as making several real 
   documentaries), may have been mildly diverting back when it was made 
   (when there was still some mystery in how special effects makeup was 
   done), but today it just seems dated. All the behind-the-scenes stuff 
   seems endless, as the film's premise is this: Show a short clip 
   (usually less than two minutes) of the &quot;real&quot; movie and 
   then spend the next ten minutes or so detailing how every gore shot 
   in that clip was achieved, followed by a short scene of Fang 
   misbehaving in some way, like interfering with a shot or babbling to 
   himself like some deranged mental patient doing an imitation of Peter 
   Lorre. I'm at a loss for words describing how simply awful Paul 
   Saunders is as Fang and I also have a hard time understanding why 
   Rowe found it necessary to include this character into his film. For 
   a film about special makeup effects, Fang's makeup is especially 
   sub-par, drawing attention to the bad prosthetic over his left eye 
   and his blatantly fake dental appliance. On the plus side, there's 
   plenty of female nudity (apparently, Amazon women of the future have 
   trouble keeping their tops on) and bloody gore, but the repetitive 
   nature of the final product and the obvious non-acting talents of 
   everyone in the cast (who try to make all the behind-the-scenes 
   footage seem ad-libbed, but they all look rehearsed and forced), not 
   to mention Fang, makes this 77 minute faux documentary a true chore 
   to sit through. This was one of those films that every video store I 
   frequented during the 80's &amp; 90's had a copy of, but it never 
   seemed to leave the shelves. There's a reason for that. Also starring 
   Amber Wendleborg, Patti Aldrich, Doug Cawker and dozens of other 
   people you never heard of. There's a reason for that, too. 
   Surprisingly, Paul Saunders seems to be the only person in the cast 
   that made a career in the acting profession. Originally available on

   remake!&quot; when hearing about director Zack Snyder's retelling of <B><A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_2004.htm">DAWN
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> (2004) and then finding that you actually found

   Romero's <B><A HREF="day_of_the_dead.htm">DAY OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
   (1985) as Richard Simmons does with heterosexuality. Made in late 
   2006, but released directly to DVD in 2008 (not a good sign), this 
   &quot;reimagining&quot; of Romero's classic (my favorite of his six 
   [so far] <B>DEAD</B> films) finds the town of Leadville, Colorado 
   being quarantined by the military, led by Captain Rhodes (Ving 
   Rhames, who starred in the <B>DAWN</B> remake, but only has an 
   extended cameo here), after the townspeople come down with a <A HREF="day_of_the_dead_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/day of the dead 2007 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>mysterious
    &quot;flu&quot;, which leads to death and then instant reanimation 
   as flesh-hungry zombies. As luck would have it (in what turns out to 
   be a long line of handy coincidences), one of the National Guard 
   members, Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari; <B><A HREF="stuck_2007.htm">STUCK</A></B> 
   - 2007), was a citizen of Leadville before she left to join the 
   Guard. When she disobeys a direct order and checks up on her sick 
   mother and brother Trevor (Michael Welsh), Sarah, along with her 
   brother, Dr. Logan (Matt Rippy), Trevor's girlfriend Nina (AnnaLynne 
   McCord) and fellow soldiers Bud (Stark Sands) and Salazar (a terrible 
   Nick Cannon), must fight a town full of screaming, fast-moving 
   zombies (who now also sport such ridiculous powers like being able to 
   jump unrealistic heights and the ability to walk on walls and 
   ceilings!) while trying to avoid being bitten and infected. Trevor 
   and Nina are trapped inside a radio station with overweight, 
   pot-smoking DJ Paul (Ian McNeice; <B><A HREF="freeze_frame_2004.htm">FREEZE
    FRAME</A></B> - 2004), while Sarah and the rest must fight their way 
   out of a hospital, which is surrounded by zombies. When Sarah finally 
   reunites with her brother, they find a secret underground base and 
   discover that the government was using the citizens of Leadville to 
   test out their latest biological weapon. In a finale stolen directly 
   from John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AssaultPrecinct1376">ASSAULT

   zombies in a huge fireball and get out of Dodge as quickly as 
   possible.&nbsp; My, oh my, where do I begin in describing how truly 
   insulting this film is to the George Romero zombie mythos? While I 
   have no problem with the zombies being quick-moving (the <B>DAWN</B> 
   remake proved it could be effectively scary), director Steve Miner (<B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_part_2_1981.htm">FRIDAY

    PLACID</A></B> - 1999), working with a screenplay by Jeffrey 
   Reddick, found it necessary to give the zombies gravity-defying 
   powers that are so stupid, it made me cringe in embarrassment. About 
   the only zombie mythos still adhered to is death by head trauma 
   (Don't get me started that the zombies instantly explode when exposed 
   to fire!). The most embarrassing aspect of this entire film is when 
   Bud (a painful tip of the hat to the original <B>DAY</B>'s lead 
   zombie Bub, played by Sherman Howard) is bitten and turns into a 
   zombie; he refuses to bite anyone because he was a vegetarian when he 
   was alive! Give me a break! While the film is bloody as hell (in my 
   opinion, it goes well beyond it's R-rating), many of the effects are 
   obviously CGI-enhanced or totally computer-generated, giving many of 
   the effects a manufactured, fake feel. You never once experience the 
   effectiveness that practical effects would have achieved. This is a 
   pitiful excuse for a horror film, which is not helped by weak acting, 
   especially by Nick Cannon, who spits out more rap and hip-hop jargon 
   than ten Snoop Dog music videos. Don't waste your time. Watch the 
   original instead. Co-producer Boaz Davidson (director of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hospital Massacre">HOSPITAL

    DEADLY ART OF SURVIVAL</A><A NAME="DeadlyArtSurvival"></A> (1979) -</B> 
   Ultra-low-budget urban actioner that was shot on Super 8MM. Ghetto 
   resident Nathan (Nathan Ingram), a Bruce Lee-worshipping martial arts 
   teacher in his early-20's, is beaten to a pulp by a gang when he 
   wanders into the wrong part of the neighborhood. He vows revenge, so 
   he buys a gun (from a young boy in a church, no less!) and sets out 
   to get it. Nathan soon finds out that he was set-up and was supposed 
   to be killed instead of beaten-up. It seems local gangster Frankie 
   thought Nathan was fooling around with his oriental girlfriend and 
   got her pregnant when, in fact, it was actually gang leader Miguel 
   (who Frankie hired to kill Nathan) who was dipping his wick into 
   Frankie's chick. Nathan then gets into a disagreement with Harry, a 
   martial arts teacher from <A HREF="deadly_art_of_survival_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/deadly art of survival dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>a
    competing school who is also the local drug dealer. Harry has two of 
   his students (who dress as black ninjas) steal the tires off Nathan's 
   car (while he's in it making love to his girl!), steal Nathan's hat 
   and lunch (these ninjas are hardcore!) and then abduct his baby (He 
   has a baby?), leaving a headless doll in it's place and a note 
   telling Nathan that if he wants his baby back, he will have to fight 
   the ninjas to the death on the rooftop of an apartment building. 
   Nathan fights the two ninjas and gets his baby back, but he doesn't 
   kill the ninjas. Instead, he tears off his martial arts school's 
   patch from his jacket and gives it to the ninjas (huh?). Nathan then 
   goes mano-a-mano with Harry in a fight to the death, as Nathan 
   defeats Harry and drop-kicks him into the East River. The End.&nbsp; 
   This impossibly cheap home movie is a nice time capsule of the 
   late-70's Lower East Side in Manhattan but, as a film, it's severely 
   lacking in every department. Director/scripter Charlie Ahearn (who is 
   better known for directing <B><A HREF="wild_style_1983.htm">WILD STYLE</A></B> 
   [1983], which is considered to be the first film to deal with the 
   subject of hip-hop) uses local non-actor talent and there are many 
   flubbed and stepped-on lines (no second takes here). Ahearn also uses 
   live sound recording, where the background traffic noise and even the 
   sound to the camera's motor drown-out much of the dialogue. Add to 
   that editing that is so choppy, it's hard to tell where one scene 
   ends and another begins, truly awful hand-held camerawork that is 
   mostly pointed in the wrong direction or out-of-focus and some of the 
   worst-staged martial arts fight sequences this side of a Leo Fong 
   flick. The film's fragmented timeline makes it tough for the viewer 
   to keep track of what is going on and characters disappear before 
   their plot lines are finished, as if Ahearn was making this all up as 
   he went along or he simply couldn't get the local talent to appear in 
   another scene. The whole film has an unrehearsed, almost 
   documentary-like feel to it but, unfortunately, you'll be looking at 
   your watch more than the screen, wondering when this little obscurity 
   is finally going to end. The only bizarre scene is when a white drug 
   supplier is ranting to someone on his bed (we see everything from the 
   POV of the person on the bed), only to discover he is yelling at his 
   cat! Local NY underground filmmaker Beth B helped with the production 
   (she is also listed as one of the three camera operators) and appears 
   in a small role. The opening credits are spoken by star Nathan Ingram 
   and the closing credits are handwritten on a pane of glass. Also 
   starring George David Gonzalez, Miguel Villanueva, Gerry Hovagimyan, 
   Kiki Smith, Freddy Rivera, 'Sly' Arthur Abrams, Paula Humphrey, 
   Rosetta Campbell and Yoshiki Chuma (she is painfully embarrassing to 
   watch as Frankie's pregnant girlfriend). A Brink DVD Release. <B>Not Rated</B>,

   Maria is in a coma and is not talking. Maggie then teams-up with

    gang members, which leads to all sorts of trouble for the pair, 
   including street fights and car chases. It soon becomes apparent that 
   Maggie's stepfather, Jack (Tony Josephs), is responsible for Jeff's 
   death and wants Maggie and her mother dead, too. But why? When 
   someone dressed as a doctor enters Maria's hospital room and slits 
   her throat, it would seem that Jack is trying to get rid of all 
   evidence that points towards him. It turns out that good-old stepdad 
   needs Maggie out of the way (he was responsible for her prison stay, 
   too) so he can swipe money from her mother's bank account for a drug 
   deal that could net him millions. He keeps Maggie's mom in a constant 
   drugged-out stupor, while he tries to set-up Maggie for Maria and 
   Kevin's murders. As the police try to capture Maggie (in some really 
   bad chase sequences), she tries to find out the truth behind the 
   killings, blowing away bad guys and being deceived by best friend 
   Annalice (Michelle Bauer, appearing her as &quot;Michelle 
   McClelland&quot;). Maggie finally discovers the truth (after using a 
   flame-thrower on a bad guy), but will she be able to save her mother 
   before it's too late? Eh, I really don't care one way or the 
   other.&nbsp; This is an anemic 80's actioner that contains some of 
   the lamest, lazily staged action and fight sequences that I can 
   recall. It should come as no surprise that this was 
   directed/co-produced by David DeCoteau, the crown prince of lousy, 
   no-budget genre films (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dreamaniac">DREAMANIAC</A></B>

   - 2003). This is definitely one of the worst films of his early 
   career, an amalgam of tired action clich&eacute;s performed by a cast 
   of no-talents (not counting William Butler or Michelle Bauer, who 
   turn in the film's only decent performances). The film's main fault 
   is that lead actress Peggy Sanders is so stupefyingly awful and is so 
   skinny, even her nude scene made me cringe because I could count 
   every rib in her body (Eat something, girl!). When she ties a red 
   bandana around her forehead, dons an oversized pair of aviator 
   sunglasses and wields an extremely huge pistol (which she can barely 
   hold, nevermind aim), it elicits bouts of laughter rather than 
   thrills. She may be the very reason why DeCoteau (who is gay) gave 
   many of his later films a more homoerotic tone (lots of muscular 
   young guys with their shirts and pants off). <B><A HREF="lady_avenger_1988b.htm">LADY

   butler Harlan (Brannon Gould) and Dr. Blanchard (Joseph Haggerty), 
   who are all actually ageless flesh-eating ghouls that pay local hunk 
   bartender Markie (Joseph Commesso) rare German gold coins to supply 
   them with drunk bimbettes and fresh corpses to chow-down on. Both 
   June and Billy immediately sense something is wrong (June is the 
   spitting image of Maria De La Rosa, Von Brahm's servant, who had her 
   heart cut out by Von Brahm when she spurned his sexual advances) and 
   leave the mansion to stay in a hotel when the ghost of Von Brahm 
   attacks them, but Tammy stupidly stays behind when she gets the hots 
   for Harlan, who wants to turn her into a ghoul. To make an extremely 
   long, boring story short, June and Billy discover what Markie is 
   doing and Billy follows him to a coin store, where the coin dealer 
   (Scott St. James) gives Billy some vital information about Von Brahm 
   and the mansion. Meanwhile, June tries to stop Tammy from becoming a 
   ghoul and becomes possessed by Maria, who wants June to &quot;free my 
   soul&quot;. Markie tries to steal a chest of gold coins from the 
   mansion, only to become the latest meal for the ghouls. Now that the 
   ghouls no longer have anyone to supply them with fresh meat (a 
   boneheaded move on their part), they use Tammy (who now has tasted 
   fresh flesh) to lure June and Billy back to the mansion, but our 
   heroic duo brings a priest to the party to perform a s&eacute;ance to 
   save Tammy and Maria's souls and to perform an exorcism to rid the 
   mansion of Von Brahm's murderous spirit. June must find Maria's 
   still-beating heart and join it with her corpse to end Von Brahm and 
   the ghouls' reign of terror.&nbsp; This Grade Z horror flick is full 
   of cut-rate special effects (gore effects by director/producer Joe 
   Castro), including some terrible CGI work that looks like it was 
   created on a home computer. The acting is particularly amateur hour, 
   especially lead actress Perrine Moore (who even screams in monotone) 
   and Joseph Haggerty, whose idea of emoting is to scream every line 
   loudly, like he was in a noisy crowd. The only funny thing about this 
   film is how June, Billy and Tammy fail to notice that there is 
   something immediately wrong with the occupants of Von Brahm's 
   mansion, especially since the insides of all their mouths and the 
   spaces between their teeth are coated with a slimy black substance. 
   The illogical screenplay, by Daniel Benton, makes about as much sense 
   as putting lipstick on a pig (unless you're into that sort of thing, 
   you sick bastard!) and the dialogue is beyond comprehension. I love 
   the way Harlan says to Tammy, &quot;Why, why did you do this to me? I 
   loved you, now I'm going to kill you!&quot; and then Tammy just 
   simply rips his face off, killing him (a bad combination of CGI and 
   practical effects). There's not much I can recommend here, besides 
   some cheap gore, cheaper acting and even cheaper CGI (Easy on the 
   morphing effects next time, Joe). This isn't even bad enough to be 
   entertaining. It's just bad. Also starring Carol Rose Carver and

   Samurai swords to kill their prey and spoons to scoop-out the eyes!) 
   and our heroic quartet trying to save the prisoners. The entire film

   greasy, stringy hair. The entire production, including the gore and 
   zombie make-ups, is strictly bottom-of-the-barrel (even the guns used 
   here have CGI-created muzzle flashes because the paltry budget didn't 
   allow for blanks!) and should only be viewed by those wishing to 
   punish themselves for some past transgression they have committed. It

   the &quot;non-star&quot; cast, who are the real stars of the film 
   (Lamas is in this for about ten minutes and Barnes is in this for 
   five minutes, tops), is so maddenly crappy and unbelievable 
   (especially Phoebe Dollar as &quot;Phoebe&quot; and Christopher Irwin 
   as &quot;Captain Scott McCool&quot; [really?]) that I wanted to step 
   through the TV screen and give them acting advice, like how to 
   properly hold firearms and not to scream out every line they speak 
   (Yes, I know I'm not an actor, but I play one when watching shit like 
   this!). Lastly, the majority of the monster's screen time and about 
   50% of the makeup effects are achieved through CGI done so cheaply, 
   you can see the zipper on the computer. Really, they are that obvious 
   and shitty. None of this should come as any surprise once you 
   discover that the producer is David Sterling, a man who squeezes a 
   buck so tight, it turns into coins. Sterling also foisted such 
   cinematic turds as <B><A HREF="action.htm#Human Prey">HUMAN PREY</A></B>

   (2006), all starring Phoebe Dollar, so don't expect reviews from me. 
   There's not much to admire about <B>ALIEN 3000</B> (what the hell 
   does that title mean, anyway?), except for a few gory practical 
   makeup effects (including a disembowelment and a couple of 
   beheadings), a ridiculously cheesy monster outfit (it doesn't 
   resemble the monster on the DVD cover at all) and a hilariously funny 
   helicopter crash (an obviously radio-controlled model) that Lamas and 
   co-star Corbin Timbrook (the director of the much better <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Ranch">BLOOD

   so obvious that they are not sitting in a helicopter during this 
   sequence that it becomes painful and funny at the same time. Painful 
   for Lamas and Timbrook trying to pretend that they are and funny for 
   the viewer to watch them both fail miserably). In short, I've had 
   more fun discovering what I pick out of my belly button. Also

   word very lightly) that those cheap bastards at Maverick

   words, cheap shot-on-camcorder abominations that are made for black 
   audiences by unknown black filmmakers and then stocked at the local 
   supermarket for $4.99 a pop. Since they are shot on video (in this

   with bad ghosting effects whenever the camera moves quickly (and in

   Borders), who has a unique problem: Whenever he gets angry or 
   confused, something in his hand activates and someone ends up 
   brutally murdered. It has something to do with a top-secret 
   government experiment headed by Dr. James McDaniels (co-producer 
   Wesley L. Hubbard), who has implanted a device in Eric's hand that 
   makes him blackout and go on killing sprees. The local police are 
   baffled and are aided by an FBI agent to try and solve the murders, 
   while Eric and his white best friend, Webster (Robert Berson, who 
   talks more jive than a black street hustler) try to figure out why 
   Eric's hand throbs all the time. Eric also doesn't have the best 
   family life. His father was murdered a few years ago and his older 
   brother disappeared around the same time, so now he lives alone with 
   his tight-assed mother (Lynndi Scott), who, in one example of child 
   abuse, shuts off the electricity in Eric's room just as he's putting 
   the finishing touches on a school report on his computer and he loses 
   the whole report. Of course, his substitute teacher, Mr. Mendenhall 
   (Terrence P.N. Smith), rides Eric hard for not turning in his report 
   on time, so when a fight breaks out on the school's basketball court 
   and Mr. Mendenhall ends up shot dead and Webster is shot in the arm, 
   it looks like the bullets came from Eric's hand (shades of <B><A HREF="videodrome_1983.htm">VIDEODROME</A></B> 
   - 1983; actually, it's more like a faint shadow). The FBI agent is 
   aware of the device implanted in Eric's hand (the word 
   &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is bandied about quite freely throughout the 
   film) and he must find Eric before Black Ops agents sent by Dr. 
   McDaniels can grab him and make him disappear for good, just like his 
   brother years earlier.&nbsp; If I have made this film sound the least 
   bit interesting, I sincerely apologize. This is about as entertaining 
   as watching Aunt Sally's home movies of her trip to the spoon museum, 
   with the production values to match. Director/screenwriter/co-producer
    Wendell D, Hubbard (who, thankfully, hasn't made another 
   feature...yet) hasn't a clue how to pace a film (it's awkwardly 
   edited by co-producer Rene Besson) and since this is shot on video, 
   it's hard to hide the cheapness of the entire affair; from the 
   grainy, almost unwatchable, night scenes, moir&eacute; patterns 
   whenever light shines through a window and the repeated use of sounds 
   (such as canned, repetitive screams and gunshots) to cover-up lousy 
   edits. Movies like this aren't made, they escape, and Hubbard's lack 
   of talent shines through in every scene. Hubbard never explains what 
   the device in Eric's hand is supposed to accomplish (Is it a new 
   weapon to create a better soldier or some mad doctor's loony 
   experiment? Your guess is as good as mine.) and the absurd finale 
   (Was it all a dream? Is Mr. Mendenhall Eric's long-lost brother?) 
   only adds to the confusion. Skip this and take a nap instead. Also 
   starring Arthur L. Fuller (another co-producer), Mark Cooper, Sara

   It's a stab in the dark. During the Vietnam War, a platoon of

    WORKOUT</A></B> - 1986), to spill their guts about upcoming troop 
   movements. When no one will talk, the interrogator shoots one of the 
   soldiers in the head (offscreen) and American traitor Crawford (David 
   James Campbell; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EvilAltar">EVIL ALTAR</A></B> 
   - 1988) has a gook soldier beat Sgt. McKenna with a bamboo pole and 
   throw him in the &quot;Box&quot;. All the other American soldiers 
   know that, for some reason, McKenna is &quot;not right in the 
   head&quot; and begin in-fighting with Mitchell for continually 
   defending him. While in the box, McKenna has flashbacks to happier 
   times with his wife and child and Mitchell keeps talking to him 
   through the box to try and keep him sane. It doesn't work. McKenna 
   sinks deeper and deeper into madness (Flashbacks reveal that Crawford 
   may or may not be responsible for his wife's murder) and escapes from 
   the P.O.W. camp, but we then learn that this whole &quot;P.O.W.&quot; 
   experience was just a training exercise and that the camp is actually 
   on American soil. Too bad McKenna has gone totally bonkers and 
   believes he is still in Vietnam. He begins killing people he 
   perceives as the enemy and Crawford has no choice but to hunt him 
   down and kill him before more innocent people are killed and he has 
   to take responsibility for it all. Mitchell tries his hardest to find 
   McKenna and make him realize that the entire exercise is a fake, 
   while Crawford tries to cover his ass by tearing down the phony 
   P.O.W. camp and forming a posse using the American P.O.W. soldiers. 
   McKenna begins booby-trapping the American forest, putting the 
   soldiers', as well as tourists and bootleggers', lives at stake. Who 
   will stop him first: his friend Mitchell or the dastardly 
   Crawford?&nbsp; If film had an odor, <B>KILLZONE</B> would reek worse 
   than the hairy armpits of an Italian dock worker during the month of 
   August. It's not only badly acted by everyone involved (Ted Prior 
   would improve slightly as the years progressed), but the action set 
   pieces are so badly choreographed, a blind man could have done a 
   better job. Director/co-screenwriter David A. Prior has made many 
   stinkers in his career (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Night Wars">NIGHT

    IN THE WOODS</A><A NAME="EvilInTheWoods1986"></A> (1986) -</B> Proof 
   positive that any amateur production can get a home video release. 
   After a long opening credits sequence (where over 25 
   &quot;actors&quot; are listed), we are introduced to precocious 
   pre-teen Billy (who at one point has to stop dead in his tracks to 
   avoid walking directly into the camera!) as he goes into a library 
   and checks-out a book titled &quot;Evil In The Woods&quot;. After 
   being questioned about the Dewey Decimal System by the prim and 
   proper librarian (who wears a pair of oversized eyeglasses with red 
   frames), Billy is able to take the book home, but not after being 
   told by the librarian that the book is due back Friday...the 13th! 
   Billy takes to book to his bedroom, which is decorated with an Iron 
   Maiden poster (really?), lots of action figures (including C3PO, the 
   Frankenstein Monster and the Mummy) and something really angry 
   trapped in his closet that it is nearly rattling the door off its 
   hinges.

    milk and cookies and begins reading the book. The story takes place 
   &quot;Somewhere near Mildew, Georgia 1956&quot;, where a greaser is 
   attacked in his car by something unknown. The story then shifts to 
   the present, to nearby Atlanta, where a movie, &quot;Bigfoot Vs. The 
   Space Killers&quot;, is being filmed. Business executive Sam takes 
   his mistress Angel to the lake for the weekend of &quot;fun&quot; 
   (i.e. Sex. Should a little boy even be reading this story?). The cast 
   and crew of the film gather-up all their equipment and move the 
   production to a location in the middle of the woods, near the town of 
   Mildew (They pass the greaser's corpse and his car from way back in 
   1956, which brings up a whole lotta unanswered questions by the 
   audience, the main one being: Why hasn't anyone spotted this 
   before?). As The filmmakers try to get a shot in the can, where a man 
   in a shabby Bigfoot suit kills Sam and chases Angel, a little boy, 
   also named Billy, who is camping in the woods with his mother and 
   father, is kidnapped by the Pierson clan, a family of inbred 
   cannibals. The Sheriff of Mildew recommends that the parents contact 
   a witch named Ida if they want to get their son back, so he gives 
   them a map to her house which is also in the middle of the woods. Ida 
   serves the parents tea (out of a mason jar, the wine glasses of the 
   Deep South) and tells them to come back at dawn, unaware that little 
   Billy is in pieces in Ida's refrigerator! To make an extremely long 
   and boring story mercifully short, more and more members of the film 
   crew are captured by the Pierson clan (one of its members wears a 
   life jacket around his neck) and eaten or kept in cages, while Ida 
   hopes to kill the rest of the film crew using a magic spell, that 
   turns the cannibal clan into a bunch of paper mache monsters. And 
   what about Billy, the book and the thing in the closet? Let's just 
   say Billy has a surprise for his parents when they come home.&nbsp; 
   Awful, simply awful. One-shot wonder director/producer/screenwriter 
   William J. Oates hasn't got a clue on what makes a film watchable, as <B><A HREF="evil_in_the_woods_1986b.htm">EVIL

   [1969 - 1993]-style narration; title cards that serve no other 
   purpose than to hide the fact that director Oates forgot to shoot 
   footage to bridge scenes; acting that can best be described as 
   desperate; barebones sets (the same wood paneled wall is used for at 
   least three different sets); and makeup effects that are so low rent, 
   they make any early H.G. Lewis film look absolutely polished in 
   comparison. This film seems to have a cult following, probably due to 
   word-of-mouth (most likely from people with even less teeth than 
   brains), but I'm sure if those people actually saw the damned thing, 
   their opinions would change in a millisecond. The film screams 
   &quot;amateur hour&quot; and contains gay jokes, a splash of blood 
   and gore here and there, drug use, no nudity, 80's style big hair; 
   and professes to show what goes on behind the scenes of a low-budget 
   horror film, but I doubt Mr. Oates has ever been on the set of a film 
   before making this turd, and it shows. Boring with a capital PU.

   minimal locations (just a stretch of desert highway and the motel), 
   defies all common sense (When the girls escape from the 
   plastic-covered motel room, they quickly decide to return to kill 
   Jack, but their hesitation to do so once back in the room causes one 
   girl to get shot and another to get hit by a truck) and moves at a 
   pace that would try the patience of a snail. It also contains one big 
   blunder that wasn't caught in the editing stage: When Jack shoots the 
   tow truck driver on what is supposed to be a deserted stretch of 
   highway, we can distinctly see the reflection of the sun hitting the 
   windshield of a passing car (any editor would have to be blind to 
   miss it, which leads me to believe that they left it in hoping no one 
   would notice). While Jeff Denton and the female cast are fine in 
   their roles, they are woefully underwritten (Jack's reason for being 
   psychotic? His girlfriend cheated on him! Jesus, if every male 
   decided to turn serial killer because of this situation, there would 
   be no good men left!). The violence, though bloody, consists of a few 
   gunshots to the head and body and some stabbings. Nothing to write 
   home about. While there is some nudity on view, none of it is the 
   least bit titillating as most of it is prefaced by rape or death. Not 
   worth your time, especially after the stupid shock ending that plays 
   the audience for a fool. Also starring Alexandra Boylan, Erica Roby,

   (Wonder Russell), Starr (Bee Simonds) and Elliot go to the basement 
   to get more booze, but what they find instead is Guy's latest female 
   conquest slaughtered, with her breasts mangled and her entrails 
   laying on her lap like some spaghetti dinner. The ragtag group find 
   themselves trapped in the club, along with a bum (Damon Abdallah) who 
   slices Guy's face with a piece of glass. The question soon becomes: 
   Who is the killer, as any remaining member of The Choke, as welll as 
   Guy and the women, could be the murderer? London is a goth chick who 
   is obsessed with death; Nancy Boy is always threatening to kill 
   someone; Dylan is so self-obsessed it wouldn't surprise anyone if he 
   is dispatching everyone out of spite; and Guy owns the place, so why 
   doesn't he have the keys to unlock the doors? When Mike's body is 
   discovered tied to an amplifier with his heart drilled out and no one 
   has a cell phone with them (which I find hard to swallow, even in 
   2005), the group gets knocked-off one-by-one (using musical 
   instruments as weapons) until the killer is revealed. Speaking of the 
   killer's identity: Be pre-prepared to make sure any throwable object 
   is not within your reach, as you will surely want to toss something 
   at your TV screen once the killer is revealed (mainly in disgust). <B><A HREF="choke_2005.htm">THE
    CHOKE</A></B> (also known under the generic title <B><A HREF="axe_aka_the_choke_2005.htm">AXE</A></B> 
   [which actually has two meanings if you use one in the musical 
   sense]) is exactly what's wrong with most modern DTV horror. Director 
   Juan A. Mas (co-director of the equally lame horror flick <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Coroner">THE
    CORONER</A></B> - 1999) and screenwriters Jessica Dolan &amp; 
   Susannah Christine Lowber fill the film with self-referential and 
   sarcastic dialogue that no punk rocker would get caught dead 
   repeating. There are references to Shakespeare, dead kittens, the 
   fact that Dylan's girlfriend Jonesy is a virgin (Why the hell would 
   the vain Dylan have a virgin for a girlfriend, especially for two 
   years?) and not one bit of it works here. It all seems rather forced 
   and fake. Even Henry Rollins would have a problem spitting out this 
   dialogue. There are a few bloody killings, but most of the carnage is 
   shown after the fact. We never see Mike penetrated with the drill, 
   the spiked guitar strike on London as she tries to escape through a 
   crawlspace, Nancy Boy getting sliced with a sharpened cymbal and 
   finished off with a drumstick to his eye, Dylan impaled on a piece of 
   rebar, the bum getting whacked over-and-over with an axe or Guy 
   getting castrated. We only get to see the after-effects, including 
   Mike with his own balls stuffed in his mouth. It's all done rather 
   cheaply and unconvincingly. When the killer is unmasked, the 
   motivation for the killings comes totally out of left field, making 
   the viewer feel they have been cheated. What's the point of having a 
   killer target a specific group of people if the audience is not 
   allowed any clues or to sleuth along with the victims? In other 
   words, <B><A HREF="choke_2005c.htm">THE CHOKE</A></B> choked on its

   Darrin has seen enough weirdness and wants to leave, but then he 
   meets the male members of the Barley family, including retard Woody

   him for dinner. We are then introduced to divorced mother Donna 
   Parker (Eleni C. Krimitos) and her bratty daughter Tabitha (Jada 
   Kline), who stop in the title town for some gas and a bathroom break. 
   Sugar talks the bitchy Tabitha into ditching her mother and coming 
   home with her (to listen to Wayne Newton records!), while Donna has 
   to deal with an uncooperative Sheriff (who just happens to be Pa

   unusually large amount of missing persons posters on the Sheriff's 
   office wall). Donna refuses to leave town, so Sheriff Barley has his

   away) and town drunk Henry (Joe Estevez, who has made a career doing 
   cameos in low-budget crap like this) warns Donna about Sugar and the 
   rest of the Barley clan. Tabitha becomes friends with the stuttering 
   Woody (yes, he's retarded and stutters!), while Donna sneaks into the 
   Barley home looking for her daughter. Will mother and daughter be 
   reunited or will they both end up as missing persons posters on 
   Sheriff Barley's wall? Don't think too hard, otherwise your brain 
   might explode at all the inconsistencies this film has to offer

   editing and sound recording are particularly rote, changing from 
   scene-to-scene and the background noises drowning-out some of the 
   dialogue. There are so many other things wrong with this film, like 
   it is obvious that this &quot;small town&quot; in Texas is anything 
   but (check out the gas station scene for proof) and the fact that 
   Sheriff Barley is wearing a police uniform that has &quot;Los Angeles 
   County&quot; patches on the sleeves and no one seems to notice! It's 
   just sloppy filmmaking, plain and simple, with a total disregard to 
   the viewer's intelligence. To add insult to injury, the gore and 
   makeup effects are nearly nonexistent considering the subject matter 
   and besides the sliced throat in the beginning of the film, the 
   camera always pulls away just as the &quot;money shot&quot; is about 
   to be delivered. Why make a film about a cannibal clan and leave out 
   the cannibalism? The film tries a little too hard to be quirky and 
   funny, but it all comes across as forced because the cast is not up 
   to the task (some of the acting would make Ed Wood blush in 
   embarassment). Save your hard-earned rental bucks and avoid this film

    Bernard L. Kowalski-directed horror quickie</A> (starring the tragic 
   Yvette Vickers). I think Roger Ebert once pondered why we are 
   remaking popular films when there are so many bad, unknown films that 
   could use a good retelling. Well, Roger, here's the reason why. The 
   story opens with old coot Grundy Miller (Gary Peterson) walking 
   through the swamp and coming upon a camp of three girls in bikini 
   tops and short-shorts (one of the girls has a pronounced belly). The 
   film then stops dead in its tracks for a few minutes as we watch the

   each other (in super slow-motion) while Grundy spies on them and 
   salivates (Not once do the girls take their bikini tops off, so

   girls says, &quot;Did you hear something?&quot; and the big-bellied

    out of the swamp water and attaches itself to Grundy's crotch, but 
   he manages to free himself with a few well-placed shots with the butt 
   of his rifle. He runs to the home of Walter (Jody Haucke), a 
   restauranteur whom Grundy supplies illegal game for his menus, to 
   tell him about the giant leeches (and to show him the hole in the 
   crotch of his pants!), but Walter doesn't believe him and tells 
   Grundy to get back to the swanp and shoot him some menu items. Walter 
   has more serious problems. His ball-breaking wife, Mary (Shawna 
   McSheffrey), is cheating in him with nearly every man in town and she 
   flaunts it in Walter's face. When a local man is found bled dry with 
   large sucker marks all over his body, local game warden Scott (Mark 
   Courneyea, here using the name &quot;Mike Conway&quot;) and his 
   girlfriend, oceanographer Gracie (Kerri Draper), head out into the federally-protected
    swamplands and notice a lack of any animal life in the area (That is 
   when they are not arguing about their personal lives. I wanted to 
   punch both of them in the face.). They come upon the three female 
   campers and warn them to be careful (Nothing, and I mean nothing 
   happens during this entire sequence). Mary has an illicit interlude 
   with Ray (Ray Besharah) in the marsh and is caught red-handed by 
   Walter, who forces them at gunpoint to walk in the water, where Mary 
   and Ray are attacked by the giant leeches and dragged away. Walter 
   tries to explain to local cop Bucky (Kevin Preece) what happened, but 
   he doesn't believe him and leads a bunch of Canadian rednecks on a 
   search of the lake, which turns up nothing. As more people end up 
   dead or missing, Gracie's scientist father tries throwing explosives 
   into the lake to drive the leeches to the surface. When that doesn't 
   work, Scott and Gracie head to the leeches' nest, thanks to a homing 
   device planted in a cooler of blood. I don't know about you, but I'm 
   rooting for the leeches.&nbsp; They don't come much worse than this,

   dialogue scenes with no payoff. The leeches themselves are large 
   inanimate rubber concoctions pulled through the water on fishing line 
   (look closely and you can spot it) and when they attack (probably 
   with someone's hand and arm inside), it is obvious that the actors 
   struggle with them like they would if they were being attacked by a 
   stuffed animal or ventriloquist's dummy. The shot-on-digital video 
   look of the film is flat and lifeless and the less-than-professional 
   acting (with obvious Canadian accents, eh?) doesn't help the 
   proceedings, especially with the ridiculous dialogue they have to 
   spew (&quot;This is how a man handles things. Short and sweet!&quot;).

   plot in a nutshell: An over-the-hill former Air Force pilot is 
   pulled-off the front line (the war they are fighting is never 
   mentioned by name, but it is obvious to anyone but the most 
   incompetant that it has to do with the conflict between North and 
   South Korea) and ordered by his superiors to train four young hotshot 
   pilots the finer points of the art of war and flying jets into the 
   heart of enemy territory. The old coot (he's 52 years old!) doesn't 
   want to take the job (he would rather go back to the front lines!), 
   but he has no choice, so he makes life as hard as possible for the 
   four young'uns, denying them such basics as food, sleep and a social 
   life until they fall in line and learn to work together as a team. 
   Trouble ensues when one of the young pilots falls in love with the 
   old coot's sister (who is clearly half her brother's age, proving 
   that their mother would either make her husband use a condom or only 
   got in the &quot;mood&quot; twice in twenty-five years!), another 
   loses his will to fly and yet another has a sister who is in love 
   with an enemy official, the same guy who is responsible for their 
   father's death! When the old coot suffers a serious back injury by 
   parachuting out of a jet that is about to crash due to the stupidity 
   of one of his students, he is grounded permanently and becomes a 
   drunk (it doesn't last long). He makes his sister marry the hotshot 
   young pilot (over the phone!), just before the pilot is sent on a 
   mission and shot down behind enemy lines (surprise, surprise!). The 
   old coot defies orders and leads the other three pilots on a rescue 
   mission, saving the young pilot, but the old coot dies in the 
   process. He still manages to land the jet safely with his last dying 
   breath, though!&nbsp; This is a slow-moving, badly-dubbed film that 
   is more interested in soap opera than action. When the action finally 
   appears (around the 45-minute mark), it is clear that most of the jet 
   action is culled from stock footage of Korean jets in the air, 
   intercut with footage of the cast sitting in cockpits of jets that 
   are obviously not moving, never mind flying in the air! This is a 
   bloodless, nudity-free production that, quite frankly, screams out 
   for some of the patented Godfrey Ho/Joseph Lai newly-shot inserts 
   that would, in a year or two, become their trademarks and continue 
   onto the early-90's in such film as <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#MajesticThunderbolt">MAJESTIC

    TERMINATOR</A></B> (1986) and <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#GoldenNinjaWarrior">GOLDEN
    NINJA WARRIOR</A></B> (1986). The action here is limp and uneventful 
   (I get the feeling that, in its original form, this was a South 
   Korean propaganda film or an Air Force recruitment film), the love 
   story is boring (not to mention chaste) and the awful dubbing isn't 
   even good enough for a cheap laugh. Avoid it at all costs, although I 
   doubt you will ever find this film unless you specifically look for 
   it (and why would you?). Also starring Gerald Wing (c'mon now!), Anna

   come into play until the last ten minutes of the film? The film opens 
   with an all-male band, led by Nick (Matt Sbeglia, who is a terrible

   Bo Boddie [who also stars] and Sam Bisbee [also one of the

   can be heard singing on the radio during their road trip). Once they 
   get to the woods (where a &quot;Don't Go In The Woods&quot; sign can 
   be seen), Nick makes everyone give up all their cell phones, so <A HREF="dont_go_in_the_woods_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/don't go in the woods 2009 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>there
    are no distractions (Instead of just turning the phones off, he 
   chops them into pieces with an axe!). Little do they know that there 
   is a psycho all dressed in black (black trenchcoat, hat and mask 
   coveringing his face) and he is carrying a sledgehammer. The band is 
   an eclectic group, including an oriental and a blind guy and they all 
   get to sing, but when their girlfriends (and a French girl who can't 
   speak English) suddenly show up (they've been following the guys the 
   entire time), Nick gets a case of the &quot;fuck you's&quot; and 
   wants the girls gone the next morning so they can continue recording 
   new songs. When their car won't start (one of the girls is killed by 
   the psycho), they are forced to stay with the guys, which pisses-off 
   Nick even more. To make a long story short, it turns out Nick 
   actually hired the killer (or, alternately, Nick is actually the 
   killer, but that theory doesn't seem to hold water since people 
   actually see the psycho and Nick at the same time) and he wanted to 
   record the five new songs and kill the entire band and keep the songs 
   for himself. Now he also has to have the psycho kill all the girls. 
   He does just that and delivers the EP to a record executive (a cameo 
   by Eric Bosogian, probably as a favor to D'Onofrio since they both 
   starred on <B><A HREF="law_and_order_criminal_intent_tv_series_2001-2011.htm">LAW
    &amp; ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT</A></B>), who predicts the EP will be a 
   smash hit. The name of the EP? &quot;Don't Go In The Woods&quot;. 
   Give me a fucking break!&nbsp; The major problem is that everyone 
   speaks most of their dialogue in song and most of the songs sound 
   exactly alike (it's like alternative emo folk rock). We see the 
   psycho stalking the woods throughout the film, but most of the gore 
   doesn't come until the final ten minutes, where people are pounded in 
   the head with a sledgehammer (the poor French girl spurts blood from 
   her head like a water fountain), one band member has his musical 
   recorder embedded in his throat (every time he breathes, a note can 
   be heard playing), another band member has the front of his face 
   caved-in (a well-done effect), a bloody body in a sleeping bag is 
   seen hanging from a tree and the final girl has chunks of flesh 
   pulled from her back. The most ridiculous scene comes at the finale, 
   where Nick and the final girl are running from the killer and Nick 
   stops dead in his tracks to sing a song that he just thought up! (The 
   sequence seems to imply that Nick is actually the killer, as the 
   editing shows him clean, then bloody, then clean again, but it just 
   doesn't make any sense when compared to the rest of the film. It's 
   like D'Onofrio wants us to believe he's directing a horror version of <B><A HREF="fight_club_1999.htm">FIGHT
    CLUB</A></B> - 1999.). Nick ends up killing the (imaginary?) 
   mysterious psycho with his own sledgehammer and then watches the girl 
   slowly die. They don't come much worse than this. I hope D'Onofrio 
   learned his lesson and stays with acting, where his weird demeanor 
   fits the screen perfectly. It just doesn't fit as director of a 
   musical horror film. This is not a remake of director James Bryan's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DontGoWoods1981">DON'T

   outside to save her son, only to be attacked and killed by a dog (a 
   real one that wags its tail and looks about as harmless as a baby 
   holding a sledgehammer), the son having a bucket of blood thrown on 
   him with the wagging tail dog chasing him. We then meet pizza 
   delivery boy Wolf (Greg Hoople) and his best friend Jake (Adam 
   Schonberg), who have to make one more delivery way out in the woods 
   before they can go to the movies (Wouldn't Wolf have to return the 
   money to his pizza joint before he does anything else?). They reach 
   their destination, a cabin in the woods where an all-girl slumber 
   party is going on (What are the chances?), where Jake's sister Rachel 
   (Stephanie Motta) and Wolf's childhood crush Samantha (Nicole 
   Salisbury) are attending (What are the chances?). Lying that their 
   van has broken down, Wolf and Jake ask the girls if they can spend 
   the night (They say yes, because all girls are horny.) and Wolf takes 
   Samantha out to the van, where they make out and Wolf prematurely 
   ejaculates when Samantha tries to put a rubber on his dick. The next 
   morning, Wolf wakes up in the van and Samantha is gone, but she left 
   her phone behind with a message that she was picked up by someone 
   else and could he please return her phone. The girls inside the cabin 
   are attacked by a pack of bloodthirsty deer (really bad puppets) who 
   break through the balsa wood-thin walls and begin chowing down on the 
   females (You can actually imagine someone just off camera throwing 
   buckets of fake blood on the bodies). Wolf, Jake and Rachel take the 
   van and get out of Dodge, but Wolf wants to stop at Jake and Rachel's 
   house to pick up a charger for Samantha's phone (Rachel and Samantha 
   have the same model), since the phone died before he could get the 
   address where Samantha is. After almost being shot by his grandfather 
   for changing his shirt and rushing out the door (!), Wolf and the duo 
   head for Samantha, when a gorilla jumps on the van's roof (a terrible 
   CGI creation) and tries to rip out Rachel's throat before Wolf closes 
   the automatic window and cuts off the gorilla's hand (Which brings up 
   the questions: Where the hell did the gorilla come from? Can an 
   automatic window closing actually cut off a hand? Why would they have 
   the windows open in the first place?). They are forced to travel by 
   canoe, where they are attacked by a pack of bloodthirsty turtles 
   (really bad puppets and you can see the rods that control them) in 
   the water. They finally make it to Samantha, only for Wolf to 
   discover that she already has a boyfriend. They are all attacked by a 
   bear (another horrible CGI creation), killing Jake, Samantha and her 
   boyfriend before Rachel cuts its head off with a sword. Wolf and 
   Rachel decide to head east to Florida, but Wolf drives towards the 
   sunset. When Rachel reminds him that the sun sets in the west, Wolf 
   says &quot;Fuck it.&quot; THE END.&nbsp; All this badness lies 
   directly on the shoulders of director/writer/editor/co-producer Chris 
   Wojcik, this being his first full-length feature fim directorial 
   effort. If there is a God in Heaven, this will be his last, but since 
   I am an athiest, I wouldn't count on it. The entire film screams how 
   cheap it is, from the photography (by Jeremiah Franco, also a 
   co-producer), special effects (the gunshots sound like cap pistols), 
   common sense (Rachel gets out of the van at one point and decides to 
   walk home. This just after witnessing all her girlfriends being 
   slaughtered by the puppet deer.) and the music (by 
   &quot;Federal!State!Local!&quot;), especially the end credits song, 
   which sounds like it was recorded in someone's bathroom. The whole 
   film was meant to be a comedy, but the line readings by the entire 
   cast makes it sound like a third-rate vaudeville comic telling jokes 
   to a drunk, sparse audience. Do yourself a favor and get a 
   colonoscopy, because it will feel better than watching this film. 
   Believe me when I say this is one of the worst films I have ever had 
   the displeasure of viewing (and I have seen thousands). Also starring 
   Charles Bigelow, Phillip Musumeci, Katie LeVander and Melissa Orioli.

    MANIACS: FIELD OF SCREAMS</A><A NAME="a2001ManiacsScreams"></A> 
   (2010) -</B> What a steaming pile of shit. This film was shot in 12 
   days for $400,000, but it has the look and feel as if it was filmed 
   in one night on a drunken dare for $1.99. This sequel to director Tim 
   Sullivan's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Two Thou 1 Maniacs">2001 MANIACS</A></B> 
   (2004), which was also directed and co-written by Sullivan, doesn't 
   have one redeeming quality or an ounce of originality. Even Robert 
   Englund refused to return as deadly Mayor George W. Buckman; this 
   time replaced by Bill Moseley, who is beginning to appear on a lot of 
   crap lately. The story is simple: When the Southern sheriff of 
   Pleasant Valley refuses to cooperate with Buckman and his Confederate 
   Civil War era cannibalistic group (Which includes an Asian woman and 
   a black man. What the hell?), taking down the detour sign (spelled 
   &quot;Detore&quot;, which I guess is supposed to be funny because 
   Southerners can't spell) to lure Northerners to their deaths, Buckman 
   has the sheriff killed (the old nails in the rolling barrel gag, 
   which was missing from the first remake) and decides if the North 
   won't come to Pleasant Valley, they will come to the North. They all 
   hop on a bus and end up in Iowa (Is that even the North?) where a 
   reality show called &quot;Road Rascals&quot;, about two spoiled and 
   dumb Paris Hilton/Nicole Ritchie-wannabe sisters, is traveling in an 
   RV, when it hits the &quot;Detore&quot; sign, giving them two flat 
   tires. Only having one spare tire and no cell phone service (No cell 
   phone service in Iowa? C'mon now!), this aggravating group, which 
   includes the two snotty rich girls (one of them walks <A HREF="2001_maniacs_field_of_screams_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2001 maniacs field of screams dvd ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>around
    holding the taxidermied remains of her small dog), their boyfriends 
   (one of them is a closeted gay man), a lesbian European producer, a 
   Jewish director, an Hispanic driver and his black girlfriend (How's 
   that for diversity?), are met by Mayor Buckman, Granny Boone (Lin 
   Shaye, one of the few returning cast members from the first film) and 
   their clan. They hold their annual &quot;Guts 'N' Glory 
   Jamboree&quot;, where they slowly (and I mean slowly) beging 
   murdering and eating the cast and crew of the reality show. One girl 
   is strapped to a table and has a buzzsaw rip her in half from her 
   vagina to her head. The lesbian producer has her face ripped off by a 
   contraption in the Milk Maiden's (Christa Campbell, another returning 
   cast member) chastity belt. The black girl is hanged by the old 
   throwing tomatoes (instead of baseballs) at a bullseye gag, which 
   releases a trap door under her feet (Hey, hasn't this been done 
   before, but more effectively in director H.G. Lewis' original <B><A HREF="2000_maniacs_1964.htm">TWO
    THOUSAND MANIACS</A></B> - 1964?). The Hispanic guy is impaled on a 
   pitchfork, only to survive (he acts like it is only a minor flesh 
   wound) and end up decapitated when Buckman slams the bus' hood on his 
   head. Another guy is electrocuted until his eyes explode out of his 
   skull. And so one and so one. Truth be told, there is not one 
   original death in the film that we haven't seen done better a hundred 
   times before, but we have to put up with some of the worst cases of 
   humor (a lot of it racist) ever committed to film, including a 
   cringeworthy bit where Granny Boone leads her cannibal ladies in a 
   song and dance routine based on the film <B><A HREF="flashdance_1983.htm">FLASHDANCE</A></B> 
   (1983), substituting the song &quot;Maniac&quot; with one called 
   &quot;Cannibals&quot;, which leads to the question: How would 
   cannibalistic Civil War Southerners, who rise only one day a year, 
   know anything about <B><A HREF="flashdance_1983.htm">FLASHDANCE</A></B>?
    Everything about this film is below par, from the photography, 
   editing, music, performances (Bill Moseley is horrible [he sings a 
   song of his own composition over the end credits and says &quot;Suck 
   my Dixie&quot; after the credits end] and Lin Shaye looks 
   embarrassed, which she should be. The rest of the cast, including 
   returning actor Ryan Fleming as the gay Hucklebilly, who likes to 
   fuck his stuffed sheep, are annoying as hell and there is not one 
   victim that has any redeeming quality, so we don't care if they live 
   or die.) and especially the sound. The dialogue sounds like it was 
   entirely looped later in a studio, as it really doesn't match the 
   acoustics of the settings. The finale, where a pregnant Granny Boone 
   delivers a black baby (Clearly, they used a young black boy about two 
   years-old for the baby!), is about as funny as watching people jump 
   to their deaths from a burning building. Do yourself a favor and stay 
   away from this, but if your must watch it for masochistic reasons, 
   stay away from the R-Rated version and rent the Unrated Version, as 
   it doesn't cut away from the gory deaths, adds an entire cannibal 
   dinner scene not seen in the R-Rated version, extends other scenes 
   and offers more copious nudity (the only reason I stayed watching 
   till the end), adding over three minutes to the running time. Unlike 
   director Tim Sullivan's (<B><A HREF="driftwood_2006.htm">DRIFTWOOD</A></B>

   one of the 14 producers here, although the late David F. Friedman

   Taura after she dissolves Bantor's right hand by shoving it into an 
   acid crater. Taura is sentenced to seven years on a prison ship by 
   &quot;The Justice&quot; (John Carradine in a 30 second cameo), where

   about the whole story in a nutshell, but the awful borst-belt comedy, 
   badly choreographed fights and almost total lack of nudity (Taura 
   goes topless for a few seconds in two scenes, but that's it) do the 
   film in. Fred Olen Ray borrows a few props from other films, most 
   notably the head alien in <B><A HREF="return_of_the_aliens_deadly_spawn_1983.htm">THE
    DEADLY SPAWN</A></B> (1983; the producer of that film, Ted A. Bohus,

   was shot on the cheap and it's painful to watch. It's hard to believe 
   that people back in the day actually paid to see this in a theater, 
   not to mention renting it on VHS. It's that bad. Luckily, since I'm a 
   member of Amazon Prime, I didn't have to pay anything to watch it on

    has also invited her godbrother (is there such a thing?) Dave (Damon 
   Lipari) to go along with them because she just basically wanted to be 
   alone and suffer in silence. Jennifer becomes even more disappointed 
   when Dave brings along high-maintenance girlfriend Brooke (Stephanie 
   Honore, who really grates on your nerves) with him. Jennifer then 
   becomes even more disappointed when Maya's boyfriend Tommy (Texas 
   Battle; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WrongTurn2">WRONG TURN 2: DEAD END</A></B> 
   - 2007) shows up at the cabin later on. Meanwhile, the Sheriff of 
   Boggy Creek (Carl Savering) and his Deputy (Frederic Doss) are 
   investigating a series of brutal murders, where the men are torn 
   apart (the Deputy pukes his guts out every time he sees one of the 
   bodies) and the women end up missing. It's apparent to the audience 
   that a Bigfoot-like creature is responsible (it is shown within the 
   first five minutes of the film), but the Sheriff denies the creature 
   exists, even though the Deputy thinks the legend is true. After a 
   long stretch of film time devoted to Jennifer's disturbed behavior, a 
   shotgun-carrying neighbor named Casey (Cody Callahan), whose wife 
   disappeared a year earlier, and shots of boats motoring through the 
   bayou (the scenery is the best part of the film), the Boggy Creek 
   creature begins dispatching the cast. First to go is is Brooke, who 
   jacks Dave's truck when she thinks he is getting too close to 
   Jennifer. The creature downs a tree in the middle of the road and 
   carries Brooke away. The next to go is Tommy, who is torn in half 
   when the creature pins him to a tree (the film's bloodiest moment). 
   Dave is next when he goes to look for Tommy. The creature tears his 
   face off with his claws. Maya is then captured by the creature, 
   leaving Jennifer alone to run through the woods and try to make it to 
   the highway. Just as she is about to make it, a whole tribe of 
   creatures emerge from the forest and drag Jennifer away (The 
   creatures use the women as baby-making machines!). THE END. This

   one-note characters who react unrealistically and some of them, 
   including the Sheriff and the Deputy, disappear in mid-film, never to 
   be seen again. This is just sloppy writing (Jaynes co-wrote the 
   screenplay with Jennifer Minar, who was also the Associate Producer), 
   introducing characters and not knowing what to do with them. While 
   there is some bloody gore on view, it is nothing spectacular. The 
   only positive point this film has is some nice scenery (filmed in 
   Jefferson and Uncertain, Texas) of the bayou and the lush green 
   vegetation. There's no other reason to bother with this unremarkable, 
   boring DTV flick. Also featuring Sarah Jenazian, Cody Cal, Bryan

   would think with a title like that, the least you would get is 
   wall-to-wall gore or at least some extreme violence. I'm sorry to say 
   that this shot-on-digital video effort is amateur hour for the 
   complete 90-minute running time (counting the 9 minutes of opening

   his doctor (Caleb Emerson) and hops on a plane headed for NYC (still 
   in his hospital gown, but no one seems to notice). Once back in NYC, 
   Joe is thrown a party by his friends, where everyone gets drunk and 
   women doff their tops. Dennis, meanwhile, kills a homeless veteran 
   (musician Andrew W.K.), steals his clothes and puts on a mask made 
   out of the American flag. Dennis begins murdering nearly everyone he 
   runs into (but we are not shown the gory killings until after the 
   fact), working his way towards Joe. Dennis slits the throat of Joe's 
   father (Bob Socci, who insists that his son call him 
   &quot;Colonel&quot; rather than &quot;Dad&quot;) and then chases Joe 
   into an auto junk yard, where they get into a fight and Dennis drops 
   a car on Joe, his guts spilling onto his new white tee-shirt. THE 
   END. The horror elements of this film are minimal since one-man 
   wrecking crew James Balsamo seems more interested in throwing in as 
   many thrash metal songs on the soundtrack as he possibly can. As 
   Balsamo films New York buildings and scenery (probably without a 
   proper permit, since they all look to have been shot with a hidden 
   hand-held camera), a different thrash metal song BLARES on the 
   soundtrack during and between scenes, while the dialogue (probably 
   filmed with the cameras' built-in microphone) is so low, you can 
   barely make out what anyone is saying. While I am sure there are 
   plenty of fans of this type of music (to me, it all sounds like some

   guitars and drums blare without any discernable melody), Balsamo 
   seems to concentrate more on the music than he does what is happening 
   on screen. The slow-moving end credits list about thirty bands that 
   play during the film (about 90% that I never heard of or would never 
   want to hear from again) and you'll see Balsamo and his relatives' 
   names listed on the technical end more than any other last name. The 
   Iraq war scenes look like they were filmed at a local beach (most of 
   the film was lensed in Islip, NY), because sand in the desert looks 
   nothing like sand on a beach. I can see why Lloyd Kaufman makes a ten 
   second cameo as Dennis' father, because this was partially financed 
   by Troma Films (Kaufman probably chipped in $100), but it doesn't 
   explain why actress Lynn Lowry (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#I Drink Your Blood">I

    FIRMER</A></B> (1999) or <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FathersDay2011">FATHER'S
    DAY</A></B> (2011), but 99.9% of the time it turns out to be cheap, 
   substandard horror flicks like this one. The film opens in 1985 in a 
   city called Murderton (&quot;Population 5017 and dropping&quot;), 
   where teenagers Debbie Dickey (Rachel Castillo) and Carl Sandersberg 
   (Paul Rust) are sitting on a couch watching TV, while a reporter (a 
   cameo by Felissa Rose; <B><A HREF="sleepaway_camp_1983.htm">SLEEPAWAY CAMP</A></B> 
   - 1983) warns orientals that a serial killer is out to murder them (A 
   horrendous attempt at humor, but the whole film is just one awful 
   joke after another). Debbie is a virgin and will only allow Carl to 
   give her &quot;Eskimo kisses&quot; (where they rub noses together!), 
   but Carl wants to go further and have Debbie give him a blowjob. 
   Debbie is worried about pregnancy or an STD and Carl replies, 
   &quot;You can't get preggers from a blo-jo!&quot;. The doorbell rings 
   and no one is there. The phone then rings and circus music is playing 
   on the other end. Suddenly, Debbie is being chased by someone wearing 
   a clown costume and carrying an axe. Debbie runs out of the house, 
   with the clown not far behind, and she stabs the clown in the crotch 
   with a knife and he falls down some stairs. Debbie unmasks the clown 
   and it turns out <A HREF="psycho_sleepover_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/psycho sleepover dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    be Carl, who says, &quot;I only wanted a blowjob!&quot; Debbie then 
   asks Carl if he has any STDs and he says no. He asks why and Debbie 
   says &quot;Because I'm about to be covered in your blood!&quot; as 
   she hacks away at him with the axe (Don't expect any gore, just lots 
   of blood being tossed by someone offscreen onto Debbie). One year 
   later, the 16 year-old Debbie (actress Rachel Castillo clearly looks 
   to be in her mid-20's) is invited by popular girls Ginny (Emilia 
   Richeson), Sally (Ariel Teal Toombs) and Ugly Jen (Frankie Frain; a 
   fat male with a retainer who dresses in women's clothing) to come to 
   their sleepover party that night. Debbie accepts and goes home to 
   tell her mother (Lenore Cutler), where we find out that Debbie's 
   father was a serial killer and her mother has invited psychiatrist 
   Dr. Thomas Algernon (Tom Adrian Villalobos) to come talk to her. 
   Instead of asking her pertinent questions, Dr. Algernon hits on 
   Debbie and slides his business card down her pants before he leaves. 
   Once at the sleepover, it become apparent that this is going to be a 
   deadly night, because Ginny finds Dr. Algernon's card and calls him 
   up to invite him to the party. The good doctor mentions the address 
   to the bunch of psychos he is watching over and walks out of the 
   mental institution, not locking the door. Head psycho Mr. Danny 
   Glover (Thom Sigsby), who walks around with a talking sock puppet (I 
   told you this was going to be bad), lets all the other psychos out of 
   the institution and they head over to Ginny's house (They first go to 
   the wrong address and kill a man wearing pink underwear and holding a 
   tiny dog). Meanwhile, horny teens Jeremy (Ryan Martin) and Flick 
   (Todd Pritchett), who has never had an erection, spy though Ginny's 
   windows after learning of the sleepover. As the psychos arrive at 
   Ginny's house, it is revealed that Ginny, Sally and Ugly Jen are also 
   psychotic killers and want Debbie to join them since her father was a 
   serial killer and she killed Carl a year earlier. Debbie says no and 
   suddenly the entire inside of the house is covered in plastic (Where 
   in the hell did they find time to do that? I think since because they 
   were filming at a real house, they didn't want to have to pay the 
   cleaning bills for removing fake blood from the walls and carpets.). 
   A mysterious man in a grey cape and hood saves Debbie's life. It 
   turns out that he is actually Dr. Algernon and he wants this to be 
   the final living night for all the psychos in town (Even though Ginny 
   stabs him in the stomach and steps on the knife handle for good 
   measure, he returns later on as if nothing happened!). Long story 
   short, Ugly Jen has his/her face torn off by one of the 
   institutionalized psychos, Debbie kills Sally, Flick finally gets an 
   erection when a big-breasted black woman stabs him repeatedly, Dr. 
   Algernon kills both Mr. Danny Glover and his sock puppet and Ginny 
   shoots Jeremy and Dr. Algernon in the head. She then slices Debbie's 
   throat as her mother appears at the door because Debbie forgot to 
   bring her pajamas with her. When she sees what Ginny has done, Mrs. 
   Dickey suddenly has two shotguns in her hands (Where was she hiding 
   them?), tells Ginny, &quot;You don't fuck with the Dickeys!&quot; and 
   pulls the triggers, splattering Ginny's brains on the wall. That's it 
   folks.&nbsp; You know a film is trouble when it takes two directors 
   to make it, in this case Adam Deyoe (<B><A HREF="dead_season_2011.htm">DEAD
    SEASON</A></B> - 2011) and Eric Gosselin (the gay bigfoot film <B><A HREF="yeti_a_love_story_2006.htm">YETI:
    A LOVE STORY</A></B> - 2006, which he also co-directed with Deyoe), 
   who also co-produced and contributed to Kurt Kroeber's screenplay. 
   The only real gore shown is when Ugly Jen's face is torn off, but it 
   is done so badly, it's pathetic (He/she turns up later with a sack 
   over his/her head, looking like the Elephant Man). The rest of the 
   stabbings, throat slicings and other killings are nothing more than 
   blood spurting out of prop knives or blood and brain matter being 
   thrown against walls or floors. This was supposed to be a comedy, but 
   it is nothing but a comedy of errors. I didn't laugh once and if you 
   have half a brain in your head, neither will you. Just stay away from 
   this incoherent, sloppy mess (It's idea of humor is 
   &quot;tea-bag&quot; men, not once, but twice). Troma president Lloyd 
   Kaufman puts in his patented 5-second cameo as a TV news anchorman 
   who is shown just after Felissa Rose gets her throat cut live on-air. 
   Also starring screenwriter Kurt Kroeber as fat slob Barry Goldwater 
   (is nothing sacred?), who wants Debbie to also give him a blow job. 
   Featuring Nick Tully and Adam Malamut as Ginny and Sally's 
   boyfriends, who are nothing but lambs for the (fake-looking) 
   slaughter and John McPhee as Mr. Dickey. A <A HREF="http://www.troma.com">Troma

    Christine hires Eye (Fadali) to be their guide to find her real 
   mother's birthplace. From here on in, it is nothing but constant 
   bickering (the girls say &quot;Shut up!&quot; an awful lot to their 
   supposed male friends) and Christine accuses Eye of getting them lost 
   (even though he is using a GPS system). They soon run into a pregnant 
   girl (Fadzlinda) and a mean Malay Elder (Rahman Boy), who beats the 
   pregnant girl to death. The group then learns the legend of &quot;The 
   Pontianak&quot; where, and I quote: &quot;A Malay girl who dies of 
   childbirth or by the abuse of a man, returns as an undead spirit 
   seeking revenge.&quot;&nbsp; Not long after that, members of the 
   group start seeing the spirit of the girl who was just killed and 
   hear a baby crying. Those that see her usually end up dead in a few 
   minutes and before you can say, &quot;Hey, look over there!&quot;, 
   members of the group are being killed one by one. This crap goes on 
   for over sixty minutes, as the surviving members bicker with each 
   other, accuse each other and, stereotypes of stereotypes, split up 
   when they can't agree with each other (a well-worn plot device to 
   kill people when no one else is around and the camera doesn't has to 
   film it, saving on a special effects budget.). It all ends up with 
   Charity being the final survivor, as she hides behind a bamboo wall 
   (all we can see are her eyes) as the dead spirit woman and the sound 
   of a baby draws nearer. Then the film ends! I won't get into all the 
   things done wrong in this film, because there are so many (such as 
   acting so bad, it makes a kid in a third grade play look like Sir 
   Laurence Olivier) and, reportedly, the financial backer pulled-out in 
   the middle of the film, forcing one-named Djinn to alter the rest of 
   the film to finish it, but here are just a few: It is all shot with 
   hand-held digital cameras that are always moving, sometimes missing 
   out on some important pieces of the action (but it is not as 
   herky-jerky, shakey-cam like most &quot;found footage&quot; films). 
   There is absolutely no nudity or extreme violence; only a shot of Luc 
   puking bugs and white liquid out of his mouth and a really quick, 
   bloodless shot of Eye being beheaded by the Malay Elder. The sound 
   recording seems to come directly from the cameras because the further 
   the camera is away from the actors, the lower their dialogue sounds 
   (some of it is downright unintelligable). The worst thing of all is 
   why Charity would ask Raymond to come with her to trek through the 
   jungle, since he walks with the help of a cane! I mean, c'mon, would 
   you ask a friend with a cane to go hiking in some unknown jungle with 
   you? And then Charity yells at him when he can't keep up with the 
   rest of the group! Some friend. No wonder her mother put her up for 
   adoption! Besides one good morphing scene where the spirit girl 
   reveals her actual identity, there is nothing of interest here for 
   even the most patient of viewers, It is just 86 minutes of 
   insufferable boring and painful torture for those who choose to watch

   and Troy (Aaron Peaslee), who set gay rights back at least 100 years 
   (Colton actually calls Sam a &quot;cockgoblin&quot; in one of the 
   film's many cringeworthy dialogue scenes). Mr. Jefferson decides 
   rather than spending the detention time in a room, they will all make 
   a trip to Cushing's Wax Museum, where head curator, the 
   eyepatch-wearing Charles Frank (Thurber), begins to explain what 
   movies all the wax figure were from (some are good [such as the two 
   of Christopher Lee] and some are outright terrible; the good ones 
   came from a real local wax museum nearby). Ashley tells Colton this 
   would be the perfect place to have sex at night and they should come 
   back tonight to do it, but the stupid slut says it so loud that 
   everyone (everyone!) hears her say it. That night, Ashley and Colton 
   break into the wax museum, have sex in a coffin and are scared half 
   to death by Vermin (Jesse Dufault), a punk rock band member who is a 
   friend of Zoey's. Yes, you guessed it, all the students are there and 
   explore the wax museum, including a secret passage they discover. 
   Charles Frank is actually the Great Great Grandson of Victor 
   Frankenstein and he is using the dead body of Ryan and some new

   fashion (gory as in a high school play type of way; there are lots of 
   exposed intestines and hearts, but the way it is done is strictly 
   amateurish; even an eye popping out of a skull is nothing but an 
   obvious cheap CGI effect), have sex (both straight and gay, but no 
   nudity whatsoever; one of the gay guys actually wears suspender 
   jeans!), run around meeting Charles' failures (more bad make-up 
   jobs), even a zombified Adolph Hitler (Charles worked with the Nazis) 
   and a strange woman behind a tiny door. Charles revives Ryan with a 
   jolt of electricity and his new monster immediately turns against his 
   master, putting Charles' body on a table and jolting him to death 
   with electricity. Katherine and the monster Ryan walk out of the wax 
   museum hand-in-hand and forget that there was just a mass slaughter 
   in the building they just left. Isn't love grand?&nbsp; The majority 
   of the blame for this piece of crap disguised as a film (besides the 
   lousy actors) lies directly on the shoulders of 
   director/producer/co-writer (with Seth Chitwood) Richard Griffin (<B><A HREF="disco_exorcist_2011.htm">THE

   mention), who offers the audience nothing but 76 minutes of boredom 
   (not the 85 minutes listed on the DVD sleeve, thank God!) with 
   underwritten characters so unreal, they seem to jump out of a bad 
   comic book (Why is Katherine so determined to find Ryan? It is never 
   discussed in the film, except for a confusing nightmare she is having 
   while Ryan is being dragged away in the beginning of the film.).

   to the title it is now, we finally do realize the Michael Thurber is 
   no Vincent Price. Hell, he couldn't even hold Mr. Price's water. He 
   overacts to the point of distraction. I guess he is supposed to come 
   off funny, but he is more annoying than anything else. Do yourself a 
   favor and don't get sucked-in by the DVD artwork like I did (That 
   creature never appears in the film) and spend your hard-earned bucks 
   on something more important, like laser hair removal for that mole on 
   your ass. This is nothing but a giant turd shaped like a DVD. To show 
   how really bad the film is, late director Jess Franco is thanked in 
   the final credits. That is not a ringing endorsement to me. Also 
   starring Nathaniel Sylva, Mary Paolino (who speaks with a thick Bronx 
   accent), Andre Boudreau and Christopher L. Ferreira as the Creature.

   disaster's biggest problem is the cinematography. There probably 
   wasn't one button Montalvan didn't use on the video camera, as he 
   gives it a fake grindhouse look, complete with fake emulsion 
   scratches, dirt specks, jumping frames, and reddish color at the 
   corners, like the film is beginning to turn vinegar. But the worst 
   aspect of the cinematography is that it is shot mostly out-of-focus 
   and given a sickly yellow palette. It's a very hard film to watch, 
   not because of the subject matter, but because it looks terrible and 
   you'll be doing more squinting than when you were a kid trying to 
   watch scrambled porn on your cable box. The story is a simpleton's 
   dream: Grandpa (S.E. Feinberg) gives his three grandchildren a 
   choice: Either he will read them the children's story &quot;Bouncy 
   Bunny&quot; (a fake book with lousy artwork) or he can tell them the

    take a rocket scientist to figure out what the kids want to hear and 
   we switch over to cannibal Carl Henry Jessup (Paul E. Respass, who 
   died of a heart attack on April 21, 2014) as he is sitting at the 
   edge of the river contemplating his life. We hear his thoughts, such 
   as &quot;Ever since the Civil War, this country's been one big 
   pussy.&quot; (the word &quot;pussy&quot; is used a lot in this film). 
   When Carl was a young boy, he watched as his father killed his mother 
   and then cut his own throat. Just before Daddy died, he slips his 
   favorite butcher knife to his son and tells him, &quot;It's yours 
   now!&quot; (No? Really? I thought the neighbor down the street would 
   want it.). Carl likes to kill people who trespass on his land, 
   butcher them (we watch him cut up a woman in his bathtub and see her 
   severed ear and head) and his friend Rae Lynn (Theresa Holly) comes 
   over to cook and clean for him (she is related to him somehow, but it 
   is never made clear how), not knowing the meat she is cooking is 
   &quot;long pig&quot; (i.e. human flesh). Carl performs a religious 
   ritual to a demon called Sam Bakoo (Allen East), where he says he 
   would gladly trade his soul to have his Mama and Papa alive again (he 
   keeps their mummified corpses in an upstairs bedroom), but the ritual 
   doesn't seem to work. He is visited by a ghost girl named Jessie 
   (Marie Moreshead), who tells Carl that Sam Bakoo is real and that his 
   family is cursed. Carl continues to kill people, such as a hunter who 
   is taking a shit on his property (complete with fart and shit noises 
   and the hunter exclaiming, &quot;Oh, that is wet!&quot;) and a 
   picnicking couple (when the male tries to kiss the female, she says 
   &quot;I am not ready for tongue yet!&quot;) and butchers them in his 
   basement meat locker (The male picnicker gets away thanks to help 
   from ghost girl Jessie). Carl has dreams about Sam Bakoo and tries to 
   bury a box that contains Sam's deathmask on the top, but it 
   mysteriously reappears in his meat locker with a small bottle of 
   Carl's blood inside. Carl's best friend, the horny Billy Wayne (Chris 
   Shumway), asks Carl if he can take out Rae Lynn on a date and Carl 
   gives his blessing. When Billy Wayne tries to rape Rae Lynn and 
   punches her in the face, Carl sees what he has done to her and has 
   Billy Wayne drink a mason jar of moonshine spiked with rat poison and 
   he dies (with bloody froth coming out of his mouth). When Rae Lynn 
   learns that she has been cooking human flesh all this time (she 
   discovers Carl's mother's mummified corpse in her bed and the bedroom 
   is full of human body parts), she runs away with Carl chasing her. 
   She turns the tables on Carl and kills him with his Daddy's butcher 
   knife and then throws the knife in the river. We then hear a 
   fake-sounding 1920's version of 'My Blue Heaven&quot; as we then see 
   Carl tied to a chair in Hell, with his Daddy cackling and pulling out 
   Carl's tonails and teeth with a pair of pliers while Sam Bakoo dances 
   around him. Carl screams and the film ends, but after the end credits 
   roll, we see Grandpa again giving his grandkids one final scare (if I 
   had a grandfather like that, I would never visit him!).&nbsp; The 
   film is just awful and full of dialogue that makes your eyes roll in 
   back of your head, such as when Carl chases a couple of drunk teens 
   off his property and says, &quot;Hell, that meat wasn't ripe 
   anyway!&quot;. The film makes absolutely no sense, especially the Sam 
   Bakoo and Jessie parts, and director Montalvan shows up every now and 
   then as a drunk hillbilly who keeps ogling Rae Lynn from afar (and 
   grabbing his crotch), only to end up being cut up alive, screaming as 
   Carl pulls out his intestines and removes an eyeball with a knife and 
   eats it. This is the film's only decent makeup effect, as the rest of 
   the film is fake-looking slit throats (it's apparent it is the knife 
   spurting blood, as the skin is not cut at all) and body parts shown 
   after the butchering. There are other head-scratching bits, such as 
   when Rae Lynn kills Carl. She folds his hands at his chest and lays 
   an orchid on his body (where did she find an orchid without leaving 
   his body????) before throwing the butcher knife in the river. And 
   speaking of Rae Lynn: If she was such a good cook as the film 
   portrays her, how could she not know that the meat she was cooking 
   was human after cooking for Carl all these years? And how come during 
   this whole time (since she also cleans his house) she has never been 
   in the upstairs bedroom? The film is full of things that make 
   absolutely no sense and, at at 99 minutes long, it's is a chore to 
   sit through. You'll never want to see anything yellow again (I quit 
   eating bananas after watching this film!). Do yourself a favor and 
   skip this abomination, which supposedly won 6 awards at the 
   Pollygrind Film Festival. If this is Pollygrind's example of a good 
   film, remind me to never watch another one that they recommend. Also

    ROTTENTAIL</A></B> - 2004) and executive produced by Fred Olen Ray 
   through his company Retromedia Entertainment, is one of the worst 
   developed films I have seen in quite a while. It is also so short in 
   length that the opening is a highlight reel of the film's best moment 
   (and by saying &quot;best&quot;, I don't mean good) and the end 
   credits crawl so slow, they last for ten minutes, making for a 
   77-minute film. Even at that short length, it still seemed like 
   watching an 8-hour mini-series, but without much of a plot. Also, the 
   film says Eric Roberts is the main star, but we NEVER see his face. 
   We only hear his voice, while someone else plays him as a masked 
   warlock sitting down at a table, in dialogue that could have been 
   recorded in less than thirty minutes. It also has CGI that is so bad, 
   a grade school kid can do better (if you are going to shoot a 
   no-budget horror film, the least you can do is give your audience 
   good old-fashioned practical effects, not CGI blood). After the

   - 2007), we then see the masked warlock with Eric Roberts' voice, as 
   he spouts gobblety-gook about a witch named Abigail Wilmont who was 
   killed in the 1700's because she was a witch and now the warlock 
   wants her to get revenge by killing five of the ancestors of those 
   who murdered her, using the &quot;Book Of The Dead&quot; (actually 
   Abigail's diary). We then switch to Tiffany (Krysten St. Pierre) and 
   her three friends, Aric (Michael Merchant), Bree (Cassandra Hayes) 
   and Dig (Houston Baker, who also composed and sings the film's 
   closing tune), as they are coming back from helping people from the 
   devastation of Hurricane Courtney (not even a real hurricane!). 
   Tiffany and her friends are now going to Amityville to see her sick 
   grandmother Florence (Yolie Canales) at the &quot;Old Wilmont 
   Place&quot; and make sure she is OK. They are just about there when 
   they see young woman Charlayne (Danielle Donahue) standing in the 
   snow next to her car. The group stop and Aric fixes her car and then 
   proceed to Grandma's house. Charlayne lets her dog Snappy out of the 
   car to do his business and when he doesn't return, she goes looking 
   for him, where she finds a human skull in the snow and a noose 
   hanging from a tree. She is then killed by her own dog (at least I 
   think it was Snappy; the film is edited haphazardly) as we hear the 
   warlock say, &quot;Five more must die before the dawn!&quot; (Wait a 
   minute, didn't he say in the beginning that only five would die?). 
   Tiffany and her friends make it to Grandma's house (it's a plain 
   house with two of the Amityville House's iconic windows added by 
   obvious CGI!), only to find the outside of the house in disrepair 
   (with an animal's skull on the stairs). Tiffany discovers her 
   grandmother Florence (a really bad old-age makeup job) upstairs in 
   bed babbling incoherently and Tiffany finds the Book Of The Dead on 
   her night table and takes it. Fisherman Ernest (Todd Carpenter) is 
   the second one to die when Abigail reaches from under the water and 
   pulls him under. Sheriff McGrath (Kevin VanSant) just misses seeing 
   this as he was talking to Ernest moments earlier before driving away. 
   Squirrel hunter Wardell (Steve Diasparra) is the third to die when he 
   discovers Abigail hanging from a tree and she rips his eyes out (in 
   one of the film's other few practical effects). Bree then cuts her 
   hand on the Book Of The Dead and the infection spreads, while Tiffany 
   reads a witches spell out loud from the book (I know it makes no 
   sense. Nothing here does). Zeke (Jeff Kirkendall) &amp; Gilly (Austin 
   Dragovich), two local troublemakers, are the fourth and fifth victims 
   when Abigail rips Gilly's head off (off-screen) and the film freezes 
   when Abigail has her hands around Zeke's neck (I guess they didn't 
   have anything in the budget to show either death). Things go crazy in 
   Grandma's basement when Aric &amp; Dig become possessed and try to 
   drown Bree in a vat of water. They see that Tiffany has six breasts 
   (another terrible effect) and Dig yells out &quot;She has the witch's 
   teats!&quot; (What the Fuck?!?). The possessed duo try to strangle 
   Tiffany but she must have some sort of supernatural power, because 
   both Dig and Aric snap out of it. The rotting Abigail scratches Dig's 
   face as he plants an axe in her body and Aric finishes her off by 
   crushing her head with his foot. Tiffany goes upstairs to destroy the 
   Book Of The Dead, but she is met by her possessed Grannie. Tiffany 
   manages to knock her head off with a few punches to Grannie's head 
   (another terrible effect) and goes to the basement, where she starts 
   tearing pages out of the book. She tells Aric that they must burn the 
   pages to send Abigail's spirit to Hell (Wait a minute, wouldn't it be 
   easier just to burn the book as a whole?), while Bree sprouts giant 
   legs and turns into a spider (a combination of CGI, physical and 
   Brett Piper's stop motion effects, which is the scene the film opened 
   with, so it comes as no surprise at all!). Aric is killed by a scythe 
   held by once-again possessed Dig and Tiffany sets fire to the pages, 
   which causes the house to explode in mere seconds (in one of the 
   worst CGI scenes I ever laid my eyes upon). We then cut to the 
   Sheriff watching video from Tiffany's video camera, which was pulled 
   out of the wreckage. He spots Abigail in some of the frames in the 
   video when he gets a call from his ex-wife Veronica (Kathryn Sue 
   Young) that Tiffany is at her store. But is it even Tiffany? Do you 
   really care?&nbsp; Director Mark Polonia (who also plays the 
   Sheriff's deputy Sully) still hasn't learned to make a coherent film 
   since he started out in the 80's. There is absolutely nothing to 
   recommend here, even the spider transformation, which looks to have 
   been done on the cheap and in a hurry. Polonia's over-reliance on 
   dime-store CGI (a trait in Fred Olen Ray's softcore films that show 
   on cable all the time) and Dalton's non-linear and confusing 
   screenplay will give you a headache, as will all the actors' terrible 
   thespian talents (yes, every one of them). Krysten St. Pierre is 
   especially awful, as she only seems to have one expression and speaks 
   her dialogue in monotone. Eric Roberts probably owed someone a favor 
   or did the warlock voice for some quick booze or blow money. I have 
   no idea why this film was even made, but do yourself a favor and just 
   pass this one by. It really has nothing to do with Amityville and it 
   is about a scary as a baby's dirty diaper. A Bayview Entertainment

   face it, you know you're about to see something awful when three 
   directors are listed for one 79-minute film (and, no, it's not an 
   anthology) and the third director is listed as being in charge of 
   &quot;Completion Footage&quot; (Believe me, that is never a good 
   sign). The film starts out well enough: In a black &amp; white 
   flashback (tinted a gold color) we see a sign dated 1547 in a town 
   called Knob's Creek (Alright, enough with the snickering!), where 
   Christopher Wicker (Ed Pope) is mourning the death of his young 
   daughter, who died of consumption (who we saw a couple of minutes 
   earlier opening her eyes while in her coffin, revealing completely 
   white eyes with no pupils), and then revealing that he has the symbol 
   of the pentagran burned into the palms of both of his hands. The 
   opening credits begin to roll (dark red type on a black background, 
   never a good choice of complimenting colors) and we watch as 
   Christopher cuts off one of his fingers in some satanic ritual, as he 
   curses God and uses his own blood to draw the sign of an upside-down 
   cross on his chest. He sits in the middle of a pentagram drawn on the 
   floor with his blood, while we hear a disembodied voice speaking 
   Latin and a rocking chair moving on its own. Christopher then turns 
   into a sharp-clawed, pointy-teeth creature (now portrayed by Walter 
   Phelan, who was &quot;Dr. Satan&quot; in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#House 1000 Corpses">HOUSE
    OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> - 2002). The creature then attacks a young

    about how all their children are being mutilated or end up missing 
   and want to know what they can do to stop it. One man says 
   Christopher Wicker is to blame because &quot;he's in league with the 
   Devil&quot; (which he actually is) and an old bearded coot (who can't 
   act a lick) offers to take them into the woods, where he says Wicker 
   is hiding in a location called &quot;Devil's Den&quot; and they can 
   put an end to all the children dying by killing Wicker. Without even 
   questioning the old coot, off they go, armed with axes, meat cleavers 
   and pickaxes and get to Devil's Den, where they discover the 
   mutilated decapitated head of the recently missing Puritan girl. The 
   Puritans see the creature eating another human body and discarding 
   its head, as one of the Puritans plants a pickaxe into the creature's 
   stomach, only for the creature to return the favor by thrusting his 
   clawed hand through the Puritan's head. Another man strikes the 
   creature with an axe. He has his head crushed between the creature's 
   hands. When another Puritan puts a noose around the creature's head 
   and tries to hang it, the creature splits the man's head in two and 
   eats his brains. The creature then mutilates a Puritan woman's body 
   and rips the bearded old coot's head off (Do you see a pattern 
   developing here?). As its final act, the creature then slices the 
   final Puritan woman's (she's the mother of the recently missing girl) 
   throat, strips her topless and rips into her body until a wall is 
   covered in blood, the black &amp; white footage turning to full color 
   (Paging Quentin Tarantino!). The film then switches to the present 
   day, where five young, stupid adults, Allison (Elizabeth O'Brick), 
   Winter (Johnny Moreno), Kelly (Lira Kellerman), Matt (Eric L. 
   Wolfson) and Nicole (Alissa Koenig), stop their SUV to get some gas 
   at a backwoods gas station, where the butt-ugly attendent 
   (co-director Darrin Reed) looks like he was burned all over his face. 
   Can you guess where these stupid people are heading? That's right, 
   they are going to Devil's Den to check out rumors they read on the 
   internet. After getting a warning by the malformed attendent, they go 
   on their way, but when they are traveling in the woods, their SUV 
   mysteriously stops and the lights go out. Instead of walking back to 
   the gas station, they decide to forge ahead and camp out for the 
   night where, around a campfire, Allison mentions the legend of the 
   creature of Knob's Creek and how it cannot be destroyed until it 
   avenges the death of his daughter. I could go on and tell you how 
   these idiotic people end up getting killed one-by-one, but none of it 
   is gory in the least. It looks like the filmmakers blew their entire 
   budget on the really gory effects in the film's first ten minutes. 
   All the deaths in the color footage are off-screen. While there is a 
   topless woman roaming the woods covered in blood and a sub-story 
   about a couple of stoners discovering her, only to be killed by the 
   creature (again off-screen), the closest the rest of the film comes 
   to gore is when a torso of a camper is dumped on a campfire, forcing 
   the last four of the stupid people to split in two: the men and the 
   women. Every once in a while Christopher Wicker's ghost daughter 
   makes an appearance, telling the idiotic young adults that her father 
   is &quot;trapped&quot;. Will Winter get hives by eating a strawberry 
   energy bar because he is allergic to strawberries? Will the girls 
   lift Christopher's curse? Will this 79 minutes ever end? If you 
   answered &quot;No&quot; to these three questions, you are absolutely 
   correct, Directors Darrin Reed and Miguel F. Valenti still haven't 
   directed another film, and Mark Villalobos, who is credited as 
   directing the &quot;Completion Footage&quot; is better known as 
   Special Effects Technician (he is also listed as Supervisor of 
   Special Effects on this film), working on such films as <B><A HREF="army_of_darkness_1992.htm">ARMY
    OF DARKNESS</A></B> (1992); <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Reeker">REEKER</A></B>

   (2008) and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HillsRunRed">THE HILLS RUN RED</A></B> 
   (2009), all much better films than this piece of shit. The film has a 
   severely disjointed feel, which is why Reed and Valenti never 
   directed another film. It is obvious that they bit off more than they 
   could chew and Villabos was able to cobble the film together to make 
   it releasable (but just barely). The screenwriters, Michael Ferrara 
   (who also has a role in the film) and Oren Kamara (not surprisingly, 
   their only screenplay at the time of this review), make sure they 
   don't miss one &quot;terror in the woods&quot; cliche, as the hikers 
   always make the stupidest decisions they possibly can, especially 
   when they discover Kelly is missing and they continue on their trek, 
   not even worrying about whether Kelly is in trouble or worse. Really 
   nice friends, aren't they? Mix-in a well-telegraphed 
   &quot;surprise&quot; ending and an epilogue showing that two weeks 
   later, Winter is still trapped in the woods (He has to be the 
   stupidest person on Earth to still be in Devil's Den two weeks after 
   he arrived there!) and you have a film that would make retards

    HUNTER</A><A NAME="ZombieHunter2013"></A> (2013) -</B> Well, here we 
   go again. Another freshman director decides to make his first&nbsp; 
   movie a horror film and it's a zombie film at that. Actually it's a 
   zombie comedy. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of zombie 
   comedies, especially if they are done right. Right off the top of my 
   head, I can think of <B><A HREF="shaun_of_the_dead_2003.htm">SHAUN OF

   on the other hand, can't hold a candle to those films because it is 
   about as funny as a baby dying of A.I.D.S. (and for you politically 
   correct people out there: Fuck you! You can censor yourself when you 
   have your own website!). The film is a mess of cliched ideas (take a 
   little <B><A HREF="mad_max_1979.htm">MAD MAX</A></B>, mix it with 
   religious fanaticism and end it with a bit of self-sacrifice. For the 
   rest of the film it is either kill or be killed.) that mix together 
   as well as oil and water. And it's apparent that director/co-writer 
   Kevin King (<B><A HREF="cyborg_x_2015.htm">CYBORG X</A></B> - 2015; 
   also featuring Danny Trejo) hasn't got a single clue how a horror 
   film should be made, because 95% of the kills are done using CGI 
   (everyone bleeds a nearly neon pink color and their CGI blood always 
   &quot;hits&quot; the camera lens), the CGI monsters are pathetic and 
   women make love with their bras on. Now tell me, would you watch a 
   film like that? To add insult to injury, the &quot;name&quot;<A HREF="zombie_hunter_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/zombie hunter dvd8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="298" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="2" BORDER="0"></A> 
   star, Danny Trejo, makes three short appearances in the film (which 
   probably ate up 75% of the film's paltry budget) and dies halfway 
   through it, making the rest of the movie insufferable to sit through. 
   And let's also be brutally honest: Is anyone else besides me sick and 
   tired of posters made for new films purposely made to look like 
   beat-up posters from the 70's, with fold marks, yellowing at the 
   edges and creases? While the films of the 70's will be remembered 
   fondly 50 years from now, films like this piece of trash will long be 
   forgotten, no matter how old they make their posters look (I curse 
   Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez for starting the trend with their <B><A HREF="grindhouse_2007.htm">GRINDHOUSE</A></B> 
   double feature [2007], but at least they were good films). This film 
   starts out interestingly enough with three people in a living room 
   getting high off a new street drug that, as you can probably guess, 
   is highly addictive and has strange after-effects. While a female TV 
   news anchor is telling everyone that the side effects of taking the 
   drug include projectile vomiting, we see her male counterpart do just 
   that while he is sitting in the chair next to her and a 
   &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot; card appears on the TV screen (the 
   only thing I found funny in the whole film, but <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE
    SIMPSONS</A></B> use to do it a lot better, showing a <A HREF="simpsons_please_stand_by_tv_cards.htm">drunk
    guy with a bottle in his hands</A> while those words show up on 
   screen). The female anchor goes on to say that the drug turns people 
   into blood thirsty zombies and we then see one of the guys in the 
   living room take the girl upstairs for sex and bites her tongue off 
   (one of the film's very few practical effects). A year passes and the 
   entire world has turrned into a zombie paradise thanks to the drug 
   (Think about this for a minute: Why would someone sell a street drug 
   with no repeat customers?), with a few living humans here and there. 
   One of those humans happens to be loner Hunter (Australian actor 
   Martin Copping; <B><A HREF="forbidden_ground_2013.htm">FORBIDDEN GROUND</A></B> 
   - 2013; passing for American rather poorly), who drives his souped-up 
   black car and destroys &quot;Eaters&quot; along the way (We see him 
   hit a zombie called &quot;Death Angel&quot; [Jake Bushman] with his 
   car until there is nothing but pink goo all over his windshield.). 
   Hunter hasn't seen a living human being for six months, but all of a 
   sudden he is hit in the shoulder with a bullet and crashes his car 
   (and so ends our tribute to <B><A HREF="mad_max_1979.htm">MAD MAX</A></B>).
    Hunter wakes up in the compound of Father Jesus (Danny Trejo, who 
   strictly did this ordinary role for the money). Hunter is in a bed 
   while Debbie (Jean Regler), who says she hasn't seen a real man in 
   over a year, moves in for some sex action. She is interrupted by 
   Alison (Clare Neiderpruem), who has come to change the bandage on his 
   shoulder. Before Hunter meets Father Jesus (really, a priest named 
   Father Jesus?), the good father has a flashback where he kills a 
   bunch of Eaters with his Holy Axe (which he keeps hanging on his 
   wall), every one of those flashback deaths done with CGI where fake 
   pink blood hits the camera lens. When Father Jesus meets Hunter, he 
   has the Father makes Lyle (Jake Suazo), the person who shot him, take 
   him back to his car to see if it is salvagable. But before the good 
   Fathers will let that happen, Father Jesus tells him his flock's life 
   story&nbsp; and tells Hunter, &quot;Believe in good and evil. Believe 
   if you're not one, you're the other.&quot; (well duh!). He also goes 
   on to say &quot;We need hope. Make no mistake, there's a Hell and 
   you're in it!&quot; We then don't see Father Jesus again until the 
   next Eaters attack, where some awfully rendered Creature Eaters 
   appear and Father Jesus picks up his Holy Axe once again, this time 
   cutting off one of the creature's arms before he is beheaded. Once 
   Trejo is out of the film, it sinks faster than a turd swirling around 
   in a flushed toilet bowl. The remaining crew decide to try to make it 
   to an airport, where Jerry (Terry Guthrie) says he knows where a 
   single engine plane is and they can travel to a place that has white 
   sand beaches (since this film was filmed in Utah, you would think the 
   Bonneville Salt Flats would be a good substitution). After a short 
   run-in with The Funny Man Eater (Jeff Kirkham), a zombie that is 
   dressed like a clown and carries a chainsaw (whose blade length 
   changes from scene to scene), who slices Debbie in the stomach while 
   she is squatting to take a pee (so much fake CGI blood hits the 
   camera lens, you can't see how awful the CGI effect is) and Hunter 
   hits him with a pickup truck and cuts him into pieces with his own 
   chainsaw (all the while, The Funny Man is laughing) and then looking 
   in a deserted gas station's freezer and puking their guts out (we are 
   not made aware what they see), they finally make it to the airport 
   and find the plane (They also find a storage shed full of automatic 
   weapons. What are the chances?). Trouble is, it needs gas and there 
   are a horde of CGI Creature Eaters all around the airport. Hunter 
   fills up the tank while fighting off the creatures, but one of them 
   runs his clawed hand straight through Hunter's torso (a terrible CGI 
   effect, but not as horrible as Alison knocking a CGI Creature Eater 
   off her truck's roof by hitting the brakes). Jerry is also eaten 
   alive by an Eater (the only other use of practical effects that 
   weren't CGI-enhanced in this film). Hunter drops a hand grenade into 
   a puddle of gasoline, which forces the whole airport to blow up in 
   a&nbsp; (CGI) explosion, letting Allison and Ricky (Jason K. Wixom) 
   escape in their pickup truck (I guess the white-sanded beaches are 
   now out of the question). To add insult to the viewer's injury, 
   Hunter is still alive, but badly burned (How? Could someone tell me 
   how the fuck he survived since he dropped the hand grenade right at 
   his feet and his entire torso was impaled by a Creature Eater?), so 
   he takes his own life by saying &quot;If you gotta do something, you 
   gotta do it yourself!&quot; as he runs a blade across his neck. 
   Thankfully, the film is over and I never have to speak of it again.

   Remember when horror Westerns were as rare as tits on a rock? Now 
   that DTV is proving to be a money-maker, it seems that we are 
   becoming inundated with them and most of them are awful. This 
   zombie-centric one is particularly rank. It's like a diarrhetic 
   orangutan flinging his loose bowel movements&nbsp; at you and hitting 
   you in the face every time. This one not only moves slow as molasses, 
   it has the nerve to have one of the actors use the name &quot;Randall 
   Marshall Dillon&quot; as a tribute to <B><A HREF="gunsmoke_movies_1987-1994.htm">GUNSMOKE</A></B> (1955-1975),
    but I wouldn't put it pass the late James Arness to rise from the 
   grave to pull this asshole's head off and shit down his neck. And I 
   wouldn't blame Miss Kitty also rising from her tomb to give him a 
   skeletal knee to his balls. Since &quot;Randall Marshall Dillon&quot; 
   hasn't appeared in anything since, I would like to hope all of it 
   actually happened. This is also one of those films where the artwork 
   on the DVD cover is better than the film itself and the film is such 
   a low-budget affair, all they could afford was one horse (there are 
   more horses on the DVD cover then there are in the film!). One lousy 
   horse for a Western film! Still, all that runny orangutan shit 
   running down your face smells like roses when compared to actually 
   watching the film, so I'll start from the beginning and make it 
   quick, so you can go grab a towel and wipe your face. It starts out 
   with one of the worst shootouts in Western film history (there is <A HREF="dead_and_the_damned_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dead and the damned dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>something
    off about the sound of the guns, like they couldn't afford to loop 
   in better gunshot sounds after the film was finished), where bounty 
   hunter Mortimer (David A. Lockhart) kills five guys in order to 
   collect a single bounty on one guy, who he shoots in cold blood (the 
   guy is unarmed!). Mortimer tells the town's Sheriff that he needs 
   more money to help his soon-to-be-wife back in California afford a 
   farm they are looking to buy, so he asks the Sheriff to give him the 
   most expensive bounty. That turns out to be Native American Brother 
   Wolf (Rick Mora), who supposedly raped and killed a white girl (He 
   didn't. They were secretly seeing each other for a year and when her 
   father found out, he killed her and blamed the &quot;injun&quot;.). 
   Mortimer travels to Gold Rush town Whiskeytown and buys a girl named 
   Rhiannon (Camille Montgomery; I keep hearing Stevie Nicks of 
   Fleetwood Mac singing her name!), whom he intends to use as human 
   bait to trap Brother Wolf. Meanwhile, two farmers uncover a glowing 
   green rock (probably a meteorite) on their land and take it into town 
   by wheelbarrow. One of the farmers hits the rock with a pickaxe while 
   most of the town is watching and a green gas comes out of the rock, 
   turning most of the town's residents into bloodthirsty zombies (two 
   whores who weren't there get killed by their own boss; one of them 
   has her leg torn off while he chews on it. It's all done rather badly 
   and CGI-enhanced.). Mortimer knows he is on the right track when he 
   sees a human head impaled on a pike, so he ties Rhiannon up and 
   leaves her in a field as bait for Brother Wolf. When Brother Wolf 
   does show up, he frees Rhiannon and Mortimer goes to shoot him, only 
   to discover that while Mortimer was sleeping, Brother Wolf removed 
   all the bullets from his gun! They get into a badly-staged fist 
   fight, but Brother Wolf must not have checked out Mortimer thoroughly 
   because he pulls out a derringer and takes Brother Wolf prisoner. 
   Mortimer must also have to deal with another bounty hunter called 
   &quot;The German&quot; (Robert Amstler), who doesn't speak a lick of 
   English (Let that bit of information sink in for a minute), so 
   Mortimer and The German get into a gunfight, but Mortimer seems to 
   think The German is toast when he is attacked by one of the zombies 
   from town (Mortimer doesn't even act surprised. He acts like this 
   happens every day). Rhiannon frees Brother Wolf just in time before 
   he turns into zombie chow (an axe in the noggin will put them down 
   every time!). As you can probably guess by now, Mortimer, Brother 
   Wolf and Rhiannon must work together from now on if they are going to 
   survive (Actually, they don't do a great job of it). From here on in, 
   the film is nothing but the trio fighting zombies and either shooting 
   them in the head or giving them a tomahawk haircut. There's a long 
   scene where Rhiannon is alone in a bar (yes, they do split up!) and 
   must deal with a blind zombie. She keeps trying to be quiet, but 
   always fails and the blind zombie heads in her direction and Rhiannon 
   finally kills it. On the other hand, Brother Wolf's death only takes 
   a few seconds (a zombie chews out his heart and then Mortimer shoots 
   him in the head!). The film thankfully draws to a conclusion when 
   Mortimer is killed by a zombie and Rhiannon (who Mortimer gives all 
   his bounty money to and makes her promise to take it to his love in 
   California to buy the farm. But guess who just bought the farm?) is 
   saved by The German, who wasn't killed or bitten (his arm is in a 
   sling though). He speaks German (so do I and he basically says, 
   &quot;Come with me if you want to live!&quot;), but the stupid Kraut 
   (I can say that because I am German) leads them to a cliff with a 
   bunch of zombies close behind them. The film ends when both of them 
   turn around and head towards the zombies (Rhiannon only has one 
   bullet in her gun!) and the film goes to black, which is probably 
   where the 2014 sequel <B><A HREF="dead_the_damned_and_the_darkness_2014.htm">THE
    DEAD, THE DAMNED AND THE DARKNESS</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="dead_the_damned_and_the_darkness_2014.htm">THE
    DEAD AND THE DAMNED II</A></B>) begins (Actually, it doesn't. The 
   two surviving stars aren't even in the sequel!), but I will not watch 
   it, just based on how long this film's 85 minutes seemed to run. It 
   seemed like a lifetime. This is not so much a movie as it is a 
   travesty. Besides some good zombie makeups and some brief topless 
   female nudity, most of the deaths are CGI-enhanced (God, I hate CGI 
   blood!) and the story is exactly like a thousand other zombies films. 
   Even if this one supposedly takes place during Western times, the 
   lack of horses or other period articles (it looks like it was shot in 
   a Wild West theme park and cowboys wear modern Levi jeans and boots 
   with rubber soles) really hurts the film (the bullet count for 
   Mortimer's six-shooter keeps on changing throughout the film; one 
   time I saw Mortimer fire 11 shots before reloading!), as does 
   director/screenwriter Rene Perez's lack of talent when it comes to 
   shooting action scenes. I do appreciate that he doesn't use rapid 
   editing like they do in most modern DTV films, but the opposite also 
   applies, too. It would be nice if the camera moved every once in a 
   while. Lots of long takes in this film where the camera stands still. 
   What is amazing to me is that Perez still gets financing to keep 
   making his films. Besides the sequel I have already mentioned, he has 
   also made the following films in the past few years: <B><A HREF="demon_hunter_2012.htm">THE

   Yes, that's right, everyone's favorite low-budget martial artist 
   action star (who could never act a lick, but was likable anyway) 
   breaks his usual mold and stars in a lame cheapie horror film 
   Executive Produced by an uncredited Roger Corman. This film is so 
   bad, it ignores every vampire convention since Bram Stoker wrote 
   &quot;Dracula&quot; and is full of so many holes, moths are envious. 
   It also doesn't help that nearly all the vampires and other 
   characters are named after famous horror directors and personalities 
   (such as &quot;Argento&quot;, &quot;Sangster&quot;, &quot;Ulmer&quot;,
    &quot;Baker&quot;, and many more), which is really a turn-off and 
   pure laziness to boot. The film begins in March 1968, where young 
   Jack Cutter (Christopher Aguilar) is told by vampire hunter father 
   Tom (a cameo by James Lew; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Cage21994">CAGE II</A></B>

   vampires after being betrayed by long-time friend Sid (Sid Sham), who 
   tells Tom he was offered immortality by head vampire Bruno Fischer (a

   literally sleepwalks through his role and speaks in low-volume 
   monotone) by telling Tom, &quot;Drink an ounce of blood a year, 
   you'll live forever, man!&quot; Young Jack leaves his hiding place 
   when his father and mother are circled by a family of vampires and a 
   martial arts fight break out. Jack sees his mother killed and his 
   father hands Jack a book containing the names of every vampire family 
   alive and a double-barrel shotgun, throwing young Jack out a window 
   and telling him to &quot;Trust no one&quot; before Tom is killed 
   (off-screen). Jack hides outside while he watches Bruno enter the 
   house. One of the vampires tells him that the boy got away and Jack 
   looks down at the book and we are transported to June 1995, where 
   adult Jack (Wilson) is about to enter a club where the vampire family 
   that killed his mother and father are celebrating a reunion. He uses 
   the shotgun and a pair of handguns to shoot the vampires and then 
   snaps their necks with his martial arts prowess to kill them (Don't 
   think too hard about this because it will drive you crazy). Jack 
   makes a mistake when a female photographer who works for the club 
   accidentally takes his photo, so when toothpick-chewing Detective 
   Hopper (Marcus Aurelius) and county coroner Roy Ward (Michael 
   Cavanaugh; <B><A HREF="haunting_1999.htm">THE HAUNTING</A></B> - 
   1999) look at the carnage at the club, the photographer gives Det. 
   Hopper the photo of Jack, which is distributed to every precinct in 
   the city. Jack is at a warehouse he calls home and crosses out the 
   names of the vampires he just killed in the book his father gave him. 
   By the look of the names crossed-out in the book, Jack has been a 
   very busy boy since 1968. Jack is spotted by the police when he is 
   walking down an alley and a chase ensues, only for Jack to be hit by 
   a car driven by Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith; <B><A HREF="baby_doll_murders_1993.htm">THE
    BABY DOLL MURDERS</A></B> - 1993; and, yes, her character's name is 
   atrocious), a reporter for a National Enquirer-like rag who was sent 
   to Los Angeles to cover the spate of snapped-neck murders (How's that 
   for coincidence?). Jack hops into Raimy's car and tells her to drive, 
   but she is seriously wounded by a cop's bullet and crashes the car. 
   When the police get to the car, both Raimy and Jack are gone. Jack 
   has brought her back to his warehouse, where he pours a healing 
   liquid on her bullet wound and it disappears. Jack tries to explain 
   to Raimy that vampires are real, but she doesn't believe him (What 
   about her miraculous recovery from being shot? Doesn't that lend Jack 
   some credence?). Raimy soon changes her tune when female vampire 
   Tournier (Maria Ford; <B><A HREF="future_fear_1997.htm">FUTURE FEAR</A></B> 
   - 1997; doing a lousy French accent) invades the warehouse and tries 
   to kill Jack (Somehow, Jack manages to get off three shots from a 
   two-barrel shotgun!), but she leaves when she is hit by some pistol 
   fire (This is really getting ridiculous, especially when we just 
   heard Jack tell Raimy that vampires are fast healers). Meanwhile, Sid 
   (who hasn't aged a day since 1968) tells Bruno that Jack just killed 
   a family of vampires, so Bruno gathers his &quot;family&quot; 
   together (one of them is portrayed by Vincent Klyn, who played the 
   head bad guy in director Albert Pyun's <B><A HREF="cyborg_1989.htm">CYBORG</A></B> 
   [1989]) to come up with a plan to kill Jack (Just for funsies, Bruno 
   invades a house and makes a meal out of two young boys, again 
   off-screen). Raimy gets Detective Ron Browning (Cash Casey) to 
   believe that vampires are real (after Browning makes the mistake of 
   trying to handcuff Jack) and the three of them try to take down Bruno 
   and his family. I don't think I have to tell you how it turns out. If 
   there is one word I could use to describe this film, it would be: 
   Lazy. Screenwriter William C. Martell (<B><A HREF="cyber_zone_1995.htm">CYBER
    ZONE</A></B> - 1995) ignores all traditional vampire tropes and even 
   lets them walk in the sunlight, as long as they wear sunglasses to 
   protect their sensitive eyes! And why does Jack even bother to use a 
   shotgun and handguns when he knows that vampires heal quickly and 
   bullets won't kill them (And yet Sid dies of shotgun wounds in the 
   finale)? I think it is just because they could spend their special 
   effects money on bloody bullet squibs and not worry about vampires 
   that are hundreds of years old turning into dust or bursting into 
   flames when Jack snaps their necks. They just remain human-looking.

   you remember when you read or heard about some film that seemed 
   interesting, only to never be able to find a legal copy of it for 
   years? Then, you finally get your hands on a copy and your 
   anticipation was all for naught because the film sucked harder than a 
   Dyson vacuum cleaner working overtime? Well, that is the case with 
   this film, which I read about in some monster magazine in the 
   late-80's under the more appropriate title of <B><A HREF="changer_1988.htm">THE
    CHANGER</A></B> (Which is actually the on-screen title of this

   released on home video in the United States and it's easy to see why, 
   because the whole film screams &quot;amateur hour&quot;. This is a 
   badly acted story (some of the &quot;actors&quot; and 
   &quot;actresses&quot; deliver their dialogue like they are reading it 
   off of cue cards for the very first time) about an ugly slob named 
   Joe Bukowski (Carl Zschering, which, not surprisingly, is his only 
   film), who walks around the streets of Michigan (filmed on location) 
   hassling good-looking women (well, at least this film's idea of 
   good-looking) and always getting the cold <A HREF="nostril_picker_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nostril picker aka the changer dvd8a front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="319" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>shoulder.
    Or he is threatened by the cops for attempted sexual assault. That 
   is until one day he is approached on the street by a bum (Horace 
   Grimm; which describes his acting ability. This is his only film, 
   too) and he offers to teach Joe the art of 
   &quot;morphosynthesis&quot;, or the ability to chant and change 
   appearance into anyone he pleases (even a female), if Joe will let 
   him take a swig from his cheap booze bottle (The trick is Joe will 
   always see himself [unless he looks in a mirror or sees his 
   reflection in a window] and everyone else will see him as someone 
   different). The bum tells Joe he learned the chant &quot;in Vietnam 
   from some gook&quot; and the bum says that Joe should pick a song to 
   hum after the chant to make it work and to hum it again to release 
   him from the chant. Frank picks &quot;London Bridge Is Falling 
   Down&quot; to make the chant work (I know. I mean WTF?!?) and the bum 
   also warns him that using the chant &quot;will make you go crazy if 
   you do it too much&quot;, so Joe says what the hell and lets the bum 
   take a swig from his bottle. That night, Joe does the chant and then 
   whistles London Bridge, but he sees no change until he walks into an 
   adult book store and the guy behind the counter sees Joe as a young 
   teenage girl and chastises her for being in the store. Realizing that 
   the chant has worked, the lecherous Joe enrolls in an all-girl high 
   school under the name &quot;Josephine&quot;, where he can get to see 
   teenage girls naked in the locker room (too bad the viewer doesn't) 
   and do all kinds of things to see the girls in as less clothes as 
   possible (This is the only time we see him pick his nose, as he is 
   sitting behind a desk in a classroom and wipes the booger under the 
   desk). Joe/Josephine makes friends with Brenda Kearn (Aimee Molinaro) 
   and she invites Josephine to come over to her house because her 
   parents will be gone and they can watch &quot;Attack Of The Cannibal 
   Girls&quot; on Horror Showcase on TV. Once he gets to Brenda's house, 
   he goes into the kitchen and hums London Bridge, where he sees 
   himself change from a teenage girl to his slob self in a reflection 
   in the kitchen window. He then cuts off Brenda's fingers with his 
   switchblade and then mutilates her body (cannibalism is implied). The 
   police are baffled, as the coroner stuffs pieces of Brenda's body 
   into a clear plastic bag (&quot;Oh, here are the fingers!&quot;). The 
   next girl Joe/Josephine kills is Tracy Harper (Heidi M. Gregg), whom 
   he butchers in the bushes and we see him eat some of her flesh. One 
   of Josephine's classmates is Jennifer Armstrong (Laura Cummings), who 
   is the daughter of Detective Vince Armstrong (Edward Tanner), who 
   just happens to be in charge of solving the murders. Joe/Josephine 
   picks up a hooker from the streets and brings her back to his 
   apartment, only to discover that the hooker is actually a 
   transvestite (Steven Andrews), so Josephine tries to kill the trannie 
   with a dildo (!), only for the transvestite to knock Josephine out, 
   where he sees Josephine turn into Joe. The transvestite goes to the 
   police and reports what he has seen, but even though they don't 
   believe him, they still send a couple of detectives to Joe's 
   apartment, but he slams the door in their faces because they don't 
   have a warrant. The bum gets a case of the guilts about what he has 
   done and calls the police, while Joe/Josephine is savagely stabbing 
   schoolgirl Crisi Stroud (Gail Didia) at a baseball field, taking 
   bites out of her flesh. As Joe becomes crazier and crazier, a TV news 
   cameraman gets footage of &quot;Josephine&quot; at one of the murder 
   sites. but the camera never lies and shows Joe instead. Detective 
   Armstrong now knows he has his prime suspect, especially when he 
   reads his extensive yellow sheet and talks to Joe's former 
   psychiatrist, who tells Armstrong that Joe has suicidal tendencies 
   (he once unsuccessfully attempted it) after he killed his mother 
   years ago and ate her body. Joe now goes full-tilt loony tunes, as he 
   sees his mother in his apartment, as well as his three recent 
   blood-soaked victims, who yell out &quot;You bastard!&quot; in 
   unison. Joe goes out in the streets and slices the throat of the 
   transvestite in retribution and Armstrong and another detective chase 
   him. Detective Armstrong has Joe cornered and we hear a couple of 
   shots ring out. When Detective Armstrong gets home, he sits on 
   Jennifer's bed and we hear him hum London Bridge. He becomes Joe and 
   stabs Jennifer over and over with his switchblade, as her blood 
   squirts all over his face. THE END.&nbsp; If I make any of this sound 
   interesting, I apologize, because this barely feature-length film (76 
   minutes) is one of the worst acted pieces of tripe I have ever laid 
   my eyes upon (I swear, one of them bled!). It's no wonder this is the 
   only directorial effort of Mark Nowicki (who makes a living digitally 
   color-correcting films and TV shows for DVD and Blu-Ray release, the 
   most famous being the 201 episodes of <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
    X-FILES</A></B> [1993 - 2002]), as he has no idea how to transition 
   from scene to scene and all his actors (95% of them which never did 
   any other film) speak in monotone or can plainly be seen looking at 
   the director to see where they should stand. It's also no surprise 
   that this was the only screenplay by Steven Hodge, who had a pretty 
   unusual angle for a horror film, but litters it with so many 
   clich&eacute;s, it becomes ridiculous. Everything about this film 
   looks like it was done by first-timers, including the sound 
   recording, editing, photography, makeup effects and music, which are 
   all sub par (The ending, where Joe stabs Jennifer, looks like some 
   guy just offscreen is squirting blood into Joe's face and there are 
   white pieces of cardboard covering the names of businesses who didn't 
   want their name on-screen in this turd.). Waiting 26 years to see 
   this sad excuse for a horror film was a major disappointment and 
   makes me believe some films stay obscure for a reason. Released on 
   DVD by boutique label Massacre Video (who are notorious for releasing 
   their films on &quot;limited&quot; VHS editions and then selling out 
   quickly, where then you see them up for sale on eBay for outrageous 
   prices) in a barely acceptable fullscreen print, which looks to have 
   been taken from Cinevest's (the distributor of the film) video 
   master. I have to wonder why Massacre Video sells this online with 
   the British title, since the print and the other name are much more 
   exploitable (Who wants to see a guy pick his nose? Not me.). It does 
   come with reversible cover art, so I just flipped mine over to show 
   the film's original name. The British title card is offered as an 
   extra, but offers no extra footage and there is a short interview 
   with co-producer Steve Hodge (Mark Nowicki is the other producer), 
   but I couldn't be bothered to watch it since the film was one of the 
   worst I have seen in a long, long time. There's only so much torture 
   a person can take. Do yourself a favor and spend your hard-earned 
   money on another film worthy of watching. Also starring Ann Flood,

    HOLOKAUST</A><A NAME="AmerHolokaust2013"></A> (2013) -</B> This is 
   one of the most morally reprehensible films I have ever seen. And 
   I've seen my share of reprehensible films. This film not only makes 
   you feel dirty and want to take a shower after watching it, the 
   misogyny in this film is beyond redemption. Don't take anything I say 
   as a recommendation (although there will be some sickos out there 
   that love SOV crap like this, where it is nothing but scene after 
   scene of women being degraded and slaughtered) because, in reality, 
   this film only exists to raise the shackles of everyone who watches 
   it. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities and wallows in taste so 
   bad, John Waters and Lucifer Valentine would puke (I believe the 
   closest this film comes is to Valentine's regurgitation films or 
   those &quot;Squish Videos&quot; of women in pretty shoes stepping on 
   and killing small animals). The story (if you want to call it that) 
   is a &quot;found footage&quot; video documentation of two Vietnam War 
   veterans, Michael Mashburn (Jules Sceiro) and the older Antwan Mercer 
   (Bob Glazier), torturing and killing women (and one man) because they 
   blame the war for making them that way (which is an insult to every 
   soldier who fought in any war). Their antics make the late David 
   Hess' role of Krug in <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST 
   HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> (1972) look like Mister Rogers, but at 
   least Hess had some class. These two actors are not ashamed to speak 
   some of the worst bile imaginable and Glazier, especially, likes to 
   play with his dick in front of the camera (watching an old man 
   shaking his dick around is one of the least insulting parts of this 
   film, but it's still shows a lack of basic human decency). This 
   atrocious, abominable piece of dog excrement was

   minute female revenge scene at the end, but it doesn't excuse the 71 
   minutes that comes before it). I first heard about this film after 
   reading an article about it in Issue #33 in the revived GOREZONE 
   magazine and I ordered it (it was cheap at $5.00, so I knew it had to 
   be a DVD-R, which it was, but that's no big deal with me), coming to 
   my house with both Chris Woods and John Miller signatures on the DVD 
   sleeve. I thought that was a nice touch, until I watched the film. 
   Since the film comes from a company called <A HREF="http://www.thesleazebox.com">THE
    SLEAZE BOX</A>, I now called my signed cover the &quot;DVD 
   skeeve&quot;. The film begins with an online scrawl that says what we 
   are about to see are tapes found by the New Forge Police Department 
   on Mashburn's property and goes on to say that what we are about to 
   witness are some of the most violent, humiliating and repulsive 
   manners that anyone has never seen before (No police department would 
   ever release tapes like this to the public. Never.). The opening 
   scene is of a slightly overweight hooker in a red S&amp;M leather 
   mask being walked around like a dog with a dog collar and a leash, 
   forcing her to undress Mercer naked (he shakes his dick in front of 
   her masked face) and then she climbs on top of him to give him a back 
   rub, but when Mercer is not satisfied, Mashburn shows up and 
   strangles her. They then knock out a guy videotaping his wife and 
   baby and bring all of them back to Mashburn's house (and stealing his 
   video camera, because their camera &quot;sucks&quot;), where Mashburn 
   hammers nails into the husband's eyes and makes the wife eat out of a 
   dog dish (after humiliating her in ways that I will not describe 
   because it makes me sick just thinking about it). The wife crawls on 
   all fours and begins to eat like a dog, until Mercer tells her she is 
   eating her own baby! When she refuses to eat any more, they force a 
   funnel in her mouth and pour the &quot;baby&quot; food down her 
   throat. Every once in a while, Mashburn sits in a chair and flings 
   insults at our military, saying that it is their fault for making 
   them who they are (and sending them checks every month) and their 
   mission in life now is to fuck women whenever the mood strikes, 
   &quot;no matter how degrading or rough it may be.&quot; The funny 
   thing is, Mashburn is married to Rose (Cyndi Crotts), who works as a 
   teacher at a college and supports her husband financially. Does she 
   know what her husband does (she's always telling him to get a job)? 
   We will find out in a short while. Mercer then beats the wife they 
   abducted to death with a billy club for not following his orders 
   (there is all types of military talk in this film, which makes me ill 
   just thinking about it, because these guys were never soldiers, they 
   were just psychopaths that happened to be in the military) and then 
   chows down on her innards, jerking himself off with her spleen and 
   intestines, Mashburn joining in to bite off her vagina (nothing, and 
   I mean nothing, is left to the imagination). Could this film go any 
   lower? Yes, it can. They dress as Santa Claus and unwrap a kidnapped 
   girl, killing her after the Christmas paper comes off. They also keep 
   a stable of kidnapped girls in a shed in chicken wire cages and, 
   every once in a while, Mercer goes out there, sticks his dick through 
   the wires hole and makes one of the girls kiss it. Mashburn removes 
   one girl's eyes with his bare hands while in a bathtub and then eats 
   them. Mercer kidnaps a college girl named Casey White (Audrey Hayes) 
   that Rose says she would like to fuck and makes her strip naked, wear 
   a mask and act like a maid. Mercer makes her watch his violent home 
   videos and says, &quot;That's what happens when you fuck with a dude 
   like me!&quot; Mashburn tells another story about the war, where he 
   raped a &quot;gook girl&quot; while strangling her and says, &quot;I 
   felt like a God!&quot; Rose discovers the guys have kidnapped Casey 
   and she stabs her over and over in the face with a knife until her 
   face looks like hamburger meat. We find out from some tapes that Rose 
   has been killing guys like her husband and Mercer have been killing 
   girls. Mercer's penis becomes infected from a hooker they kidnapped, 
   screwed and killed when he didn't wear a condom (we get to see an 
   extreme close-up of his infected dick). Mercer makes another 
   kidnapped girl swallow diarreha medicine and then we hear fart and 
   shit noises. The camera pans down to the liquid shit-filled toilet 
   bowl, as Mercer makes the poor girl stick her head in and drink from 
   it (I told you it could get lower.). The film then comes full-circle, 
   as the hooker we saw in the red S&amp;M mask and dog collar in the 
   beginning of the film is not actually dead. When Mercer tries to 
   stick his dick in what he thinks is her dead mouth, she bites it off, 
   duct-tapes him to a chair, slaps his face with his dismembered dick 
   and then makes him eat it. She then shoves the sharp heel of her shoe 
   into Mercer's dickless testicles until he dies (once again, none of 
   this is left to the imagination). Mashburn sees Mercer dead and he is 
   knocked unconscious. The girl has him tied-up, pulls out his teeth 
   with a pair of pliers, rips out his tongue and shoves a shotgun up 
   his ass (Shades of the finale of the 2010 remake of <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave_2010.htm">I
    SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B>). She pulls the trigger and we see that 
   the blast has blown the back of Mashburn's head off. Rose then comes 
   running through the door, knife in hand and the film goes to static. 
   An end crawl explains that police found 22 bodies on Mashburn's 
   property, along with the bodies of Mashburn and Mercer. Rose and the 
   hooker were never found, their whereabouts unknown. After 76 
   ultra-horrible minutes, this endurance test disguised as a film ends 
   (Supposedly, there's a VHS version that is four minutes longer and 
   contains the deaths of three more girls). After the end credits are 
   over, there is a short bit of film that adds nothing to the 
   movie.&nbsp; I must confess that several times I nearly broke my 
   cardinal rule of never turning off a film I am reviewing, because 
   this film is nothing but sadism for sadism's sake. But, I 
   &quot;soldiered&quot; on (Get it?) and watched the whole despicable 
   movie, but you will never see me reviewing a film made by Chris Woods 
   or John Miller on this site again (Do you hear me Mario?) Besides 
   there being enough plot holes to fill up a book about Swiss cheese 
   (Like: Who was holding the moving video camera while the hooker is 
   jamming the shotgun into Mashburn's ass?) and the filmmakers being 
   too &quot;generous&quot; with all the fake video drop-outs, 
   distortion and static (Just a note to the filmmakers: When you turn 
   off a video camera, the screen goes black, not all static. Static is 
   what happens on TVs when there is no signal.), this is the biggest 
   piece of trash that I have ever laid my eyes on. But I think that is 
   exactly what Chris Woods and John Miller were aiming for, to give 
   their company some publicity. In that case they succeeded, but they 
   also lost a lot of future potential buyers in the future, including 
   me. Anyone who sees this film as entertainment should have their 
   heads examined. Hell, they should be committed. This is the longest 
   review I have written for this section of my site, but this film 
   should get all the damnation it deserves. Also starring Rue 
   Goregrinder (Really?), Tara Caitlan, Kathleen O'Brien, Meghan 
   Christine and Jeania Ingle. Something tells me that when these young 
   women get married and have families, they will regret appearing in

   (2014) -</B> Remember &quot;Amateur Night At The Apollo&quot;, where 
   someone so bad would come out and sing so off-key that they would be 
   literally booed off-stage? Well, this movie is the equivalent of 
   that. This is one of the most amateurish films I have seen in the 
   past 20 years and my only hope is that 
   director/screenwriter/editor/co-producer Chuck Conry never gets

   movie references (many of them I agree with), but because their 
   acting stunk worse than a fish left out in the hot sun (But, believe 
   it or not, this is the best acting in the film!). Luckily, there is a 
   killer on the loose, dressed in a black suit with a red tie and 
   wearing one of those white S&amp;M hoods over his head with a zipper 
   for a mouth. He enters the house through a bathroom window and kills 
   one of teens while he is taking a shower and then takes the glasses 
   off the second victim and stabs him repeatedly with the big knife he 
   carries (the makeup effects are as bad, if not worse, than the 
   acting). Yes this is a gore film, without any realistic gore and it 
   is so cheap, when the news channel on &quot;Grundy TV&quot; (filmed 
   in Grundy, Tennessee) breaks in (from a program called &quot;Cannibal 
   Kitchen&quot;) for a special report on the two murders, the &quot;News
    6&quot; sign was definitely made by some retard with a black magic 
   marker. We then have the female newscaster (who is eventually 
   disposed of by the killer with a ball peen hammer) go on to an 
   interview with a drunk Sheriff Rollins (I refuse to name any of the 
   actors in this film because they are not actors at all; just 
   &quot;regular&quot; people trying to act and failing so badly that 
   they should ride the short bus to school), who says they weren't 
   murders at all, but actually a double suicide (!) because their house 
   was full of horror movies (Way to perpetrate the myth Chuck!). The 
   Sheriff then goes on to say that the football game will go on as 
   scheduled and then goes on a long rambling rant about how great 
   Grundy's &quot;Yellow Jacket&quot; quarterback Sky Walker is. We then 
   see Sheriff Broshdursky trying to find the location of Sky Walker's 
   house, since he thinks the killer is going to strike there (Hasn't he 
   heard of Google Maps, GPS or just calling 411?). The killer then cuts 
   the head off the girlfriend who steps out of his truck to have a 
   smoke and then gets inside the truck while we watch someone throw a 
   bucket of blood inside the truck's front window. We then see Sky 
   Walker's &quot;huge&quot; party, which consists of about 10 people. 
   Sky Walker talks about himself in the third person, which is so awful 
   since he is such a bad actor, we hope his death comes soon. All the 
   women at this party are ugly as sin, so this is one case when we hope 
   they don't remove their tops (it comes close in one situation, but it 
   is apparent that none of these girls wanted their breasts on-screen 
   and I thank them for that). Thankfully, the killer makes Sky Walker 
   his next victim after he loses a drinking contest. He goes outside to 
   throw-up and has his head run over with a car (all we see is 
   hamburger meat with a human eyeball in the middle). We then have to 
   put up with a black &amp; white &quot;tribute video&quot; of Sky 
   Walker's best moments (there must not be many because it runs less 
   than a minute) while the screen says &quot;In Memory Of Sky 
   &quot;Fucking&quot; Walker: The Greatest Grundy QB Of All Time&quot;, 
   while listening to two douchebags playing a guitar and singing a 
   tribute ballad (I threw up on my mouth a little). Rather than going 
   on with the non-plot, I'll just give you the kills: * A boy gets 
   stabbed in the stomach with the knife (it's apparent that the boy is 
   holding the knife at his side with his arm and then has his arm cut 
   off with a wood saw (the serrated edges of the blade never touch him 
   and then we see the killer pulling off a fake arm). * The killer 
   murders a girl by impaling her stomach with the boy's severed arm. * 
   A guy is kneed in his stomach by his girlfriend (who has her 
   midsection eviscerated by a crow bar, as the camera spends way too 
   much time lingering on it) and then the killer murders the boyfriend 
   by hitting him with an aluminum bat and then dropping the hood of his 
   Jeep on him. * The killer enters Sky Walker's party&nbsp; and two men 
   are stabbed in the stomach. * One guy has his eyes removed 
   (off-screen). * A girl has a knife shoved in her mouth.* The final 
   girl says the killer must have a small dick, so he opens his pants to 
   reveal a three foot penis! He smacks her across the face with it a 
   couple of times before Sheriff Brosdursky (who earlier gave a dying 
   kid his cell phone to call the police station, which was empty!) 
   empties his gun into the killer, the girl cuts off his dick with some 
   hedge clippers (and gets a face full of blood) and then beats his 
   head-in with a brick. The film stops with &quot;THE END&quot; on 
   screen, but we then see the killer get up and removed his mask. Just 
   before we see who it is, the film then shows &quot;THE END?&quot; 
   on-screen. Is this what Rue Morgue meant when they said, &quot;Sure 
   to go down in slasher film history as the weirdest finale since <B><A HREF="sleepaway_camp_1983.htm">SLEEPAWAY
    CAMP</A></B>&quot;? Really, a three-foot penis gets compared to a 
   film that had everything this film didn't? Rue Morgue needs to get 
   out more. Everything about this movie is a cheat and I can't believe 
   I spent $6.89 for this piece of crap on DVD. This film has a troubled 
   production history and it shows. In 2012, it was supposed to make 
   it's debut on VOD, but some technical glitches with the film stopped 
   it from being shown streaming (this version ran 75 minutes), so Chuck 
   Conry filmed more footage in 2013 &amp; 2014 and released a 
   &quot;Director's Cut&quot; which ran 86 minutes. It doesn't help that 
   the final closing credits run over 5 minutes (most of it listing bad 
   music by Facebook bands you never heard of that played on the 
   soundtrack) and have the nerve to thank Astron 6 (<B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#Manborg">MANBORG</A></B>

   deserve this abuse (including Don May Jr., who wouldn't touch a film 
   like this even if he were wearing a radiation suit!) This film is so 
   bad, that one actor is listed twice in the opening credits and 
   everyone else couldn't get a job in a burger joint, rather than 
   another movie. Some people should be never be allowed to direct and 
   Chuck Conry is definitely one of them. It's not even the type of film

   (2014) -</B> Since Brain Damage Films released a movie I liked (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HouseHorrorsGates12">HOUSE
    OF HORRORS: THE GATES OF HELL - 2012</A></B>; I think it was the 
   first time ever), I decided to watch this short, 75-minute horror 
   film to see if I would be surprised once again. Well, in this case, 
   lightning doesn't strike twice. This is an unbelievably bad hoorror 
   film that took two people to direct and produce (John Sove II, who 
   also edited and photographed &amp; Kristan Hanson, who also wrote the 
   &quot;screenplay&quot;; this is the last time you will see their 
   names mentioned in this short review). The film is bascially about 
   the exploits of 5 boring newbies to camping who decide to camp out in 
   the area of human face-wearing psychopath Adam Lynch (played by one 
   of the directors), who is the type of psycho who spits out awful 
   witticisms (that we can hardly hear) every time he kills with a 
   miniature sledgehammer (a full-size one would probably be too heavy 
   for his slim frame) and a knife (which really isn't that much). The 
   film actually begins with a film within a film, as a girl on a couch 
   (Rachel Cornell) is home on a Saturday night and talking on<A HREF="sledge_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sledge 2014 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   her cellphone, while a bad puppet comes on the television screen and 
   tells us we are about to see a great film (this one; did he actually 
   watch it?). She tells her friend that the movie is about to begin and 
   not to tell her ex-boyfriend (who is at the party her girlfriend is 
   at) that he got her addicted to this show (Don't worry, she'll 
   interrupt the flow of the film several times by cutting in). The film 
   opens with a couple escorting adult retard Dickie (Tino Faygo; the 
   film's makeup artist; who thinks a bag of dog poop is candy) being 
   killed by Adam Lynch. Instead of killing Dickie, Adam tells him to 
   wipe his hands in the girl's blood and go to the police station and 
   confess to the murders (A newspaper article on screen shows us he did 
   just that). Then we get to the worst part of the film (which happens 
   to be the rest of the film): Five aggravating young adults (who you 
   want to kill yourself after listening to them talk for five minutes) 
   are on their way to a campsite, which has already been set up for 
   them since they know absolutely nothing about camping. For the next 
   30 minutes, all we hear are these idiots talking, talking, talking, 
   while the girl on the couch gets a phone call from her ex-boyfriend 
   saying he know she is watching their program and the TV puppet shows 
   a &quot;trailer&quot; for a film about Amish Murders (called &quot;THE
    AMISH PARADISE&quot;; it makes no sense at all). Once the five 
   headache-inducing adults make it to their camp (where one guy tells 
   jokes like, &quot;Did you hear about the Jewish doctor? He works for 
   tips.&quot;) and there's a three-way love/hate relationship between a 
   girl and two guys, Adam Lynch kills another couple by hitting the 
   girl in her head with a sledgehammer (all she does is spit blood into 
   her boyfriend's face; that's the extant of the makeup effects in this 
   film) and then finally goes after the five campers, killing them off 
   in quick succession without any style or suspense. As a matter of 
   fact, the Adam Lynch character is so tiny, a four year-old could 
   probably take him. Of course, the film has a &quot;surprise&quot; 
   ending, where Adam Lynch comes from the screen into real life and 
   kills the girl on the couch, while the puppet on-screen tells us to 
   stay tuned for next week for the Amish horror film.&nbsp; Every actor 
   is bad, much of the dialogue seems to have been made up on the fly 
   and Adam once again gets Dickie (How did he get out?) to take 
   responsibly for the murders we just witnessed (Dicky looks like Ron 
   Jeremy, which is the nicest thing I can say about this film). Even 
   the planned &quot;surprise&quot; outtakes during the final credits 
   are boring. The film's 75-minute running time seems to be 70 minutes 
   too long and when one girl falls down on the ground and we see her 
   heart hanging on a small branch sticking out of the ground, all you 
   can do is shake you head in shame (Believe me, it couldn't possibly 
   happen. The laws of physics make it an impossibility). Every one 
   involved in this digital film effort should hang their heads in 
   shame, because there is no story, bad sound, cameras pointed in the 
   wrong direction, simpleton gore effects (We're supposed to be scared 
   because we see a cow's intestine lying on the ground?), terrible 
   dialogue, much of it seemed improvised (if it wasn't, it just makes 
   all the &quot;actors&quot; look worse in my eyes) and no direction to 
   speak of, even though there were two of them. You'll have more fun 
   setting your socks on fire and trying to put them out in pails of 
   gasoline. That would be much less painful than sitting through this 
   piece of shit (doggy bag not included). &quot;Starring&quot; Dustin

   Oh, dear lord, not another torture porn film and this one has headache-inducing
    non-linear storytelling, too. This is the official sequel to 
   director Uwe Boll's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Seed2007">SEED</A></B> 
   (2007), and this film is also known as <B><A HREF="seed_2_2013.htm">SEED
    2</A></B>, but Boll only Presents and Executive Produces this one 
   and gets a &quot;Character Created By&quot; credit. It was 
   directed/written/co-produced by Marcel Walz, where, at the time of 
   writing this review, he has made 17 Grade Z gore flicks that never 
   have officially made it out of his native country. If this is any 
   indication on what we can expect from him in the future on the 
   international market, count me out. When a film starts off with Max 
   Seed (Nick Principe; &quot;Chrome Skull&quot; in both <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LaidToRest2009">LAID

   He was the Stunt/Fight Coordinator here) shooting a woman in her 
   vagina, you think, &quot;Can a film go any lower?&quot; Well this one 
   does. This film doesn't even try to explain how Seed is alive since 
   we saw him definitely executed in the first film and now he has a 
   family, too. The plot is simple: Four girls traveled to Las Vegas to 
   have a bachelorette party for Christine (Natalie Scheetz) and then 
   take the &quot;scenic route&quot; home in their RV and run smack-dab 
   into Max Seed and his family, which includes a woman in a State <A HREF="blood_valley_seeds_revenge_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood valley seed's revenge dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Trooper's

   Luciano), but the non-linear story, which tells what happens when 
   they run up against the family and when they are on their own 
   traveling in their RV makes no sense at all and is guaranteed to make 
   you scratch your head more than once. Let me put it this way: There 
   is some kind of biblical prophecy burned on to Christine's stomach 
   (what it is we are never told), where we see three upside-down 
   crucifixes burned into her skin and all the girls and the family die 
   one-by-one, usually at the Mother or Seed's hands. You will watch as 
   Seed crucifies one girl in the desert by pounding spikes in her hands 
   and feet with a hammer (after Mother stabs her in the stomach [and 
   sticks her finger into the wound] with a machete and son Glen cuts 
   off one of her fingers while Glen takes a photo of Mom smoking the 
   finger like a cigar. Ugh!); a good samaritan named Joe (Jeff Dylan 
   Graham) who finds her and removes the spikes (lots of gushing blood) 
   and then tries to rape her (!), but she cuts his throat with a 
   machete; Mother stabs her own son Glen with the machete and Seed 
   reaches into the wound and pulls out his intestines and strangles him 
   with them while Mother reads something from the Bible (never told why 
   he was killed); Mother shoots another girl in the knee and tells her 
   &quot;It's nothing personal&quot; (the wound mysteriously disappears 
   later in the film); Seed snaps Mother's neck for reasons unexplained; 
   Christine turns out to be Seed's daughter and they go walking off 
   into the desert holding hands with Seed still holding the crucified 
   girl's still-alive body over his shoulder; and ending with the 
   crucified girl joining the new clan as she pretends to be passed out 
   on the side of the road and slashes a good samaritan's (played by 
   Ryan Nicholson) neck when he stops his truck. Seed gives her a mask 
   and she becomes Seed Jr.! Not one second of this film makes any sense 
   and if it weren't for Ryan &amp; Megan Nicholson's excellent gore 
   effects (he's a better-known director of such films as <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#LiveFeed">LIVE
    FEED</A></B> [2006]; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Gutterballs">GUTTERBALLS</A></B>

   [2014]; and many more; Ryan passed away of brain cancer late in 2019 
   at the age of 48.), I wouldn't have paid much attention to the film, 
   especially because of the confusing non-linear storytelling. There 
   was absolutely no need for that technique here except to cover-up 
   some unshot scenes that would have been needed to make the film 
   linear. This film is so desperate, it shows the gun-up-the-vagina 
   scene twice (Where Seed tells the girl &quot;I'm your God now!&quot;) 
   and how in the world did they get Caroline Williams (<B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_2b.htm">THE
    TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE PART 2</A></B> - 1986) to do a cameo in this 
   and why exactly does she beat Christine's duct-taped intended husband 
   (Wolfgang Meyer) over and over with a hammer to his head? So many 
   questions and not one single answer. This belongs in the DTV dump 
   bins because all it offers is gore and nothing else. And I mean 
   NOTHING else. The only nudity in this film is when one of Seed's 
   unnamed female victims (Micaela Schafer) tries to crawl to the RV (It 
   looks like one of her nipples is cut off), only for Seed to grab her 
   and carry her away. This is filmmaking at its worst. It was filmed on 
   location in Nevada and also stars Christa Campbell, Annika Strauss 
   (who speaks a lot of unsubbed German here) and Sarah Hayden as 
   Christine's bridesmaids. Even though Uwe Boll's first film was also 
   pure torture porn, at least it has a stable of capable actors, unlike 
   here, where the acting is atrocious. I know I'm going to get a lot of 
   flack for saying this, but this film needed the Uwe Boll touch, 
   because it is plain to see he was just a figurehead here. Boll keeps 
   getting better and better with each film he makes (with a few 
   exceptions) and this film could have used that expertise. This is 
   nothing but pure crap without one redeemable feature besides the 
   Nicholson's special effects. But even that isn't enough for even the 
   slightest of recommendations. Just stay away and find some low-budget 
   independent films that are worth your hard-earned bucks. This is 
   definitely not one of them. If diarrhea could be turned into a film, 
   this would be the result. A <A HREF="http://www.phase4films.com">Phase

    MOTHMAN CURSE</A><A NAME="MothmanCurse2014"></A> (2014) -</B> Let me 
   start off this extremely negative review by saying this: I did not 
   pay $99.00 a year for Amazon Prime to watch streaming crap like this. 
   Yes, it was free, but free in the sense that I didn't have to pay 
   anything to watch it, not free in the sense that once I begin 
   watching a movie, I am obligated to watch the whole thing to report 
   back to my readers. And this 80-minute film is an endurance test that 
   I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. First of all, 95% of the movie is 
   in grainy black &amp; white and looks to have been filmed on 
   someone's old camera phone. You can actually see the spotlight that 
   someone is holding to illuminate scenes that were shot in the dark. 
   Secondly, the dialogue seems to have been recorded directly from the 
   phone because the futher the person is away from the camera, the lower<A HREF="mothman_curse_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mothman curse dvd front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the dialogue (I was wearing headphones and could only make out 10% of 
   the dialogue!). Thirdly, director/screenwriter/co-producer Richard 
   Mansfield (who has a film coming out in 2016 called <B><A HREF="video_killer_2016.htm">VIDEO
    KILLER</A></B>, which you can be sure I will avoid) inserts color 
   scenes as flashbacks that make no sense whatsoever. The story is so 
   simple, you could write it on the head of a pin (although Mansfield 
   tries to make it look like some art film): Two women, Katy (Katy 
   Vans) and Rachel (Rachel Dale), are hired to clean up an old 
   entertainment museum where Charlie Chaplin once lived (if you squint 
   and look sideways, you may see some of his old film posters). Somehow 
   they are being tormented by the Mothman (played by Mansfield's 
   brother David, who is also a co-producer), whom we barely glimpse. We 
   only get to see him in silhouette, staring through the window with 
   glowing eyes and a brief scene of him standing behind Rachel when she 
   lights a match. Director Mansfield also has the annoying habit of 
   looping loud screeching noises to the soundtrack to keep us awake and 
   other background noises that sound like someone dropping metal 
   objects into a 50 gallon metal drum. DO NOT be fooled by the DVD 
   cover (yes, this piece of shit actually got a DVD release!), because 
   that scene is not in the film. The fact that the cover is in color is 
   already a lie to the viewer. This film just meanders along as the two 
   English women prattle on, go to sleep (Rachel with her boyfriend 
   Darren [Darren Munn]), do very little work and the Mothman keeps 
   calling Katy on the phone asking her to let him in. That's about all 
   there is to the film. Where is the horror? Where is the curse? The 
   film just ends with no conclusion and with the shortest end credits 
   sequence I think I have ever saw (The logo for &quot;Mansfield Dark 
   Productions&quot; is a hell of a lot scarier that the entire film!). 
   Please, I beg of you, don't be fooled into watching this piece of 
   homemade trash. It was probably filmed in one day and looks it. 
   Imagine this: You take all the most boring parts of your home movies 
   and edit them into an 80-minute video movie. That would be a thousand 
   times better than watching this film. All I know is that I had an 
   extreme headache after watching it from squinting (sometimes the 
   grain is so heavy, you can't make out what is going on) and had to 
   pop an Ambien and go to sleep. If you really hate somebody and want 
   to get back at them, tape their eyelids open and make them watch this 
   stinking pile of crap. I guarantee that person will never bother you 
   again. This is the nadir of filmmaking. I'd go as far to say that 
   this is not a film at all; just a bunch of loosely connected scenes 
   to fill enough time to pass it off as a movie. I believe what this 
   &quot;film&quot; really needs is a metal garbage can, a container of 
   gasoline and a match. Do yourself a favor and watch <B><A HREF="mothman_prophecies.htm">THE

   when she takes a pregnancy test and it comes back negative, she says, 
   &quot;Thank God!&quot; Cory finds her refrigerator filled with 
   millions of dead fire ants, which freaks her out, but Evan tries to 
   keep things positive by saying, &quot;Well, at least we know how to 
   kill them!&quot; (Yes, just lure them into the refrigerator. Oh, boy, 
   my head already hurts). Olivia believes that Hamilton Lock is somehow 
   involved with the fire ant problem, but she can't prove it yet. We 
   then see Lock giving a scientific lecture on fire ants and has his 
   assistant show videos of the ants eating away at animals in a short 
   amount of time and then saying that the ants sometimes show up at car 
   accidents before the paramedics arrive. He seems to get off on 
   frightening people, so much so, that a woman in the lecture hall (Kay 
   Rogers), chastises him for being inhumane and walks out of the 
   lecture. When she leaves, Lock goes on with his lecture by saying, 
   &quot;To continue...&quot; The female protester confronts Lock in the 
   parking lot of the lecture hall and we see him escort her to the 
   passenger side of a car. The next time we see Lock, he is changing 
   clothes while humming to himself and we hear muffled screams in the 
   background, while Lock says, &quot;How we doing, Tootsie?&quot;. Lock 
   approaches the woman, who is tied-up on a chair and has duct tape 
   over her mouth. He pours a green liquid around her and within 
   seconds, she is surrounded by hordes of fire ants. We then see the 
   remain's of the woman (mainly bloody bones) in plastic pails, as he 
   puts her hat over her skull and says to her, &quot;What are you 
   looking at, you old bat?&quot;. Olivia tells Evan that Cory's bite is 
   getting bigger and that the queen ants are getting bigger (but not <B><A HREF="them_1954.htm">THEM!</A></B> 
   [1954] bigger]. Cory thinks Evan is having an affair with Olivia, but 
   Evan believes in monogamy because he wants a baby. Olivia, on the 
   other hand, would like nothing more than to be Evan's lover, so 
   Marnie takes her to Mexico for the weekend to forget about him. While 
   reaching into the clothes hamper, Cory is instantly covered in fire 
   ants and has to jump in the shower to get them off of her. She is now 
   covered head to toe in disgusting pustules and when Cory sees her, he 
   goes to get the medical kit before taking her to the hospital and 
   discovers her birth control pills. Evan becomes so enraged, he puts 
   on a headset (!) to listen to some music, while Cory is once again 
   attacked by fire ants in her bed. When Evan gets hungry and goes to 
   the refrigerator to get something to eat, he discovers Cory's dead 
   body inside the fridge. He throws up and calls the police. The police 
   and coroner determine it was a suicide (Really? They couldn't see all 
   the pustules all over her body?). Olivia believes Hamilton Lock is 
   involved in controlling the fire ants, resulting in the missing 
   people and deaths in town and he seems to be buying up a lot of 
   property at bargain prices in his missing wife's name. But why? Evan 
   and Olivia catch up to his plan (they also talk about going together 
   to see a Vincent Price double feature at the local theater, which <B><A HREF="tingler_1959.htm">THE
    TINGLER</A></B> [1959] and <B><A HREF="fly_1958.htm">THE FLY</A></B> 
   [1958] are playing), so they decide to check out one of the buildings 
   he bought. Before they are able to get out of the car, it is covered 
   with fire ants, so Evan races the car to the nearest car wash, where 
   he and Olivia make out while the car is going through the brushes. 
   (Really? After such a short period of mourning?). Olivia then breaks 
   into Lock's house to look for some proof, but a gun-carrying Lock 
   catches her. He invites Evan to come and join them and he is taken 
   prisoner, too (Really, how stupid are these two people?). They all 
   watch a VHS tape where Lock used his wife Constance (Janet Hurley 
   Kimlicki) as his first fire ant subject and we see only Lock waving 
   her skeletal hand goodbye on-screen as the tape ends. He takes Olivia 
   and Evan to a field, where they are tied together and sprayed with 
   the ant-attracting liquid. They are able to break free by using 
   Olivia's eyeglasses as a magnifying glass to burn off the ropes. They 
   rush to save Olivia's friend Marnie, who Lock says is next on his 
   list, only for all three of them to be captured by Lock again (Smart 
   enough to burn off ropes with eyeglasses, but too stupid not to keep 
   getting caught). Lock has developed a huge queen fire ant (it's the 
   size of a human hand) and he goes to use the liquid for the queen to 
   kill them, but he drops the liquid and has to let the queen go (he 
   cuddles the queen ant like someone would their pet dog!). The queen 
   flies away and Lock gets into his van, but the queen ant returns and 
   stings Lock in the eye, where he crashes the van (one of the worst 
   crashes in film history) and dies. The trio calls the police and Evan 
   and Olivia live happily ever after as if Cory never existed and the 
   tobacco-spitting local appears behind them and smiles (WTF?)&nbsp; 
   This impossibly cheap regional Texas production (Cory says she is 
   &quot;stuck here in Deliverance, Texas, surrounded by a bunch of 
   yahoos&quot;, but it was actually filmed in Bastrop, Texas) contains 
   some terrible CGI (wait until you get a gander at the queen ant!) and 
   everyone acts amateurish (If Sam Damon as Hamilton Lock had a 
   mustache, he would be twirling it) and the flat digital video 
   photography does it no favors (I've already mentioned the sound 
   problems). For a movie about killer ants, we never once see the ants 
   eat anyone (the stock footage at the lecture hall not included), only 
   the after-effects, where all we see are some bloody bones. The only 
   real thing that would even remotely considered gore in this film 
   would be the pustules on Cory's body and Lock being stung in the eye, 
   but besides a little blood in Lock's death, there no other blood in 
   the film. The film doesn't even address the fact that there's a giant 
   fire ant queen loose in the wild and the romance between Evan and 
   Olivia comes way too soon (I guess since Cory didn't take Evan's last 
   name and was taking birth control pills makes it OK in Evan's mind). 
   This is just pure laziness on director/screenwriter/co-producer 
   Carolyn Banks' part and proves that a woman can make a terrible film 
   like any man. For Christ's sake, it doesn't even try to explain why 
   Lock was buying up all the land except for a throw-away line by Lock 
   that he was buying the land to throw people off his fire ant 
   experiments (Huh? Does that make sense to anyone?). Like Olivia's 
   attraction to the rail thin Evan (really, I could count every rib 
   when he took his shirt off), just move on and find a film with more 
   meat on its bones. This film is so bad, that it has yet to find a DVD 
   distributor in the United States (although you can stream it on 
   Amazon), but there are at least two DVD releases in Germany (who will 
   release anything). Terrible, just terrible. When no company will 
   touch a film and put it on disc, you can tell that it is not worth 
   owning. Also starring Katherine Gruetzner and James R. Bryant. <B>Not Rated</B>,
    but with a few &quot;fucks&quot; in the dialogue deleted, this would 
   probably be Rated PG-13.</FONT></FONT></P>

   his filmmaking career (the funding for his latest film had just 
   fallen through and that, along with his real-life problems, just made 
   him snap [something I definitely understand] and take his own life). 
   Apparently Andy was some sort of &quot;prodigy&quot; to this film's 
   director/screenwriter/editor/cinematographer Henrique Couto (<B><A HREF="scarewaves_2014.htm">SCAREWAVES</A></B>

   town of Ray Falls, Ohio, a psychopath kidnaps a babysitter named 
   April after being taunted by text messages on her cell phone (I'm not 
   on the house...yet!&quot;) on Halloween Night. She is taking a bath 
   (total nudity, but she is chunky) and the doorbell rings and when he 
   answers the door (with her tits hanging out from the towel!), the 
   killer, wearing a white fetish mask and white gloves, grabs her and 
   then we see her tied naked to a chair. while the killer pulls out a 
   couple of her fingernails and then slits her throat, documenting the 
   whole thing on April's cell phone camera. In the present day, April's 
   father Mr. Walker<A HREF="babysitter_massacre_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/babysitter massacre poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="353" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (Geoff Burkman) gets a letter in the mail declaring April legally 
   dead (her body was never found) due to &quot;death by absentia&quot; 
   by the police force. Mr. Walker says to Angela (Erin R. Ryan; a 
   regular cast member of Couto's shorts and films) that it stings 
   seeing it in letter form. No more police reports. No more insurance 
   investigations looking for fraud. The only comfort he has had in the 
   past seven years was watching next-door neighbor Angela grow up to 
   become a caring young woman. It is Halloween Day once again and 
   Angela plans on having a few friends over that night for a slumber 
   party (Oh, boy!). We then watch a totally naked Angela (who could use 
   something to eat) take a shower (just like we saw the chunky April 
   take a full-frontal bath before she bit it) when a multi-pierced 
   Bianca (Marylee Osborne) scares the shit out of her. Bianca was the 
   person who was supposed to be April's buddy at the &quot;Babysitting 
   Club&quot;, which all the girls belonged to, but she let April go out 
   on her own (She tells Angela, &quot;Survivor's guilt is such a 
   bitch!&quot;) and, besides Angela, all the other girls that belonged 
   to the club haven't talked to her in seven years. Angela invites 
   Bianca to come to the slumber party tonight, but make sure she comes 
   a couple of hours late, so the girls are nice and drunk (Anyone ever 
   hear of an &quot;angry drunk&quot;? Perfect plan Angela!). Now that 
   we have the set-up, let the (off-screen) bloodletting begin. One girl 
   calls up Angela and says she may not show up at the slumber party. 
   She is chased through the woods by the same white-masked and gloved 
   killer (This is the type of film that no matter how fast the victim 
   runs, the slow-walking killer always catches up). The killer first 
   hits the girl in one of her palms with a hand axe and then chops her 
   over and over with it, her blood splattering against a tree (This is 
   also the type of film where we hardly see the actual murders, only 
   the after-effects. He also spray-paints a red &quot;X&quot; across 
   her body, but does it to none of his other victims, probably because 
   she was marking a trail in the woods with a red &quot;X&quot; on 
   trees.). He then uses the victim's camera phone to send pictures to 
   April, who thinks it is the girl's Halloween costume! (By now, if you 
   haven't guessed who the killer is, you are either not watching the 
   film or are sleepy). Linda (Odette Despairr) and boyfriend Tony 
   (David DeNoyer) are discussing whether she should jump in the frigid 
   water of her pool. She comes back inside and says that Tony was 
   correct and she sees the killer, but thinks it is Tony's Halloween 
   costume. She goes upstairs to change and sees Tony's dead body and 
   the killer kidnaps her. She is sitting in a dark room illuminated by 
   one spotlight, where we see (or rather, don't see) the killer slice 
   her tongue with a strait-razor, cut off her ear (all we see is her 
   ear fall to the floor) and then slits her throat (shown as drops of 
   blood hitting the floor). He then takes a photo of Linda and sends it 
   to Angela, who thinks the same thing as before (Two girls with slit 
   throats? Time to rethink your thought-process, Angela!). Angela and 
   her mother (Amy Diederich) have a heart-to-heart (which is hard to 
   take seriously when her Mom is dressed in a see-through outfit, 
   dressed as a cougar [or if you rather, a MILF], going to an adult 
   party!). Mom and Angela have a sickly sweet discussion on how Mr. 
   Walker just won't let the death of his daughter go (Mom has these 
   words of wisdom, which will come to bite her in the ass: &quot;Sadness
    is like a brace or a crutch. It's a coward's way out.&quot;). Mom 
   leaves the house just as the first girl, Lucky (Jonie Durian), shows 
   up at the slumber party. Bianca tries to have a talk with former 
   Babysitter Club member Sandra (Serendipity Lynch) when she is about 
   to leave work, but Sandra says some unfair and hurtful things to 
   Bianca and she leaves. Sandra sees her boss murdered by the masked 
   killer and then he comes after her. She hides under a desk but the 
   killer stops her from sending a text with her phone and sends Angela 
   a photo of a dead Sandra instead. Arlene (Tara Clark) then joins the 
   slumber party and then there's a knock on the door. At the doorstep 
   is a box full of sexy lingerie, so these three stupid girls put them 
   on (Arlene is the only female in the film that has sexy breasts). 
   Meanwhile, the killer is in the room of a fat prostitute, so she 
   strips naked (My eyes! My eyes!) and starts eating candy in front of 
   him! For her &quot;surprise&quot;, he stabs her in her flabby stomach 
   with scissors (again not shown). Bianca use to be the girlfriend of 
   Tyler (Marshall Norman), who is still a pizza delivery guy (what 
   would a film like this be without a pizza delivery guy?) and she 
   wants him to drive her to Angela's house to check up on her (This is 
   after we see the killer murder another girl by pouring boiling water 
   on her face and then getting stabbed in the back of the head where 
   nothing is shown except the after-effects. And then he murders all 
   the people in one of the poorest-looking Halloween parties on film 
   history and kills Angela's mother after she puts on a rubber mask to 
   scare the now-dead crowd [all of it off-screen].) The killer then 
   maces another girl in the eyes who has her mouth duct-taped (one of 
   the most popular tools in every killer's toolbox). It must be 
   something worse than mace because she dies while puke comes seeping 
   through the duct tape on her mouth. Bianca knocks on the door, but no 
   one seems to be home, probably because the killer has chloroformed 
   all three of them and taken them down to the basement. Lucky is tied 
   to a chair and says the only way the other two will be let go is if 
   one of them kills her with the claw hammer on the floor. Arlene seems 
   a little too into it, as she whacks Lucky in the head a few times and 
   then plants the claw end on the hammer into her chest [off-screen], 
   killing her. Oh, and if you haven't guessed by now, Mr. Walker is the 
   killer (although it is plain to see that the killer is played by a 
   much younger person [actually three!]). He strangles Arlene and then 
   cuts Angela's Achilles heels and pours gasoline on the floor so she 
   can't get away. Why did he kill his own daughter seven years ago? 
   Because he loved Angela more! (One of the worst explanations I have 
   ever heard!). Angela stabs Mr. Walker and Bianca has a chance to 
   rescue Angela, but Mr. Walker lights his Bic and the house burns to 
   the ground. Once again, Bianca fails to save a friend. And luckier 
   for us, the film ends.&nbsp; It's apparent Henrique Couto watched 
   films like <B><A HREF="slumber_party_massacre_1982.htm">THE SLUMBER 
   PARTY MASSACRE</A></B> (1982) and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SororityHouseMassac">SORORITY

    HOUSE MASSACRE 2</A></B> [1990] gets name-checked here) and there's 
   not one cliche that he missed, but what he did forget was showing the 
   killer actually doing the <I>killing</I>, not just showing us the 
   results of his kills, which is very aggravating for the viewer. This 
   is a very long 78 minutes and the film is boring and stupid. The one 
   way you can tell is that you watch the clock more than the film 
   itself. The stench I smelled wasn't coming from my Roku 3 player 
   overheating (I saw this film for free since I am an Amazom Prime 
   member), it was coming from the film itself. Only Arlene's breasts 
   are worth looking at and this is a very bad tribute to Andy Copp, who 
   could have done better with his eyes closed than Henrique Couto did 
   with them wide open. Dustin Mills, the director of the excellent <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Skinless2013">SKINLESS</A></B>

   some hard turd that has been stuck in your asshole for three days. 
   but won't come out. No sooner than I wrote this, some of the world's 
   oldest high schoolers are attending a Halloween party where a live 
   punk band called &quot;The Poots&quot; are playing a song called 
   &quot;Poops on you&quot;. Am I psychic or not? The basic storyline is 
   this: Joseph (Bill Heintz), whose sister was slaughtered two months 
   earlier by notorious serial killer Richard Cork (J.C. Pennington), 
   who cut her to pieces and arranged her body parts into some type of 
   art project) is at the Halloween party and tells the legend of 
   &quot;The Three Legged Lady&quot;, where a wife finds her husband 
   screwing a small-breasted naked woman in a barn, chops him up in 
   pieces with a machete and then chases the naked girl and kills her, <A HREF="stabbed_in_the_face_2004.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stabbed in the face dvd front8a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>too
    (most of it off-screen). The police show up and shoot the wife dead 
   at the entrance to the barn. Joseph says he knows where this happened 
   and that the ghost of &quot;The Three Legged Lady&quot; only reveals 
   herself during Halloween, which is tomorrow. He talks all his friends 
   to go with him to the location tomorrow (which is unbelievable beyond 
   belief since his sister was murdered just a short while ago). I know 
   none of this makes any sense, especially since we never see a Three 
   Legged Lady, but just go along with it for now. As everyone is headed 
   for the death barn, Richard Cork escapes from prison and you'll never 
   guess where he and his female captive are hiding. That's right, the 
   are at the death barn (we see Cork cut off the nipple of his female 
   captive, the film's best effect. Most of the other bloody effects 
   could be done by an overaged high schooler).&nbsp; This shot-on-video 
   abomination has some of the worst acting, headache-inducing music 
   (usually done by The Poots) and special effects I have ever seen in a 
   no-budget film. The twenty-ish teens smoke dope, have sex (there is 
   more nudity by the female cast than normal in films like this) and 
   the girls talk more about having sex than the guys do. The guys are 
   more interested in getting high or drunk. It becomes apparent after a 
   short while that there are actually two killers at large and I bet 
   you know who the second one is. Director &amp; co-producer Jason 
   Matherne (<B><A HREF="attack_of_the_cockface_killer_2002.htm">ATTACK

   so it could be sold on Amazon) telegraphs that Joseph has become 
   psychotic since his sister was killed and he kills nearly as many of 
   his friends as Cork does. There's death by pitchfork, a knife in the 
   eye and the slicing open of a stoner's stomach until he holds his own 
   intestines, but very little stabbing in the face, all done rather 
   poorly. The editing, by Steve Waltz, who has a major role as Bruce in 
   the film and does the stupidest thing possible when his girlfriend 
   Madelyn (Dana Kieferle) is killed by Cork is very confusing and some 
   scenes make no sense (especially the ending). Joseph dresses much in 
   the same way as the real-life (and unsolved) serial killer The Zodiac 
   reportedly did and he shoots Cork, but it doesn't seem to affect him. 
   If Joseph killed his sister and Richard Cork is just in his 
   imagination, the editing does this film no favors. Screenwriter &amp; 
   co-producer Jared Scallions (who appears here as Mark, the only high 
   schooler with a beer belly!) gives the cast of actors some 
   unbelievable dialogue (If girls I knew were so interested in sex as 
   much as these girls are, I would have never left high school), such 
   as when Madelyn says to Bruce, &quot;You put the 'dick' in 
   ridiculous!&quot; There is also a lot of horror film name-dropping 
   such as <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY THE 13TH</A></B>

   females (including Sarah). He marries the couple and then tries to 
   force himself on Trish at the<A HREF="cabin_fear_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cabin fear poster12 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="353" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   reception, but Carter catches him and punches him in the face a few 
   times. Jay goes into the woods to get away from him, only there's a 
   much bigger threat out there: A hooded killer, who pins Jay's hand to 
   a tree with a crossbow bolt when he is taking a leak. The killer 
   chases Jay and he hides behind a tree (Jay rips his hand off the 
   crossbow bolt in the tree), only to be shot in the crotch with the 
   crossbow, the killer twisting the bolt while blood spurts into the 
   air (talk about a climax!). The question becomes, who is the killer 
   and what are his/her motive? Since the list of suspects is small, 
   including cabin caretaker, the grizzled old-timer Walter Clayton 
   (Ralph Cashen), you would think you already know the answer, but you 
   would be wrong (I guessed who the killer was as soon as Dani was 
   invited). Grant, Dani and Walter go looking for Jay in the woods, 
   only for Grant to lose both of his searchmates (red herring alert!). 
   At the same time Grant loses sight of both Walter and Dani, the 
   killer strikes at the cabin, slicing Trish's throat with a butcher 
   knife while she is taking a shower. Carter can't find Trish (the 
   shower is now clean and empty), so he goes out to Walter's cabin, 
   where we see a crossbow, but no Walter (Previously, Walter calls 
   Carter, who is black, a &quot;boy&quot;, and it is apparent he 
   doesn't approve of interracial couples). The electricity goes out in 
   the cabin, so Beth goes down in the basement to check out the fuse 
   box. She get the electricity to work again. When the lights go out 
   again, Beth does the same thing, only this time she sees Dani's 
   corpse next to the fusebox (a cockroach comes crawling out of her 
   mouth) and has Sarah (who faints at the sight of blood) join her in 
   the basement. Meanwhile, Grant finally reunites with Walter (who says 
   he twisted his ankle) and Dani in the woods and they return to the 
   cabin., to find that there is no one there. Jay has gone out to the 
   woods to search for Trish and the girls are in the basement (which 
   looks more like a mineshaft). Carter returns in the middle of the 
   night and everyone tells him about Trish. He goes down in the 
   basement and brings her corpse upstairs, where he blames Walter for 
   killing her. He goes running back to Walter's cabin and discovers 
   Jay's body which is encased in Saran wrap, but Walter is nowhere to 
   be found. Carter returns to the cabin and has a heart to heart talk 
   with Grant where he tells Grant that Trish has cheated on him before 
   (What?!?!?!) and, as sad music plays on the soundtrack, we discover 
   that Carter was going to propose to Trish (What!?!?!). He pulls out a 
   ring that he was going to give his girlfriend that weekend. Beth goes 
   mental and threatens everyone with a baseball bat. She locks herself 
   in her bedroom and takes her insulin shot (Beth is a diabetic). As 
   soon as she injects herself, it is plain to see that it wasn't 
   insulin in the syringe. Beth begins to twitch wildy, foams at her 
   mouth and dies. The lists of suspects are now growing smaller (you 
   would have to be a total idiot not to know who it is, as it tries too 
   hard to pin Dani as the killer). Everyone decides to get in one of 
   the cars and drive away, but the car won't start and the tires are 
   flat. Carter lifts the hood of the car and finds Walter's decapitated 
   head lodged in the engine. Carter says he can take the tires off his 
   car (his car overheated on the trip to the cabin) and put them on the 
   other car, so he uses a jack to lift up the other car. As we expect 
   the car to drop on Carter, it does, but the car does not touch 
   Carter. Instead, he has his left arm chopped off by the killer, who 
   nows has an axe. Grant is caught kissing Dani by Sarah and she runs 
   out of the cabin. Grant goes searching for her. Sarah comes back to 
   the cabin and gets into a fight to the death with Dani. All the while 
   we are led to believe that Dani is the hooded killer (The film tries 
   hard to make her look like the culprit. Maybe a little too hard.), 
   but when Grant comes back and finds Dani on top of Sarah on the 
   floor, he becomes enraged and throws Dani off of her, where Dani is 
   impaled in the head with a shelf bracket. We then discover that Sarah 
   was the killer all the time (we see her fondling a necklace that 
   Walter wore and said he would never take it off because it was the 
   only thing that reminded him of his dead wife. What good is a 
   necklace if you no longer have a head?). Sarah gets away with it and 
   Grant doesn't have a clue that he married a psychopath.&nbsp; This is 
   boredom taken to the 10th degree, even though there is plenty of 
   nudity and some gory practical effects. Director Joe Bandelli (<B><A HREF="getting_wet_2011.htm">GETTING
    WET</A></B> - 2011) doesn't miss one slasher film clich&eacute;, 
   from no cellphone service in the woods to trying its best to make 
   someone else look like the killer. I knew it was Sarah when she 
   welcomed Dani to come to the wedding. Who in the hell wants an 
   ex-girlfriend of the groom at her nuptials? The characters are 
   cartoon stereotypes, who always do the worst things at the most 
   inopportune times. If you are going to make a slasher film today, it 
   better have a hook to hold your interest. This film's hook is 
   boredom. 92 minutes of it. Only for people who have to watch every

   (2016) -</B> Simply terrible horror/comedy about a hulking, sexually 
   repressed, and indestructable, serial killer nicknamed Bonejangles 
   (screenwriter Keith Melcher), whose real name is Edgar Friendly Jr. 
   He is sexually repressed because his father, Edgar Friendly Sr. 
   (Reggie Bannister in nothing but a glorified cameo), told his son 
   that all women are evil and makes it clear to him by saying, 
   &quot;Protect your wee winkie!&quot; (Really?). We first meet 
   Bonejangles in a warehouse where he kills a warehouse worker (who is 
   reading a nudie magazine called &quot;Melons&quot;) by shoving the 
   rolled-up magazine in his mouth and chopping off his leg with an axe. 
   He takes a bone from the leg and attaches it to his pants (His 
   trademark is the sound of clanking bones). We then meet two fuck-up 
   cops, Doug (Kelly Misek Jr.) and Randy (Jamie Scott Gordon), who are 
   sitting on a curb talking about sex and we realize that Randy is a 
   virgin. The Captain shows up, so he tells the two screw-ups that 
   Bonejangles is trapped in a warehouse and they are to go into the 
   building and try to&nbsp; capture him. Knowing that he is impervious 
   to bullets, The Captain gives them tasers (Really?) to stop the 
   hulking giant. Bonejangles takes out most of the town's police 
   officers before Randy and Doug run into him. Not knowing what to do 
   and facing imminent death, they hold each other like little scardy 
   cats before fellow female officer Lisa (Hannah Richter) disables 
   Bonejangles with a taser to his chest (low-rent optical effects). Now 
   heavily sedated, Bonejangles is in custody, but the Mayor doesn't 
   want him in his town, so Doug, Randy, Lisa and new recruit, the 
   flamboyant, hoop earring-wearing, Juan (Lawrence Wayne Curry, who 
   looks like a gay Eddie Murphy) are to transport Bojangles to the town 
   of Argento (Really?), where they will hand him over to the State 
   Police for transport to Smith Grove Sanitarium. Doug was born in 
   Argento and hasn't been there in ten years and for good reason. It 
   seems that the town is cursed. Every April 18th, the dead rise from 
   their grave and the zombies chow down on any person they can find, 
   thanks to a witch named Rowena <A HREF="bonejangles_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bonejangles 2016 poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="355" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(Elissa
    Dowling; <B><A HREF="dont_kill_it_2016.htm">DON'T KILL IT</A></B> - 
   2016), who was burned at the stake on that date in the late 1700's 
   for having sexual pleasure with the devil. Every April 18th, the 
   townspeople gather in the high school gymnasium and wait for the next 
   day to avoid the zombies. Guess what day today is? (Doug knew all 
   this, yet he fails to tell anyone until they are in town!). Once in 
   Argento, Doug, Randy and Lisa are attacked by zombies, so they shoot 
   them in the head (off screen). Juan gets frightened and takes off 
   with Bonejangles in back of the paddy wagon (He has an IV in his arm 
   that feeds him a huge dose of tranquilizers) and, while trying to 
   avoid a zombie, he crashes the vehicle and the IV comes out of 
   Bonejangles' arm. Juan gets out and spots a line of Twinkies on the 
   ground (Really?) so he picks them up and runs into two hillbillies. 
   Rather than being frightened, he smiles a shit-eating grin. 
   Meanwhile, Bonejangles escapes and begins to slaughter a bunch of 
   campers in the woods (it makes no sense since everyone nearby knows 
   about the curse). Doug and Lisa lose Randy and he will be Rowena's 
   next &quot;juice lad&quot;. Rowena stays eternally young by making 
   love to virgins, sucking all of the life juice out of them and 
   eventually disposing of them when they become a husk of their former 
   selves. Doug and Lisa make it the the gymnasium, where Doug finds out 
   his high school love, Sally (Julia Cavanaugh) is about to marry high 
   school bully Clint (Devin Toft). The sight of Doug instantly brings 
   back romantic memories to the both of them, so the preacher calls for 
   a thirty minute break before he performs the ceremony (Really?). Doug 
   and Sally re-ignite their former love for each other and Clint makes 
   love to Lisa (Really?). Lisa is killed when she taunts Bonejangles to 
   follow her. She strips naked and takes a shower in front of him, 
   knowing that he is sexually repressed (Really?). Bonejangles stabs 
   her in the stomach with a machete after having flashbacks where his 
   father once again says &quot;Protect your wee winkie!&quot;. Clint 
   gets his hand cut off by Bonejangles with the same machete (a 
   horrible effect) while Doug gets the idea of using the 
   indestructable&nbsp; serial killer as a way to kill Rowena and 
   lifting the curse off of the town for good. In a bit that will remind 
   you of <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">THE EVIL DEAD</A></B> (1983), 
   Clint attaches a chainsaw to his handless arm (after sealing his 
   wound with electricity), but when he starts the chainsaw, he cuts his 
   own head in two! (The only scene that made me laugh). The rushed 
   ending has Bonejangles showing up and killing Rowena with a machete 
   to her chest, while Doug and Sally save Randy (who has made love to 
   Rowena just one time). THE END (Really?). This is a total amateur 
   production from frame one.&nbsp; The makeup effects reek (Clint's 
   head cleaving is partially done by obvious lousy GCI) and the acting 
   can politely be called atrocious. But the worse thing that totally 
   took me out of the film were the gunshots. Instead of sounding like 
   gunshots, they sounded like cap pistols. I'm sorry, but a little more 
   care could have been taken in the looping process for the proper 
   sound effects. I mean, how hard could it be to use actual gun shot 
   sound effects to the film? I could download it off the internet. And 
   the character of Juan sets back gay rights by 50 years. At the finale 
   of the film, Juan shows up in a pickup with the two hillbillies and 
   tells Doug and Randy that he is going to stay, with one of the 
   hillbillies saying, &quot;I'll make you squeal like a pig!&quot; The 
   satisfied look on Juan's face will make you say &quot;Really?&quot; 
   Director Brett DeJager (<B><A HREF="legend_of_cooley_moon_2012.htm">THE
    LEGEND OF COOLEY MOON</A></B> - 2012), who obviously blew his budget 
   on smoke machines (nearly every scene has &quot;fog&quot; in it, even 
   the indoor shots!), has no idea on how to pace a film. Scenes just 
   appear with no connective tissue between the last sequence and the 
   present one. The rushed ending doesn't answer many of the questions 
   that this film brings up, like why is Bonejangles indestructable, yet 
   he is able to be brought down by a mere taser? Does being a 
   misogynist make you invunerable to bullets? Why does the sergeant 
   send his worst two fuckups to hand over the worst serial killer in 
   the town's history? (I know Bonejangles decimated most of the town's 
   police officers, but sending Juan, who would never even be considered 
   being made a police officer, along for the ride is beyond the pale). 
   The feeble attempts at humor, including the flashback Doug has where 
   Clint and him are in high school (He keep getting hit in the head 
   with a basketball while Clint yells out &quot;Heads up 
   dingleberry!&quot;, even in situations where tossing a basketball is 
   impossible), are beyond not funny. They induce groans rather than 
   yucks. Even Reggie Bannister, who has no more than five minutes of 
   screen time, looks embarrassed appearing in drivel such as this, yet 
   he gets top billing. I'm growing really tired of watching films like 
   this based on the poster alone. It is obvious that more care was 
   spent on poster art rather than the film itself. Stay away if you 
   value your sanity. Thank God it is only 78 minutes long! Also 
   starring Christopher Hunt, Katie Walgrave, Allen Regimbal, Ben Gersch

   chalkboard sound pleasant!) and DeJager as &quot;Wes&quot;. Filmed in

   is rubbing the crucifix between her fingers, Carol (Joanna Bryant)

    Shit, I can't go on. This &quot;film&quot; is so insufferable, I was 
   tempted to turn it off and throw the DVD into the microwave (but I 
   always watch the entire movie no matter how bad it is. It's a curse, 
   not a gift.). For one thing, it is shot on video (SOV). It is also 
   impossibly cheap-looking and the &quot;acting&quot; is abysmal. The 
   awful music suddenly gets very loud, drowning out the dialogue (Their 
   British accents are so thick and the sound is recorded so low, I had 
   to use the optional English subtitles to make out what they were 
   saying). It is also edited with a trowel, as scenes just pop-up 
   without any connective tissue. The source print used for the DVD has 
   rollouts and static. It's like watching a prerecorded VHS tape 
   encoded in the EP Mode, where the VCR tries to properly track the 
   tape, but fails. I don't know whether Intervision did this on purpose 
   or not, but it is very annoying. I can't believe people back in the 
   day thought that this was real. It is total amateur hour (well, it is 
   a looooong 76 minutes). Even your home videos are better acted than 
   what we see in this film. It doesn't surprise me that 
   director/co-producer Alan Briggs or his wife, screenwriter Meg Shanks 
   never made anything else (Meg Shanks ran a Drama School for children 
   and most of her students appeared in this film. No wonder why her 
   school never turned out anyone famous!). It's quite awful, making the 
   SOV films <B><A HREF="#Boarding House">BOARDING HOUSE</A></B> (1982) 
   and <B><A HREF="#Sledgehammer">SLEDGEHAMMER</A></B> (1984; also an 
   Intervision title) look professional in comparison. The special 
   effects are also lousy. When Elizabeth moves a desk with her 
   supernatural powers, you can see a man on all fours moving it with 
   his back! When Elizabeth makes a potted plant and a pencil levitate, 
   you can see the strings holding them. The makeup effects, while 
   bloody, look to have been done by a grade schooler (check out Carol 
   stabbing herself in the leg). In the finale, when the kids go on a 
   murder spree while under Elizabeth's powers, slaughtering all the 
   adults with knives, it elicits laughter rather than fear (mainly for 
   the cheap way it is done; especially when a knife blade enters the 
   back of Maurice's head and exits out of his mouth). Oh, and did I 
   mention Jesus makes an appearance during the finale to defeat a 
   Devil-possessed Elizabeth? The extras on the DVD includes a trailer 
   and an interview with director Alan Briggs, who speaks of this film 
   like it is the <B>CITIZEN KANE</B> of do-it-yourself films. There is 
   also an interview with fanzine creator John Martin, who gives us a 
   history of this film and the controversy it caused with the British 
   censors. It's the best part of the disc. The opening and closing 
   credits look as if they were done on a Commodore 64, as the typeface 
   looks like something you would find on a dot matrix printer (remember 
   them?) and, during the closing credits, they credit films like <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B>

   Another PG-13 piece of shit from producer Jason Blum and his 
   BlumHouse Production outfit. It was also released by the 
   legally-troubled Weinstein Brothers' Dimension Films, who held the 
   film for over two years before it got a limited theatrical/VOD 
   release and then was immediately dumped on home video. It's easy to 
   see why. Forty years after Ronald DeFeo murdered six family members 
   at the house in Amityville, a new family moves in: Mother Joan 
   (Jennifer Jason Leigh; <B><A HREF="eyes_of_a_stranger_1981.htm">EYES 
   OF A STRANGER</A></B> - 1981), young daughter Juliet (Mckenna Grace), 
   rebellious goth daughter Belle (singer Bella Thorne) and her comatose 
   twin brother James (Cameron Monaghan; <B><A HREF="giver_2014.htm">THE GIVER</A></B> 
   - 2014). James is brain-dead and has been in a coma for over two 
   years since he fought a man who plastered naked photos of Belle all 
   over the internet and was pushed off a third floor balcony. I know 
   what you are thinking and you are absolutely <A HREF="amityville_the_awakening_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/amityville the awakening poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>correct.
    Mom purposely moved into this house so James could come back to life 
   (She says to Belle: &quot;God gave up on us so I gave up on 
   God!&quot;). That is what is wrong with this film. It is a 
   by-the-numbers horror flick. Everything you think is going to happen 
   does happen, thereby giving audiences no surprises. I don't think I 
   have ever seen Jennifer Jason Leigh act so amateurishly. It's like 
   she knew she signed on for a loser of a film. The breaking point 
   comes when new school friend Terrence (Thomas Mann; <B><A HREF="blood_father_2015.htm">BLOOD
    FATHER</A></B> - 2015) tries to tell Belle (Who wears black 
   lipstick, wears too much mascara and dresses in tight black clothing. 
   Isn't goth dead?) about the history of the house and when Belle says 
   doesn't know anything about it (Really???), Terrence pulls out the 
   MGM DVD of the original <B><A HREF="amityville_horror_1979.htm">AMITYVILLE
    HORROR</A></B> (1979) and says they should watch it at her house at 
   3:15 AM, the same time as when Ronald DeFeo murdered his family 40 
   years earlier! And she agrees!!!! (They don't watch the <A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#AmityvilleHorror05">2005
    remake</A> because &quot;Remakes suck.&quot; So do Amityville 
   franchises!). All this film has to offer are jump scares and very 
   little else. One major problem I had with this film was James' 
   comatose body. It is so atrophied and thin (you can count every one 
   of his ribs), it is unbelievable. All coma patients go through daily 
   rehabilitation so their joints don't get stiff, but not in this film. 
   It's hard to believe James is still alive (and his bedroom is 
   directly above the basement chamber that James Brolin discovered!), 
   so when he does come to life, possessed by the evil of the house (the 
   film doesn't even bother to tell us who is possessing James), it 
   comes as no surprise that his body miraculously transforms into that 
   of a healthy teen, who grabs a shotgun and goes searching for his 
   family members in the house (a direct steal from <A HREF="amityville_2_the_possession_1982.htm"><B>AMITYVILLE
    II: THE POSSESSION</B></A> - 1981). It's hard to believe this came 
   from director/screenwriter Franck Khalfoun, who gave us the really 
   good remake of <B><A HREF="maniac_2012.htm">MANIAC</A></B> (2012). He 
   shows us none of that film's inventiveness here, just basic horror 
   cliches. There are too many loose ends, as plot points are brought up 
   and never elaborated on, especially Dr. Milton (Kurtwood Smith; <B><A HREF="robocop_1987.htm">ROBOCOP</A></B> 
   - 1987), James' doctor. Not only should he have is medical license 
   pulled because of the condition of James' body, but when he turns 
   James' body to the side, he discovers his back is full of maggots and 
   flies, which fly into his mouth (a cheap and unconvincing CGI 
   effect). He then disappears from the film and we never learn what 
   happens to him. We also never see what happens to the family's German 
   shepard, Larry, as Juliet simply finds him floating in the lake (That 
   will teach them for naming him Larry!). That is what I hate about 
   PG-13 movies; we are supposed to imagine the deaths without actually 
   seeing them. This film is the blueprint on what is wrong with PG-13

    The film opens on the morning after Halloween, where black drug 
   dealer Duke (Edward Williams, who sends Civil Rights back a hundred 
   years with his performance) wakes up completely naked in a bathroom, 
   stepping on glass from a bottle he has just broken. He hobbles into 
   the next room, where his friend Jacopo (Gabriele Rossi, who plays his 
   role as a man who has done way too many drugs, slurring his words and 
   rarely opening his eyes more than a squint. Maybe he isn't acting!) 
   is screwing Lenka (Carlotta Morelli), screaming at them to stop 
   fucking and get him some antiseptic for his foot. Jacopo tells him to 
   chill out and when they look up at a roof window, they see a naked 
   woman lying there. Duke and Jacopo are so wasted, they break the 
   window with a ladder and the naked woman falls to the floor, dead, 
   her throat cut from ear to ear. Lenka tells them it is her friend 
   Elizabeth (Noemi Smorra), but none of them can remember what happened 
   the night before because they were so wasted. Duke then gets an 
   emergency phone call, so he and Jacopo leave the apartment (!). We 
   then discover the &quot;emergency&quot; is a drug buy for one of 
   Duke's customers (a goth man and his male goth friends), but he 
   doesn't have any money, so Duke hits him over the head with a beer 
   bottle (!) while Jacopo rifles through his wallet, taking 100 Euros 
   and the coke and pills inside it (Jacopo<A HREF="ballad_in_blood_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ballad in blood amazon prime poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   swallows the pills without asking what they are, but he's a 
   &quot;good&quot; drug addict who doesn't like coke!). They return 
   back to Lenka's apartment and discover her taking a bath...with 
   Elizabeth's dead body! They must discover who killed Elizabeth since 
   they were all too zonked out the night before (one of them could be 
   the murderer).&nbsp; Duke wants Jacopo to cut up Elizabeth's body 
   into pieces, but he refuses, so Duke plants the knife in Elizabeth's leg!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Since both Lenka and Elizabeth are students in Rome as part of the 
   Erasmus Project (Google it), Elizabeth was recording her life for her 
   mother back home, using her phone as a camera on a selfie stick. She 
   may have recorded her own murder, but her phone is nowhere to be 
   found in the apartment. Lenka then gets a phone call from one of 
   Elizabeth's friends, who tells her that Elizabeth left her phone at 
   her apartment the night before. She tells Lenka that she was watching 
   some of her footage, asking Lenka who the person is in the skeleton 
   costume. He is in most of the footage with her and Elizabeth. Lenka 
   can't remember and tells her she will be right over to get the 
   phone.&nbsp; For some reason, Duke and Jacopo think it is 
   prudent&nbsp; to kill Elizabeth's friend, so they wait outside while 
   Lenka goes to retrieve the phone and bring Elizabeth's friend outside 
   (Jacopo does the coke he stole from the wallet and then complains 
   that coke dries out his nose!). Unfortunately, the plan doesn't go 
   off as they think it will, as the friend is taken away by her angry 
   boyfriend and Lenka comes outside to be accosted by an old woman. 
   Duke and Jacopo grab the old woman and throw her off a bridge before 
   Lenka can tell them it isn't Elizabeth's friend. When Lenka tells 
   them they killed the wrong person, they all have a good laugh!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I wanted to stop watching this film after this scene (Hell, I really 
   wanted to stop watching after the first five minutes!), but once I 
   start watching a film, no matter how bad it is, I always finish it, 
   if only for you, dear reader. To explain how awful this film really 
   is, let me give you a synopsis about the rest of the fim: Duke finds 
   the knife that killed Elizabeth hidden under Lenka's bed and the trio 
   begin to blame each other for Elizabeth's death. Then, out of 
   nowhere, Duke says he is hungry, opens the refrigerator and screams 
   at Lenka for not having any food in the house! Duke sends Jacopo out 
   of the apartment to get rid of the knife and then Duke begins 
   laughing his head off at a pornographic cartoon he is watching on TV 
   (About a walking penis trying to find a vagina to enter!), while 
   Lenka does a striptease in front of him! A minute later, Lenka is 
   slapping the shit out of Duke's face and tries to break a full bottle 
   of J&amp;B Scotch over his head. Duke opens the refrigerator once 
   again and screams that there is no food in the apartment. There is a 
   character in this film, diminutive bartender Leo (Ernesto Mahieux), 
   who is only in this film because he is short in stature (4' 11&quot;),
    as his dialogue, where he demands &quot;rent&quot; from Duke and 
   Jacopo makes no sense at all, only put in the film to cover the fact 
   that nothing in this film makes any sense at all. Duke and Jacopo 
   then stab each other to death with the knife he was supposed to get 
   rid of. The film ends with Lenka dancing a ballet around all the dead 
   bodies and then Leo and his obviously gay lover lead Lenka out of her 
   apartment and they walk hand in hand down a fog-shrouded street. 
   WTF?!? I give up!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Deodato paints Rome as a city of decadence, where the streets are 
   littered with drunks or drugged-out young people lying in alleyways 
   or making love in front of everyone. This would have worked if the 
   story weren't so bereft of logic. Give Deodato points for trying to 
   get our minds off the story by giving us plenty of full-frontal 
   nudity (both female and male) and tossing in some graphic violence 
   (especially towards the finale), but nudity and violence without a 
   story does not make a good film. Far from it, this film is a 
   travesty. Screw Deodato for unleashing this turgid piece of crap and 
   then trying to get us to believe it all means something. He should 
   have quit directing after <B><A HREF="washing_machine_1993.htm">THE

    Obviously filmed in English, this film never received a physical 
   home video release in the United States (at the time of this review) 
   for reasons that are very clear.&nbsp; No company, at least no good 
   company, would dare to release it on DVD or Blu-Ray and expect to 
   make a profit (It was released in both formats in Germany, but in 
   severely edited form). If you really must watch this (and I don't 
   have the faintest idea why you would), Amazon Prime offers it 
   streaming, uncut in a nice anamorphic widescreen print, free to Prime 
   members. If I must say something good about this film, it is this: It 
   is professionally shot with a distinct editorial style, but it is 
   still too little too late. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   with his faithful dog. So how does this possessed group pay thanks to 
   the blind priest? By moving the furniture around, so he falls flat on 
   his face, as they have a good laugh about it! And how do we know 
   something evil is going to happen? Well, just before something does, 
   an ill wind blows through a room and spreads dust around! I could go 
   on and on on how this is nothing but a slap in the face to Mario 
   Bava, but I am thankful that he&nbsp; passed away a decade earlier 
   before his son paid him this &quot;tribute&quot;. Not only doesn't 
   Lamberto have anyone with the talents of Barbara Steele for this 
   film, he also has no idea what makes Gothic horror work. He thinks 
   all he needs are a few good sets, some dark photography and a 
   constant wind blowing, but none of it will work if you don't have 
   talent and, sadly, Lamberto didn't inherit any of his father's. This 
   plays like a TV movie with some sparse scenes of nudity and graphic 
   violence (a flashback sequence is taken nearly verbatim from the 
   beginning of Mario's film, where the spiked mask is hammered on the 
   witch's face [gore effects by Sergio Stivaletti; <B><A HREF="wax_mask_1997.htm">THE
    WAX MASK</A></B> - 1997]). There's nothing in this film that's worth 
   mentioning, especially the non-ending. It ends like Bava ran out of 
   ideas or just didn't know how to finish it, so it just concludes with 
   no rhyme or reason! There's a reason why this film was never released 
   in the United States on VHS, disc or streaming. One look at it and

    Portland Oregon: Young child Cheryl is trying to sleep during a 
   raging thunderstorm and becomes scared, calling for her mother. When 
   Mommy doesn't answer, Cheryl goes looking for her in the house, but 
   can't find her. Somehow, Cheryl ends up in what looks like a creepy 
   mining cavern and above her is a giant pulsating sac that looks like 
   something is about to hatch out of it. A monstrous &quot;Beast&quot; 
   (Their words not mine) comes out of the sac and chases Cheryl (all we 
   see is the Beast's gnarly claw-like hands). Yep, turns out it was 
   only a nightmare, as Cheryl wakes up in bed and her mother is there 
   to comfort her, telling her that monsters don't exist and if they 
   did, she will protect her. I guess we all know that monsters do 
   exist, especially in crappy low-budget TV films like this. Cheryl 
   tells her mother that the Beast took her teddy bear and begs her to 
   get it back.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next time we see Cheryl, she is an adult (Virginia Bryant; 
   Bava's <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#PrinceOfTerror1988">THE 
   PRINCE OF TERROR</A></B> - 1988), in a car driven by her husband Tom 
   (Paolo Malco; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HouseByCemetery1981">THE 
   HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY</A></B> - 1981) and containing her young son, 
   Bobby (Patrizio Vinci, who is so bad you wish he was aborted). They 
   are on vacation, driving to a castle they have rented somewhere in 
   the mountains of Italy, a place they have never been to before. They 
   stop at a bar in a small village to ask directions and when Tom 
   mentions the name of the castle, the men in the bar (including an 
   uncredited Bava and Roberto Dell'Acqua [<B><A HREF="loaded_guns_1975.htm">LOADED
    GUNS</A></B> - 1975]) stop what they are doing and stare at him. The 
   barmaid obviously lies to them, saying she never heard of the place 
   and one of the men says they made a wrong turn, so Tom, Cheryl and 
   Bobby get back in their Jeep Cherokee and drive off, Cheryl telling 
   Tom she is certain the barmaid lied to them. We then discover that 
   Cheryl is an author of popular horror novels (of course she is!), 
   telling Bobby that she started writing them when she was in college. 
   They then find the castle, a huge stone edifice in the middle of 
   nowhere. As they sleep that night, Cheryl has the nightmare for the 
   first time since she was a child (only this time, young Cheryl gets 
   out of bed with an adult Tom sleeping next to her, making it look, 
   unintentionally, of course [?], like a pedophile's dream come true!). 
   As young Cheryl runs through the castle, the Beast seemingly bursts 
   out of a painting but, somehow, Cheryl ends up in the same mining 
   cavern and hides from the Beast (It's all rather confusing, so don't 
   try to make sense of it because it doesn't make any sense). Just as 
   the Beast grabs young Cheryl, the adult Cheryl wakes up. Tom asks 
   what is wrong and she tells him it was a nightmare she had when she 
   was a child and the castle has somehow revived the nightmare in her 
   subconscious. Bobby then starts screaming for help, so Cheryl runs to 
   his room (but not Tom!) and his bed is empty. She calls out for Bobby 
   but he doesn't answer. The door behind her slowly begins to open and 
   Bobby jumps out and says &quot;Boo!&quot;. Yes, this little snot was 
   playing a practical joke oh his mother and instead of taking him over 
   her knee and whipping his ass with a belt (as I would have...hey, I 
   had my ass beaten raw when I was a child!), Cheryl laughs and plays 
   along with it. Little bastard Bobby tells his mother he can't get to 
   sleep and doesn't know why (I know a good way to put him to 
   sleep...permanently!), but Cheryl gives him his favorite stuffed toy, 
   &quot;Mr. Rabbit&quot;, and tells him he needs to sleep because his 
   father is taking him on a hike in the morning. As Cheryl leaves 
   Bobby's bedroom, she discovers green slime on the doorknob and the 
   floor and a worried, scared look forms on her face. Is it possible 
   that the Beast is real?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Bobby and Tom are on their hike, Cheryl explores the castle 
   and finds a cobweb-filled room containing old scrapbooks and a 
   monstrous handprint on the window. So what does Cheryl do? Why, she 
   starts to type-up her latest horror novel, which she has titled 
   &quot;A Drawer Full Of Teeth&quot;! As she is typing, a cockroach 
   jams her typewriter on the letter &quot;A&quot; and she runs away and 
   goes to the store to pick up more writing materials! It's apparent 
   the residents of this tiny village don't take kindly to strangers, as 
   the saleslady at the register refuses to take Cheryl's American 
   Express Card, even though there is a sign in the window that states 
   they do take credit cards.

    Oh fuck! The hell with this review, I can't go on. This is the most 
   ham-fisted, boring horror film that I have ever laid eye(s) on. 
   Nothing happens here for nearly 94 minutes, except for extreme 
   tedium, plenty of false scares and a Beast we never get a clear view 
   of until the last minutes of the film. I first viewed this film early 
   in the New Millennium and promised myself I would never watch it 
   again, nevermind reviewing it, but here I am doing the exact 
   opposite, taking pen-to-paper-to-computer just so I can tell you how 
   bad this film really is. Not only did I nearly fall asleep (three 
   times!) watching this nonsense, I really wanted to plant my foot in 
   Lamberto Bava's nutsac for making such tripe. This is, for a better 
   phrase, filmic diarrhea, something I wouldn't let my worst enemy 
   watch, because no one should suffer such pain. Take my word for it, 
   this film is not worth your precious time, as the screenplay, by Bava 
   and Dardano Sacchetti (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982), offers no blood or gore, no foul 
   language and precious little nudity (except for a brief scene of Tom 
   and Cheryl taking a bath together, but we have more nudity from Paolo 
   Malco than we do from Virginia Bryant!), all things we all look for 
   in an Italian horror film. This is the nadir of filmmaking and is 
   possibly the worst film I have ever seen (the throwaway line Cheryl 
   says to Tom about Maria at the end of the film almost made me kick in 
   my TV screen!). I know that's a bold statement, but consider that a 
   warning to all you out there that want to watch this dreck. I just 
   may have saved your sanity, but I may have lost mine in the process..</FONT></FONT><BR>

   [2017]; once a pedophile, always a pedophile, but I judge films on 
   their merits, not by someone's criminal record), starts out like 
   gangbusters, it quickly sinks into the depths of despair, thanks to a 
   screenplay (co-written by Salva and producer Charles Agron) that 
   can't make up its mind what genre of film it wants to be. It also has 
   a finale that can best be described as rushed.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with 22-year-old Nick Di Santo (Luke Kleintank) 
   visiting his estranged mother Lilian (a cameo by Lesley-Anne Down; <B><A HREF="sphinx_1981.htm">SPHINX</A></B> 
   - 1981) at the insane asylum she has been committed to since Nick was 
   a young child. Lilian refuses to look at Nick, telling him &quot;the 
   Voice in the Wall&quot; told her that her son was about to have an 
   important deadly birthday and she needed to warn him. Nick rightfully 
   thinks his mother is crazier than a loon and quickly leaves the 
   asylum. We then see that Lilian was telling him the truth, as 
   &quot;the Voice in the Wall&quot; is angry at her, telling her that 
   she is about to suffer a fiery death. Nick then learns that his 
   mother died in a fire at the asylum, so he and his best friend Ryan 
   (Anthony Rey Perez) go to drown their sorrows at a bar, where Nick 
   meets pretty young woman Eve (Alex McKenna), who is also having a bad 
   day. We then learn that Nick has a very strange supernatural power. 
   By simply touching a person, he can tell when and how they will die 
   (He touches one young man at the bar, who is about to serve in the 
   military, and sees him die on the battlefield).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eight months pass and we can see Eve is very pregnant and it's 
   Nick's doing (even though they are not married). Nick goes to lawyer 
   Scott (Max Gail; TV's <B><A HREF="barney_miller_tv_series_1974-1982.htm">BARNEY
    MILLER</A></B> - [1974 - 1982])&nbsp; for the reading of his 
   mother's will and discovers he has inherited a creepy house he never 
   knew his mother owned, yet he shows Eve and Ryan that he has been 
   drawing pictures of that same house ever since he was a young boy; a 
   house that has something to do with his father, a man he has never 
   met and who his mother refused to talk about, not even telling Nick 
   his name. Nick talks Ryan and Eve into joining him to find the house 
   in hopes it will reveal the identity of his father. He is not going 
   to like what he discovers.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the trio get to the town where the house is supposed to be 
   located, they enter a diner and ask about<A HREF="dark_house_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dark house poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A> 
   the house's location, only to discover that the house was washed away 
   in a flood twenty years earlier. A man in the diner tells Nick that 
   legend has it that the house survived the flood and it now sits 
   somewhere in the woods, miles away from where it originally stood. 
   Nick, once again, talks Ryan and Eve into looking with him for the 
   house to see if the legend is true (This is where the film begins to 
   fall apart for me. Eve looks like she could drop the baby at any 
   moment, yet Nick makes her trek through the woods, miles away from a 
   hospital or a doctor. It's no wonder they aren't married. He doesn't 
   seem interested in the baby's safety at all!). When the trio are in 
   the woods looking for the house, they meet a trio of county land 
   surveyors, Sam (Ethan S. Smith), Lilith (Lacey Anzelc) and Chris 
   (Zack Ward; <B><A HREF="dont_blink_2014.htm">DON'T BLINK</A></B> - 
   2014). Chris tells Nick that he saw a huge trail in the woods, as if 
   something quite large carved a path during a flood. Nick decides to 
   follow it, with Chris and the surveyors leading the way and, sure 
   enough, they find the house, basically intact, nestled against a 
   giant tree that stopped it from traveling any further. The house is 
   in a severe state of disrepair, yet it is occupied by the scary Seth 
   (Tobin Bell; the <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2021.htm">SAW</A></B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2021.htm"> franchise</A> 
   [2004 - 2021]), who tells them to get away from &quot;his&quot; house 
   (he calls Sam an ancient form of his name, &quot;Samael&quot;, as if 
   he knows him). When Nick begins to ask questions and saying he is the 
   legal owner of the house, Seth lets him alone come into the house. 
   Then something creepy happens. As Seth tells Nick that the tree that 
   stopped the house from traveling any further is a &quot;hanging 
   tree&quot;, Nick is alerted by Ryan to come outside, they are being 
   surrounded by a bunch of long stringy-haired creepy demons carrying 
   axes and they chase everyone away from the house, running on all 
   fours, while throwing their axes at them (it's the film's only eerie 
   effective sequence). Sam is killed when one of the demons plants an 
   axe in his head, so everyone else jumps in the surveyor's van and 
   drive away quickly. The demons still chase them and we watch as the 
   van runs over one of them and it just gets up as if nothing happened 
   and continues to chase them, as if they are indestructible. Chris 
   drives them back to town to contact the police, but when they get 
   there, the town seems to be deserted. When Nick looks into the 
   diner's front window, it looks empty, but we can see that it is full 
   of people, like Nick, Ryan, Eve and the two surviving surveyors are 
   in some alternate plane of existence. To make matters worse, no 
   matter what direction they drive, it always leads them back to the 
   house. What in the Hell is going on here?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Long story short, Chris, Lilith and Sam are disciples of the Devil, 
   put on Earth to lead Nick to the house. The long-haired, axe-carrying 
   demons are actually God's angels, who are protecting the house to 
   make sure Nick never goes into the house's basement to free his 
   &quot;father&quot;, who is the Devil himself. It all leads to a 
   battle between the Devil's disciples and God's angels, as Nick (who 
   we discover is very evil) needs 23 human hearts to free his father. 
   He now has twenty, so Nick thrusts his hand through Ryan's back to 
   rip out his heart and then goes after Eve and her unborn baby to 
   reach his goal of 23 hearts, but Seth rescues her, killing Nick and 
   bringing Eve to the hospital, where she has her baby, a boy. Four 
   years pass and we see Eve's young son drawing a picture of the Dark 
   House, while a &quot;Voice in the Wall&quot; tells him how the house 
   should look and that he will see it in person on his 23rd birthday. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    My biggest problem with this film, besides the hackneyed plot, was 
   how fast Nick's demeanor changed from good to evil in the film's 
   finale. His 180&#176; turn makes absolutely no sense and seems to 
   happen just to advance the plot for the &quot;surprise&quot; 
   denouement, which isn't a surprise at all, it just seems tacked-on 
   for an eventual sequel (which, thankfully, never materialized), 
   trying to make us forget the story's many gaping plot holes. While I 
   do not try to hide my distain for Victor Salva as a despicable human 
   being, there's no arguing that he has talent as a director, as this 
   film does have some very atmosphereic sequences and some dollops of 
   graphic gore, but as a screenwriter, he just doesn't have the chops 
   to pull off this film's lofty ambitions, which is where this film 
   fails big time. People do the stupidest things possible (After being 
   trapped in the house by God's angels, Ryan and Lilith sneak out of 
   the house and go to the van, where they make love! Really?) just to 
   advance the plot. Speaking of this film's lofty ambitions, it is 
   obvious that Salva got the money to make this film from a doctor and 
   a lawyer, as one producer's name ends in &quot;M.D.&quot; and 
   another's ends in &quot;Esq.&quot; (Tobin Bell also gets a producer's 
   credit). This film could have been so much better if Salva stepped 
   away from the writer's table and let someone else be in charge of the 
   screenplay. As it stands now, this film (originally titled <B>HAUNTED</B>)
    is nothing more than an atmospheric grand failure. Also featuring
