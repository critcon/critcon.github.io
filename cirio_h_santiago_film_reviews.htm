   Champion martial artist Kristie Lang (Sibel Birzag) catches the 
   murder of an American soldier in Manila with her camera and calls the 
   American Embassy to report what she saw. Before she can hand over the 
   film to Embassy representative Victor Winslow (Joseph Zucchero), she 
   is viciously slashed and stabbed to death by the same black-garbed 
   people who murdered the American soldier. Luckily, she passed the 
   film to a cabbie before she was killed, telling him to give it to a 
   stripper friend of hers named Sulu. Kirstie's sister, L.A. cop Kat 
   Lang (Cat Sassoon, who has the fattest lips this side of a spousal 
   abuse victim), travels to Manila to investigate her sister's death, 
   but it's strictly off the books. After losing her luggage and money 
   immediately after setting foot in Manila (this film is not an 
   endorsement for tourism), Kat meets conman Alcatraz (Michael Shaner; <B><A HREF="bloodfist_1989.htm">BLOODFIST</A></B> 
   - 1989), who knew Kristie and offers to help Kat find her murderer 
   (he has ulterior motives, though, like getting into Kat's tight 
   pants). He convinces Kat to take her sister's place in the upcoming 
   big martial arts tournament, s<A HREF="angel_fist_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/angel fist vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="253" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>o
    he hooks her up with Kristie's trainer, Bayani (Roland Dantes), and 
   tournament promoter Mr. Carrion (Tony Carrion), who's not quite what 
   he seems to be. As Kat begins rising through the tournament ranks 
   (and making Alcatraz a hefty sum on side bets), she slowly makes 
   friends with fellow tournament fighter Lorda (Melissa Moore; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#OneManArmy">ONE
    MAN ARMY</A></B> - 1993), while Alcatraz gets closer to finding 
   Kirstie's stripper friend Sulu. Kat discovers Kristie and Lorda were 
   working undercover with the FBI to find out the identities of members 
   of the Black Brigade, a militant group that wants to destroy the 
   relationship between America and the Philippines. Kat gets into deep 
   trouble when Lorda is kidnapped by the Black Brigade and they put 
   Kat, along with visiting American Ambassador Franklin (Ken Metcalfe), 
   at the top of their hit list. When Victor Winslow blackmails Alcatraz 
   to keep Kat off the trail of the Black Brigade, Alcatraz finally gets 
   to bed Kat and decides that she's too good to deceive. He finds Sulu, 
   recovers the film and brings the proof to the American Embassy. Lorda 
   escapes her captors, helps Kat save Ambassador Franklin's life and 
   brings down the Black Brigade. The Philippines is safe once again for 
   Americans, but please use caution when drinking the water.&nbsp; This 
   is director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's third time to the well 
   telling the same story, starting with <B><A HREF="#TNT Jackson">TNT JACKSON</A></B> 
   in 1975 and <B><A HREF="#Firecracker1981">FIRECRACKER</A></B> in 
   1981. The problem here is, Cat Sassoon (<B><A HREF="dance_with_death_1991.htm">DANCE
    WITH DEATH</A></B> -1991) is a terrible actress, although she has 
   the best tits money can buy, not to mention plenty of nude scenes, 
   including a topless fight in a bedroom that copies both <B>TNT</B> 
   and <B>FIRECRACKER</B>. Cat, who was the daughter of hair care 
   specialist Vidal Sassoon and sister of director Oley Sassoon (<B><A HREF="bloodfist_series_dvd.htm">BLOODFIST
    III: FORCED TO FIGHT</A></B> - 1993), died at age 32 of a heart 
   attack (drugs were suspected but never confirmed) while attending a 
   New Year's party to ring in 2002. <B><A HREF="angel_fist_1992c.htm">ANGELFIST</A></B> 
   is not a very good film (the martial arts fights are clunky and 
   badly-staged), but Santiago offers a ton of nudity (both Sassoon and 
   Melissa Moore disrobe as much as possible and there are more communal 
   shower scenes here than in most WIP films) and some truly demented 
   sequences, such as when Black Brigade leader Cirio Quirino (Santiago 
   regular Henry Strzalkowski) tortures Lorda in an icehouse by 
   stripping off her blouse and pressing her naked breasts on a block of 
   ice! This short, 80-minute film is light on blood and gore (just a 
   few stabbings in the beginning)<B>,</B> has no gunfights and nothing 
   explodes. One gets the feeling that Santiago was on cruise control 
   here and was taking a break from his usual shoot-em-up actioners, but 
   the sad fact was that Santiago would go on to direct a few of these 
   modern-day martial arts flicks and would not go back to his mindless 
   gunplay flicks. Too bad, because he was quite good at 'em. This is a 
   lesser, latter-day entry from Santiago that can be avoided unless you 
   like lots of nudity (Sassoon is well-oiled in all her full-frontal 
   shots) and the sight of lips that can best be described as 
   &quot;distracting&quot;. Also starring Denise Buick, Jessica Roberts, 
   Christina Portugal, Jim Moss, Bob Larson, Sheila Lintan, Ramon 
   D'Salva and Ronald Asinas. Available on VHS and (fullscreen) DVD from 
   New Horizons Home Video. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    GODS AND IRON MEN</A><A NAME="BambooGodsIronMen"></A> (1974) -</B> 
   Fun Filipino film, a mixture of martial arts action and comedy 
   elements. Legend says that a pouch recently stolen from the grave of 
   a 10th Century Chinese scientist contains a substance so powerful, 
   whomever is in possession of it can rule or destroy the world. 
   Professional boxer Calvin Jefferson (James Iglehart; <B><A HREF="#Savage1973">SAVAGE</A></B> 
   - 1973; <B><A HREF="#FightingMad1978">FIGHTING MAD</A></B> - 1978) 
   and his new bride Marlene (Shirley Washington; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#DarktownStrutters">DARKTOWN
    STRUTTERS</A></B> - 1974) are visiting Hong Kong on their honeymoon 
   and get mixed up in the whole mess when one of the bad guys places 
   the pouch in a statue of Buddha that Marlene bought as a souvenir. 
   The bad guy does this to insure that the pouch will make it out of 
   Hong Kong customs and to Manila, where head bad guy, Leo King (a bald 
   Ken Metcalfe, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Zucchero, who 
   also has a role here), plans on retrieving it and ruling the world. 
   While in Hong Kong, Calvin saves the life of mute peasant Chow Lee 
   (Chiquito; <B><A HREF="arizona_kid_1971.htm">ARIZONA KID</A></B> - 
   1971; <B><A HREF="james_wong_1973.htm">JAMES WONG</A></B> - 1973), 
   who was knocked-out and thrown in the ocean by three street thugs 
   after saving a young woman from being raped. Calvin jumps in the 
   ocean and saves his life and from that moment on, Chow Lee (who 
   Calvin renames &quot;Charley&quot;) is indebted to lifelong servitude 
   to Calvin and becomes an unwanted third wheel in Ca<A HREF="bamboo_gods_and_iron_men_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bamboo gods &amp; iron men poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>lvin
    and Marlene's honeymoon. No matter how much they try to ditch him, 
   Charley says close behind them, stowing away on the ship to Manila 
   and eventually saving Calvin's life when Mr. King's goons try to 
   steal the Buddha (Charley's very good in the arts that are martial). 
   Calvin and Marlene eventually welcome Charley into their lives and 
   it's a good thing, too, because Mr. King sends wave after wave of bad 
   guys to steal the Buddha. Charley teaches Calvin the finer points of 
   the martial arts to go along with his boxing skills (which aren't 
   very good when you're facing kung-fu experts) and when Mr. King 
   finally steals the Buddha and finds that the pouch is not in it, 
   Calvin will have to use his new-found skills when Mr. King believes 
   he stole the pouch. Mr. King kidnaps Marlene, which forces Calvin and 
   Charley to figure out where the pouch is and deliver it to Mr. King 
   before Marlene is killed. Charley discovers the true location of the 
   pouch and races to Mr. King's hideout with an inept police detective 
   in tow to stop Calvin from making a big mistake. Everything works out 
   in the end when it is discovered that the &quot;powerful&quot; 
   substance in the pouch is nothing but simple gunpowder (powerful in 
   the 10th Century, no so much today). Everyone, including Mr. King, 
   have a good laugh when the gunpowder explodes in their faces, making 
   everyone look like performers in a minstrel show. Oh, and Charley 
   regains his ability to speak thanks to the explosion!&nbsp; This 
   Filipino action film, directed by Cesar Gallardo (<B><A HREF="hustler_squad_1976.htm">HUSTLER
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1976) and produced by Cirio H. Santiago (<B><A HREF="#TNT Jackson">TNT
    JACKSON</A></B> - 1975), is a funny, if derivative, martial arts 
   variation of <B>THE MALTESE FALCON</B> (1941) and bears striking 
   similarities to director Robert Clouse's <B><A HREF="golden_needles_1974.htm">GOLDEN
    NEEDLES</A></B>, made the same year as this. Lighthearted in tone, 
   yet still containing bloody deaths and scenes of rape, <B>BAMBOO GODS 
   AND IRON MEN</B> treads a fine line between comedy and violence and 
   succeeds most of the time. James Iglehart and Shirley Washington are 
   surprisingly good as the newlywed couple and popular Filipino 
   comedian Chiquito is very funny as the mute Charley. While he's a 
   little too broad at times and his martial arts skills questionable at 
   best (for a martial arts master, he sure does get knocked-out a lot), 
   Chiquito makes a good silent partner for Iglehart. There are some 
   funny sequences between the two, such as when Mr. King's head 
   henchmen, Ambrose (Eddie Garcia; <B><A HREF="beast_of_blood.htm">BEAST
    OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1970; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomanHunt1972">THE
    WOMAN HUNT</A></B> - 1972), brings the duo to a massage parlor under 
   false pretenses, which results in some hand-to-hand combat between 
   the parties (and lots of screaming topless women) and Charley running 
   out of the building bare-assed. There are plenty of badly-staged 
   martial arts fights on view, but it is the goofy comedy (especially 
   the unbelievable ending) by the game cast, including Ken Metcalfe 
   (who seems to be in at least 80% of the Filipino action flicks I have 
   seen), that will suck you in. Not a good film by any stretch of the 
   imagination (the production values are horrid and the editing and 
   sound recording are piss-poor), but an entertaining one nonetheless. 
   Cesar Gallardo's son, Jun Gallardo (who was Associate Director here), 
   directed many Filipino action flicks, Including <B><A HREF="action.htm#Rescue Team">RESCUE
    TEAM</A></B> (1983), <A HREF="action.htm#CommandoInvasion"><B>COMMANDO
    INVASION</B></A> (1986) and <B><A HREF="action.htm#SFXRetaliator">SFX
    RETALIATOR</A></B> (1987), usually using the pseudonym &quot;John 
   Gale&quot;. Also starring Marissa Delgado, Michael Boyet, Robert 
   Rivera, Leo Martinez, Zubas Herrero, Benny Pestano, Steve Alcardo and 
   a cameo by Vic Diaz as a hotel desk clerk. Distributed theatrically 
   by American International Pictures. Never released legitimately on 
   home video in the U.S., but it did get a Canadian VHS release through 
   Astral Films. Available on DVD-R from many gray market sellers, 
   including <A HREF="http://www.cinefear.com">Cinefear Home Video</A>. <B>Rated

   Lieutenant Johnny Ransom (Robert Patrick; <B><A HREF="marine_2006.htm">THE
    MARINE</A></B> - 2006) leads his squad of soldiers deep into enemy 
   territory during the Vietnam War. Their mission: To find American 
   POWs and bring them back alive. After capturing a gook soldier and 
   &quot;questioning&quot; him (by sticking a live grenade in his 
   mouth), they head to an enemy camp where four American POWs are being 
   held. It turns out to be a trap, as Lt. Ransom and his men are 
   outgunned, overpowered and forced to surrender. The head of the camp, 
   Tran Van Minh (scripter Joe Mari Avellana), and Russian advisor 
   Dimitri (Robert Dryer; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Savage Streets">SAVAGE
    STREETS</A></B> - 1984), then shoot the four American POWs 
   point-blank in front of Ransom and his men. After a short sequence 
   where everyone but Ransom, Jacobs (William Steis) and Keller (Morgan 
   Douglas) are tortured and killed, Ransom escapse, leaving Jacobs and 
   Keller behind. When Ransom gets back to base camp, he finds out that 
   the Paris Accord has been signed, effectively ending the war. Ransom 
   and fellow soldier Sam (Rey Malanzo; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Classified Operatio">CLASSIFIED

    some soldiers, hop in a helicopter and assault the enemy camp, 
   rescuing Jacobs and Keller and killing Tran Van Minh. Dimitri gets 
   away and Ransom is seriously injured and is sent to a military 
   hospital in Thailand, where he is tended to by old flame Terry 
   (Barbara Hooper). Meanwhile, Sam is assigned to escort an important 
   enemy General back to base camp. The General has switched sides and 
   is willing to turn over a secret codebook to the Americans that 
   contains the names of American double agents. Dimitri has other 
   plans, though, and ambushes Sam's squad, taking Sam and the General 
   prisoner and killing everyone else. After getting a little nookie 
   from Terry, Lt. Ransom heads out to rescue Sam and the General, aided 
   by Captain Dupre (Lydie Denier) and her squad of French resistance 
   fighters, as well as Jacobs and Keller, who have a score to settle 
   with Dimitri. They all manage to save the General and kill Dimitri 
   (unfortunately, Sam is long-dead, hanging upside down from a tree and 
   being eaten by rats). Keller even finds the time to romance Capt. 
   Dupre, but when Ransom gets back to headquarters and the codebook is 
   deciphered, he discovers that someone close to him is a traitor, 
   which forces him to seek justice through the barrel of a gun. I 
   didn't see that coming.&nbsp; This is the second of Filipino director 
   Cirio H. Santiago's Vietnam War action flicks that he made in the 
   80's. Robert Patrick reprises the same role he portrayed in 
   Santiago's first Nam film, <B><A HREF="eye_of_the_eagle_1986.htm">EYE 
   OF THE EAGLE</A></B> (1987), only this time it's a starring role 
   rather than a secondary character, as he was in <B>EYE</B>. Patrick, 
   who got his start in other Santiago-directed films like <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Equalizer2000">EQUALIZER
    2000</A></B> and <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Future Hunters">FUTURE
    HUNTERS</A></B> (both 1986), still comes off as too over-animated, 
   yelling out his lines rather than speaking them. It would take him a 
   few more years to find his acting groove (his breakout role in <B><A HREF="terminator_2_judgement_day_1991.htm">TERMINATOR
    2</A></B> [1991] was basically a non-speaking role) and he would 
   also make his mark on TV in such series as <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
    X-FILES</A></B> and <B><A HREF="unit_tv_series.htm">THE UNIT</A></B>.
    Santiago offers his usual cornucopia of action set-pieces, including 
   lots of gunfights, explosions and bloody bullet squibs. There are 
   also some brief nude scenes, a smattering of gore (shots to the head; 
   Sam being eaten by rats) and a good helicopter explosion (this one 
   isn't a model). Frequent Santiago collaborator Joe Mari Avellana's 
   script is nothing special, but the acting by a cast of Santiago 
   regulars makes it all bearable. The stinger at the end was also a 
   nice touch and totally unexpected. My appreciation of Santiago as a 
   director increases every time I watch another film of his. The 
   majority of his films may be nothing more than rip-offs of other 
   movies, but he is a professional and is capable of turning out 
   compact (the majority of his films run 85 minutes or less), 
   entertaining time-wasters. Also known as <B><A HREF="killer_instinct_1987.htm">KILLER
    INSTINCT</A></B>. The next film in Santiago's Nam actioners was <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Expendables1988">THE

   he witnesses the after-effects of her brainwashing electric shock 
   treatments. When Pram tries to smuggle Denise out of the camp in the 
   back of a truck and Van Duc is waiting for them at the front gate, it 
   proves that one of the women prisoners is an informer. But which one 
   is it? All evidence points to Honey (Taffy O'Connell), an American 
   who sleeps with most of the guards and spends too much time in Van 
   Duc's office, but that would be too easy. Denise and Pram still 
   manage to escape, but Van Duc's men are only one step behind them. 
   After they make love in a jungle cabin, Pram is shot dead by his 
   fellow guards and Denise is brought back to the camp, where she is 
   tortured. All the girls are then loaded onto a train and told that 
   they are going home, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. The 
   train stops in the middle of a field and the guards gang-rape all the 
   women and shoot those in the back that try to escape. The remaining 
   women discover the identity of the informer, kill her and then take 
   over the train, where they escape to the safety of a waiting 
   helicopter. Are the women actually saved or will a simple phone call 
   turn them into explosive assassins? I'm afraid only time will 
   tell.&nbsp; A lot of people believe that this is Filipino director 
   Cirio H. Santiago's best film and I can't really fault them for 
   thinking that. While not as action-packed as most of Santiago's 80's 
   films, it is better plotted than most (script by frequent Santiago 
   bit player Bobby Greenwood) and probably contains more nudity than 
   half a dozen of his other films put together. Santiago also tosses-in 
   much more human drama than usual, especially the romance between 
   Denise and Pram that ends tragically. There is also a mystery element 
   as we try to determine who's the informer and it's not as easy as you 
   think. Santiago films the mass rape on the train as a series of 
   slow-motion shots, edited in such a way as to show the fear and 
   helplessness in all the women's faces while the guards leer and laugh 
   and shoot women in the back like they were shooting skeet. It's a 
   very effective sequence, as is Pram's gunfight with his fellow 
   guards, which takes place next to a pen of loudly-chirping baby 
   chicks. This was also one of the few Santiago films that wasn't 
   financed by Roger Corman. Future director Jim Wynorski (<B><A HREF="chopping_mall_1986.htm">CHOPPING

    early-90's output, where boss Corman, who Santiago almost worked 
   exclusively with during the 70s, 80s &amp; 90s, cut budgets on all

   (Ramon D'Salva; <B><A HREF="#LiveByTheFist">LIVE BY THE FIST</A></B> 
   - 1993) being shot several times by protestors who do not like his 
   policies of kowtowing to the American military that occupies his 
   country. Lim's daughter, Marga (Chanel Akiko Hirai), is particularly 
   distressed that her father has the nerve to flout his American 
   mistress, Amanda (Jewel Shepard; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Raw Force">RAW
    FORCE</A></B> - 1982), out in public. When it turns out that the 
   shooting was staged so Lim and Marga could leave the country and live 
   in New York, a monkey wrench is thrown into the gears when Marga is 
   arrested and sentenced to spend the rest of her life on The Rock, an 
   inescapable maximum security prison located on an Alcatraz-like 
   island. Lim refuses to leave the country without his daughter (and 
   threatens to expose the American military's illegal dealings in his 
   country), so Amanda agrees to go undercover as a prisoner on the 
   island to break Marga out. Unfortunately, Amanda accidentally gets 
   American tourist Lucy (Susan Harvey) arrested at the airport (she has 
   a suitcase full of illegal porn films!), so she, too, is sent to The 
   Rock with Amanda. The Rock's horny Warden Chen (Vic Diaz; <B><A HREF="#Equalizer2000">EQUALIZER

   making her strip and trying to fondle her breasts, but he really has 
   his his eye on Marga as his next sexual conquest (He says, &quot;I 
   never had a princess before!&quot;). Amanda has it hard, trying to 
   protect Lucy from butch prisoner Paula (Pamella D'Pella) and 
   reasoning with Marga to escape with her from the prison (Marga would 
   rather be executed than be shamed by her father's treasonous 
   actions). After finally setting Marga straight about her father, 
   Amanda and Marga escape the prison and run into the jungle with the 
   help of two undercover guards. Their escape is short-lived when one 
   of the guards (Totoy Torres, here billed as &quot;Joe Towers&quot; in 
   the opening credits [but using his real name in the closing credits!] 
   and also the Assistant Director) turns out to be a traitor and Warden 
   Chen captures them on the beach. Warden Chen rapes Marga on the beach 
   and hangs Amanda by her hair before eventually throwing them both 
   back in their cells. The remainder of the film finds Amanda and Lucy 
   trying to break Marga out of prison before she is executed for crimes 
   against her country. Along the way, all three will suffer more 
   degradation, including rape (both lesbian and straight), forced drug 
   addiction and constant catfights with Paula and her gang of lesbos. 
   Will all three live to see freedom? When King Lim dies of a sudden 
   heart attack, everything changes and most of it is not good, both for 
   Marga and Lucy. Amanda has to decide if she is going to obey her new 
   orders from her CIA boss, Carl Daimyo (Ed Crick; <B><A HREF="#Naked Vengeance">NAKED
    VENGEANCE</A></B> - 1985) and escape from prison alone. Don't count 
   on it.&nbsp; This is a fairly by-the-numbers WIP flick which contains 
   all the usual standbys. Director Cirio H. Santaigo and screenwriter 
   Paul Ziller (who directed such genre films as <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#PledgeNight">PLEDGE
    NIGHT</A></B> [1988] and <B><A HREF="snakehead_terror_2003.htm">SNAKEHEAD
    TERROR</A></B> [2003]) fill this film with plenty of female nudity, 
   shower scenes, catfights, a whipping scene and lots of rape. This is 
   probably the biggest film role Vic Diaz had in the 90's and he looks 
   like he is having one helluva time here, whether it is stripping and 
   raping women in his office that contains one of the biggest bird 
   cages I have ever seen (filled with hundreds of birds), shooting 
   traitors and faithful guards with equal abandon or drugging women to 
   get them &quot;in the mood&quot;. The action scenes don't really come 
   until the final third, but the gunfights and explosions are 
   well-handled because Santiago was an old hand at this kind of stuff. 
   Nothing spectacular, but entertaining nonetheless. Also starring Bon 
   Vibar, Philip Gordon, Ronald Asinas, Manny Samson and Henry 
   Strzalkowski as an undercover CIA agent disguised as an ice cream 
   vendor. Originally available on VHS by New Horizons Home Video and

    OF PARADISE</A><A NAME="DemonOfParadise"></A> (1987) -</B> A group 
   of fishermen in Kihono, Hawaii are illegally fishing with dynamite 
   when they unleash a long-dormant creature (in other words, a man in a 
   rubber suit). After causing the fishermen to blow up their own boat, 
   the creature then goes on a killing spree. The local natives believe 
   that a mystical beast called Acua has returned, so they perform an 
   ancient ritual (lots of hula dancing) to keep the creature at bay so 
   they can continue fishing. It doesn't work. Local cop Keefer (William

   fishermen (the ones that aren't superstitious, that is). As the 
   tourists start pouring in, the killings begin to escalate and Keefer 
   wants to close down the resort's lake, but in true <B><A HREF="jaws.htm">JAWS</A></B> 
   fashion, Cahill refuses and tells Keefer to do his job (&quot;I'm not 
   going to let anyone railroad me!&quot;). Cahill holds a &quot;Creature
    Egg Hunt&quot;, where the tourists search for eggs hidden around the 
   resort (you've got to be kidding me!), but when Keefer and his men 
   have a shootout with Langley and Shelton and the creature puts in an 
   appearance and kills Shelton, all the tourists leave the resort in a 
   panic. Keefer calls in the National Guard and they drop grenades on 
   the creature from a helicopter. This just pisses-off the creature, as 
   it then walks on land for the first time and traps everyone in the 
   resort's main cabin. The creature begins picking off people 
   one-by-one and then chases the remaining survivors to the ruins of an 
   ancient temple, where the creature faces-off with Keefer, Annie and 
   the National Guard in the film's explosive finale.&nbsp; This is 
   prolific Filipino director Cirio H. Santiago's second horror film 
   (after <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Vampire Hookers">VAMPIRE HOOKERS</A></B> 
   - 1979) and it's easy to see why he didn't make any more. He stinks 
   at it. This is basically a remake of <B><A HREF="up_from_the_depths_1979.htm">UP
    FROM THE DEPTHS</A></B> (1979; which Santiago produced) and it's a 
   boring mess, with long stretches where nothing happens, followed by 
   an explosion every now and then, followed by an appearance of the 
   creature, which is laughable at best. The subplot about Keefer's past 
   is never fleshed out, besides him saying &quot;I came here to get 
   away from this stuff!&quot; when the murders begin to happen and then 
   later mentioning to Annie that he is a widower (we never really know 
   if the serial killer back in Reno murdered his wife). The film is 
   also rather dry and relatively gore-free for a horror film. The 
   creature attack scenes are few and far between (the sparse gore 
   consists of after-effects of the creature attacks, like slash marks 
   on the face and chest of it's victims), as Santiago would rather 
   focus on the action elements of the film, like Langley and Shelton's 
   dynamite exploits and several gunfights and explosions. Santiago 
   could be an efficient director when faced with the right material 
   (see reviews of <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#FinalMission1984">FINAL MISSION</A></B>

   but he seems uncomfortable when it comes to directing horror. He 
   plays it way too safe, which is probably why he didn't make more of 
   them after this. Almost all of Santiago's action and post-nuke flicks (<B><A HREF="stryker_1983.htm">STRYKER</A></B>

   death. Deacon begins asking questions around town, but finds everyone 
   afraid to talk. While out on a date with Audrey, Carey and his men 
   force Deacon's car off the road and beat the shit out of him (Casey 
   also has the hots for Audrey). When Deacon doesn't take the hint to 
   leave town, a couple of Carey's men firebomb Elaine's house, killing 
   her (she burns to death in her bed), which results in Deacon chasing 
   the two goons in his car. Deacon's car flips over and explodes, so 
   Carey thinks Deacon is dead and his problems are over. In reality, 
   Deacon escaped the explosion and he's about to make Carey's life 
   miserable. Deacon contacts his old Nam buddies, electronics expert 
   Spenser (Terrence O'Hara), explosives expert Bartlett (Bill 
   McLaughlin) and insane muscleman Ox (Jack Daniels) and they head to 
   King's Ransom for some good, old-fashioned payback. Audrey puts them 
   up in a secret cabin in the woods, as Deacon and his squad

   more of his men end up missing, Carey's men capture Bartlett, hold 
   him in a cell at the Sheriff's office and beat the crap out of him, 
   but Deacon and his men pull a midnight rescue and save Bartlett. 
   Carey kidnaps Audrey (and blows up her gas station) and uses her as 
   bait. The finale finds Deacon, his men and Sheriff Marsh (who finally 
   comes to his senses) battling Carey and his gang while trying save 
   Audrey and blowing up a dam to flood the pot crop. Not everyone (both 
   good and bad) will make it out alive.&nbsp; This is another one of 
   Filipino director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's long line of 80's

   here), he was capable of turning out some entertaining low-budget 
   flicks. It's no wonder Roger Corman funded many of his films, because 
   Santiago knew how to stretch a buck to the breaking point, yet he 
   could still deliver interesting, if unoriginal, product. The script 
   is by frequent Santiago collaborator Joseph Zucchero (who also has

   Miranda (Isabel Lopez), who knows about Michael's past with William, 
   but William stops her from telling the others. Val and her five 
   warriors regain control of her village rather easily and begin 
   training the villagers, who are mainly farmers, how to fight in 
   preparation for William's arrival. Val's fiance, Luis (Henry 
   Strzalkowski), becomes jealous when Val shows an interest in Dorian, 
   so he turns traitorous and frees Tomas, who warns William what is 
   waiting for him in the village. William has a hard time believing 
   that only five people could defeat Tomas' squad, so he sends an 
   advance force to kill them, which fails terribly. William eventually 
   recaptures the village and takes Val and Dorian prisoner, but in an 
   incredible stroke of luck (some would say too incredible), John finds 
   a cache of weapons and explosives hidden in a cave. He arms all the 
   villagers and they assault the village, while Michael and William 
   settle an old score, having a swordfight with each other in the 
   middle of the raging battlefield. Just what was their beef anyway? 
   Really, can someone please tell me?&nbsp; Is it derivative? Sure.

   to connect those scenes together. Santiago follows the Roger Corman 
   Principle (Corman financed many of Santiago's films, including this 
   one): Keep it short (this film is barely 77 minutes long), keep it 
   simple and give viewers what they expect, which is explosions, gun 
   battles, martial arts fights, gore and nudity (both Jillian McWhirter 
   and Isabel Lopez have topless scenes). Even David Carradine, who was 
   usually just slumming around in low-budget films during this point in 
   his career (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#KarateCop">KARATE COP</A></B>

   Alaska: A hundred years after the nuclear winter.&quot; The ice caps 
   have melted and most of the potable water has disappeared. The Earth 
   is nothing but a scorched shell and the remaining humans are ruled by 
   a brutal dictatorship known as The Ownership, whose main base sits on 
   top of the Alaskan oil pipeline. Those who control the oil controls 
   the world. A faction of the rebel forces, who are fighting for a 
   supply of oil, capture Ownership member Captain Slade (Richard

   but he escapes. Meanwhile, a sexy, leather-clad woman named Karen 
   (Corrine Wahl) rips-off a group of black marketeers (who dress like 
   Southern rebels during the Civil War), led by Alamo (Henry 
   Strzalkowski) and Deke (Robert Patrick), and takes off with a few 
   crates of their explosives (this was supposed to be a 
   gas-for-explosives trade, but when the goofballs put the moves on

   Karen's ass. Now, Slade is not only wanted by The Ownership (who 
   think he's a traitor) and the rebels, he's also on Alamo and Deke's 
   shit list. Karen takes a wounded Slade to her village to recover, 
   while The Ownership recruits Alamo and Deke's gang to look for Slade. 
   Dixon (Rex Cutter), the leader of Karen's village, has developed a multi-barreled
    handheld weapon called the Equalizer 2000, capable of firing 
   bullets, shotgun shells, grenades and rockets. Slade <A HREF="equalizer_2000_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/equalizer 2000 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="251" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>helps
    refine the weapon in hopes of using it against Colonel Lawton 
   (William Steis), a sadistic Ownership member and former friend of 
   Slade's who has become power-hungry. Lawton and his men travel the 
   barren landscape, killing anyone who don't agree with The Ownership 
   rules. Lawton eventually makes it to Karen's village and a huge 
   firefight breaks out, but Slade and the Equalizer 2000 manage to hold 
   Lawton back until the villagers escape to safety. Once Lawton sees 
   the new weapon, he must have it, so he orders his men to get it any 
   way they can. Alamo and Deke manage to steal the weapon, kidnap Karen 
   and break off from The Ownership. Deke betrays Alamo (never trust a 
   black marketeer) and takes off with the weapon, giving it to Lawton 
   (and paying for it with his life). Lawton uses the Equalizer 2000 to 
   take control of The Ownership and the finale finds Karen's village 
   joining Slade and the rebels in storming The Ownership's 
   headquarters. After the good guys win, Slade destroys the Equalizer 
   2000, so no one else is tempted to take over the world. Everyone else 
   throws their weapons into a bonfire and they all live happily ever

    EXPENDABLES</A><A NAME="Expendables1988"></A> (1988) -</B> This 
   Vietnam War action film opens with Captain Rosello (Anthony Finetti) 
   leading a platoon into an enemy village and destroying a munitions 
   dump, but not before taking on heavy casualties. When the mission is 
   completed, the only people left alive are Rosello, another soldier 
   and a baby that Rosello rescues after he is forced to kill it's 
   traitorous mother. Back at base camp, Rosello is informed by his 
   Commanding Officer that no other soldiers want to work with him 
   because every mission he leads, very few soldiers come back alive. 
   Rosello is then ordered to lead a squad of misfits, con men and 
   criminals on his latest mission, but first he has to get them to work 
   together as a team. That won't be easy. This group of roustabouts 
   have more issues than National Geographic. There's the wise-mouthed 
   black demolitions expert, Jackson (Kevin Duffis); deeply religious 
   Bible-thumper with the prophetic name Elijah Lord (Loren Haynes, who 
   also wrote and sings the film's closing tune); full-fledged bigot 
   Richter (Jeff Griffith), who looks at Jackson and says, &quot;Apes 
   ain't my brothers!&quot;; hard-partying pothead Sterling (Peter 
   Nelson); and the mysterious Navarro (Eric Hahn). Before you can say <B><A HREF="dirty_dozen_1967.htm">THE
    DIRTY DOZEN</A></B> (1967), Captain Rosello is seen whipping the 
   squad into shape in typical 80's fashion, while we watch the members 
   try to work out their differences, especially between Rich<A HREF="expendables_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/expendables vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="270" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ter
    and Jackson (When Richter says, &quot;I smell a nigger!&quot;, it 
   leads to a lengthy fistfight between the two). Rosello finally leads 
   his men on their first mission: Capturing a Viet Cong Colonel 
   (Filipino staple Vic Diaz, in a much larger role than usual) and 
   blowing up an enemy bridge. They somehow manage to complete their 
   objectives, but they aren't yet working together as a squad (Rosello 
   tells his Commanding Officer after the mission, &quot;They can't even 
   wipe their own asses!&quot;, to which his C.O. responds, &quot;Then 
   you wipe for them!&quot;). Slowly but surely, everyone begins working 
   together as a team and learn to put their differences aside. After 
   taking a major casualty on their second mission, Roselli decides to 
   take his men for a night out on the town, which leads to a 
   prerequisite bar fight with a bunch of drunken Marines (one is 
   portrayed by an uncredited Nick Nicholson). They all get thrown into 
   the brig, but when enemy forces invade the hospital to free their 
   captured Colonel and take some female nurses hostage, Captain Roselli 
   and the Expendables swing into action in what will turn out to be 
   their most dangerous (and fatal) mission. For the first time, Captain 
   Roselli experiences the hollow experience of victory in the face of 
   sacrifice.&nbsp; This is Filipino director Cirio H. Santiago's third 
   80's Vietnam War film, after <B><A HREF="eye_of_the_eagle_1986.htm">EYE
    OF THE EAGLE</A></B> and <B><A HREF="#BehindEnemyLines87">BEHIND 
   ENEMY LINES</A></B> (both 1987), and while it offers nothing new to 
   the genre (all the characters are straight out of Stereotypes 101), 
   it still manages to be strangely compelling, not to mention 
   action-packed. Santiago always staffs his films with his usual cast 
   of professionals and <B><A HREF="expendables_1988c.htm">THE EXPENDABLES</A></B> 
   benefits from it. As a matter of fact, the weakest actor here is 
   Anthony Finetti as Captain Rosello, who is a newcomer to the Santiago 
   universe. Nearly everyone else, from Rosello's Commanding Officer 
   (William Steis; the star of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DemonOfParadise">DEMON
    OF PARADISE</A></B> - 1987) to all the members of the Expendables, 
   have appeared in numerous Santiago productions, sometimes taking-on 
   leading and secondary roles and other times appearing in uncredited 
   bit parts. That is why most of Santiago's films, whether good or bad, 
   are at least well-acted. <B>THE EXPENDABLES</B> also contains it's 
   fair share of gunfights, explosions and bloody bullet squibs as well 
   as a surprising amount of female nudity (much of it full-frontal), 
   way more than usual for films of this type. The script, by Philip 
   Alderton, is generic war action stuff, but I did like the inclusion 
   of the deeply religious character, Lord, into the mix. It allowed for 
   a couple of unusual sequences, such as when Lord pulls his gun on and 
   threatens to kill a naked gook prostitute when she rubs her naked 
   body on him. He also turns out to be the voice of reason during the 
   final attack set-piece, basically telling the rest of the gang, 
   &quot;Hell, do you want me leading you or do you want the reluctant 
   pothead?&quot; The group picks the pothead. As much as I despise 
   organized religion in general, it's refreshing to watch a film that 
   puts a human face to someone devoted to their god, without pandering 
   or preaching. If you are a fan of war action films, you will probably 
   enjoy this. This is the first film produced by Christopher R. 
   Santiago, Cirio's son. Christoper would go on to produce many of his 
   father's later films. Also starring David Light, Leah Navarro, Don 
   Wilson, Jim Moss, Don Holtz, Greg Rocero, Janet Price and Cory Sperry 
   as Strzalkowski, an in-joke to frequent Santiago collaborator Henry

   who are pinned-down by the enemy in the jungle. Sgt. Stratton fires 
   his pistol in one hand and an AK-47 in the other, Cpl. Leung keeps 
   the enemy at bay with his automatic rifle and Cpl. Ransom shoots his 
   Winchester rifle from the hip. All three of them are crack shots, 
   kill all the VC and lead the American soldiers to a waiting

   Company C, laying waste to all the buildings and killing all the 
   American soldiers stationed there. Col. Stark (Mike Monty) and Capt.

   to kill enemy Col. Trang (Vic Diaz) as he is traveling by train 
   through the mountains. The trio sneak on-board the train, kill Trang

   when, for some reason, Capt. Carter never picks them up by

When the trio get back to headquarters, they <A HREF="eye_of_the_eagle_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eye of the eagle vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>make
    sure to voice their displeasure to Carter and then get into a bar 
   fight with Sgt. Maddox (David Light) and his men (who were supposed 
   to back them up on the last mission) when someone calls Leung a 
   &quot;gook&quot;. Meanwhile, journalist Chris Chandler (Cec Verrell; <B><A HREF="#Silk1986">SILK</A></B> 
   - 1986) has discovered the secret location of the &quot;Lost 
   Command&quot;, a squad of rogue soldiers that are officially listed 
   as AWOL or MIA, commanded by, you guessed it, Sgt. B.O. Rattner. When 
   Chandler is discovered taking photos of the secret location, Rattner 
   orders his men to kill her and get the film. That's not going to be 
   easy, because Chandler's assistant, Lol Pot (Tony Beso), is also the 
   leader of a local tribe of spear and bow-carrying freedom fighters. 
   When Chandler makes it back to her base camp, she manages to get one 
   radio message out before Rattner and his men appear to destroy the 
   camp. Chandler is saved, but loses her camera and the film. When 
   Stratton finds out that Rattner is involved, he has Chandler lead 
   him, Ransom and Leung to the location of the Lost Command. You see, 
   it turns out that Rattner murdered Stratton's brother years earlier 
   and it's payback time. It looks like it's going to be a hot time in 
   the old jungle tonight, especially after it's revealed that Capt. 
   Carter is in cahoots with Rattner. When Rattner kidnaps and tortures 
   Ransom, Stratton and Chandler race to the Lost Command headquarters 
   to save him. Will they get there in time?&nbsp; I'm not going to 
   pretend that this film is nothing but a low-budget <B>PLATOON</B> 
   (1986) rip-off, but it's still damn entertaining. Director/producer 
   Cirio H. Santiago, working with a script by frequent Santiago 
   collaborators Joseph Zucchero and Nigel Hogge, has fashioned a 
   fast-paced, mindless actioner that's basically a non-stop series of 
   action set-pieces connected by the barest of plots. Brett Clark is 
   stiff as a piece of one inch-thick plywood and Robert Patrick, who 
   would appear as the same character in Santiago's next Nam film, <B><A HREF="action.htm#BehindEnemyLines87">BEHIND
    ENEMY LINES</A></B> (1987), only this time as the lead, mugs for the 
   camera and screams out his lines. Luckily, we don't watch these films 
   for the acting talent and Santiago doesn't disappoint when it comes 
   to the carnage. People are shot in the head (our trio's preferred 
   method of disposing of the enemy), blown-up or riddled with automatic 
   gunfire and Santiago also includes a shot of a man on fire, a 
   recurring gag in nearly all his films. I'm still trying to figure out 
   why Ransom dresses like a Southern rebel from the Civil War and why 
   he was allowed to bring a Winchester rifle and a Colt pistol to 
   Vietnam, but I suppose it's best not to dwell on such matters. 
   Unfortunately, Cec Verrell keeps her clothes on throughout, but 
   there's a brief shot of a topless prostitute during the bar fight. If

   that people in our own government are the ones involved, but don't 
   try to think about it too hard, because you'll end up with a 
   migraine. We watch Nelson (Robert Dryer; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Savage Streets">SAVAGE
    STREETS</A></B> - 1984) and his men pull off the next armory heist, 
   only this time Nelson begins killing military personnel when they 
   recognize him. The heist turns into a massacre when both sides shoot 
   it out. Nelson is now wanted by the U.S. Government after they find 
   out he has turned rogue and is stealing arms for his own purposes, 
   rather than for his own government (there goes that damn migraine 
   again!). Corrupt Army Colonel Harper (Kaz Garas; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#FinalMission1984">FINAL
    MISSION</A></B> - 1984) must find and kill Nelson before the press 
   gets hold of the story that Harper hired him to rob our own armories 
   (Where's my Tylenol?). Nelson ends up in the small, secluded 
   California town of Granite Lake, where the entire police force 
   consists of Sheriff Jack Steiger (Rick Hill; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#DuneWarriors">DUNE
    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1990) and Deputy Cowboy Phelps (Morgan 
   Strickland). The town's crooked wheeler-dealer, Rupert Jessup (Ken

   selling the stolen weapons to the highest bidders, as soon as they 
   build a secret airstrip in the forest. Too bad Nelson picked this

    Sheriff Jack is a crack shot, as we witness him shooting three 
   violent drug runners right between the eyes and then blows-up their 
   attacking helicopter with just three shots of his pistol. He's also 
   pretty good with his hands, too, as we later watch him beat the crap

   force when he saw his partner shot in the head (he still has 
   nightmares about it) and moved to this small town to get away from 
   the action and violence. Bad move. It's not long before Jack and 
   Nelson are butting heads, but both Jessup and money-hungry (but 
   clueless) Mayor Ankers (Anthony East) interfere with Jack's duty as 
   sheriff. One night, a bunch of Nelson's men break Jack's gun hand 
   with a two-by-four, pour booze down his throat (Jack is a recovering 
   alcoholic) and then loot the town. Mayor Ankers fires Jack for being 
   drunk on duty, but when Colonel Harper shows up in town and he spots 
   Nelson's men kidnapping Cowboy, Jack and Harper join forces to free 
   Cowboy and bring Nelson and Jessup down. When Cowboy dies in a manner 
   similar to Jack's old partner, Jack goes on a one-man killing spree 
   to get revenge. He's no longer a cop, so all the rules go out the 
   window. Pray for the bad guys, especially in the unbelievable final 
   scene where Jack blows up a huge cargo plane with just three shots of 
   his sidearm!&nbsp; This is another one of prolific Filipino 
   director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's many 80's action films. While 
   nothing spectacular, <B>FAST GUN</B> does move at a fast clip and, 
   besides some gaping plot holes (How does Jack's hand manage to heal 
   so fast?), it manages to keep you entertained through it's short 76 
   minute running time. Since this film doesn't try to break any new 
   ground (it's strikingly similar to Santiago's <B><A HREF="#Devastator">THE

   [1985], which also starred Rick Hill and Kaz Garas), it depends more 
   on action set-pieces rather than plot. Scripters (and long-time 
   Santiago collaborators) Joe Mari Avellana and Frederick Bailey never 
   even try to explain why our own government is stealing weapons from 
   their own armories (I racked my brain for an explanation and all I 
   got was a splitting headache). Instead, they just layer-on one 
   gunfight or car chase after another until we get to the conclusion, 
   where the entire town of Granite Lake is destroyed one building at a 
   time, as Jack, Harper and Julie battle the never-ending supply of 
   Nelson's goons (including Santiago regular Nick Nicholson), who are 
   armed with automatic weapons and rocket launchers. If you have ever 
   watched a Santiago film, you know he excels when it comes to action 
   sequences. This is just like most of Santiago's 80's output: Take off 
   your thinking caps and just enjoy the mindless violence. Ed Carlin,

   and he is forced to parachute into the Vietnam jungle. While VC 
   soldiers are nipping at Major Wilson's heels, General Corman (David

   (Henry Strzalkowski), Jimmy-T (Don Barnes), Senator (Scott Utley) and 
   Jeff (Tonichi Fructoso) to rescue Major Wilson before he is captured 
   and reveals government secrets. General Corman sends his aide, Lt. 
   Reynolds (David Anthony Smith), a wise-ass fighter pilot, to assist 
   Sgt. Duncan on the mission. The enemy sends a special force, led by 
   Captain Phat (Joe Mari Avellana), who had a previous run-in with Sgt. 
   Duncan and his men (Duncan killed a General that Phat was 
   protecting), to capture Major Wilson before he is rescued. The enemy 
   also seems to have knowledge of Sgt. Duncan's arrival in the jungle, 
   like someone on our side is passing them information. This makes it 
   very difficult for Sgt. Duncan's squad, who rescue an injured Major 
   Wilson, but are dogged at every step by Captain Phat and his 
   black-clad special forces. It also doesn't help that Lt. Reynolds is 
   a major fuck-up, who at one point wears <A HREF="field_of_fire_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/field of fire vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>mirrored
    sunglasses while walking through the jungle. This alerts the enemy 
   on their position when they see the rays of the sun reflected off the 
   mirrored lenses. With bad weather on the way that make rescue by 
   helicopter impossible, Sgt. Duncan and his men must traverse the 
   jungle on foot until they get to the next pick-up point miles away. 
   That's easier said than done, because Major Wilson is developing a 
   case of &quot;jungle rot&quot; in his leg wound and it's obvious that 
   someone is sabotaging their every move, as supplies in their 
   backpacks end up missing and their radio is tampered with. With every 
   battle that Duncan and his men engage in, they lose another member. 
   General Corman becomes highly suspicious of Duncan's unlikely series 
   of misfortunes and roots-out the traitor, who is not a member of the 
   trapped squad, but a member of his own staff. The finale finds 
   Duncan, Reynolds and Senator, the only squad members left alive, 
   trying to protect Major Wilson while Captain Phat and his special 
   forces lead one final all-out assault. Can General Corman save them 
   in time?&nbsp; This is director Cirio H. Santiago's first in a series 
   of 90's Vietnam War action films, following a string of 80's war 
   actioners, which included <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#EyeOfTheEagle">EYE

    EXPENDABLES</A></B> (1988) and <B><A HREF="#NamAngels">NAM ANGELS</A></B> 
   (1988). If you enjoyed any of those films, you'll probably like this 
   one, too. The script, by Thomas McKelvey Cleaver (Santiago's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#DuneWarriors">DUNE
    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1990; also starring David Carradine), is 
   basically nothing but a series of action set-pieces, where Duncan and 
   his squad get in numerous firefights, objects and people blow up real 
   good and so many enemy soldiers are stabbed, it's hard to keep count. 
   That's not to say that the film is not without humor, though. There's 
   a funny bit in the beginning where Duncan's squad gross-out a bunch 
   of wet-behind-the-ears new recruits by eating a box-full of enemy 
   &quot;ears&quot; (they're actually canned peaches), only to have 
   Duncan stroll by and accidentally eat the real stunt ear (it's quite 
   funny) and this touching bit of dialogue that Duncan delivers to his 
   squad when member Hawk is killed: &quot;You guys just remember one 
   thing. Hawk bought it because he was showing off. Now I don't want 
   any more of you guys dying on me, you understand? Because I take that 
   shit personal......Now get over here and eat your lizard!&quot; Even 
   though David Carradine is top-billed, he appears for less than five 
   minutes throughout the film, but then he shows up in the finale and 
   plays a major role in saving Duncan, Reynolds and Wilson. You at 
   first think that Carradine is doing one of his patented B-movie 
   walk-on roles, but he actually plays the action hero in the end, 
   jumping out of helicopters and laying down ground fire so everyone 
   can escape. His character, General Corman, is an in-joke to Roger 
   Corman, who bankrolled the majority of Santiago's films, including 
   this one. If you like war films with more braun than brains, <B>FIELD 
   OF FIRE</B> should fit the bill nicely. Other Santiago 90's Nam films

    While Morelli and McGee establish themselves as heads of a criminal 
   empire in Los Angeles, Russell washes-up on-shore on an uncharted 
   island occupied by two Japanese soldiers (Joe Mari Avellana and 
   Joonie Gamboa) that have been stranded there since World War II. They

   Meanwhile, back in the States, McGee moves in on Russell's wife Jayne 
   (Jayne Kennedy) and young son Jimmy (played by James Iglehart's

   interferes in her life, getting her fired from her job as a lounge

   path throughout L.A. trying to wrestle control of all the organized 
   crime activity. Russell is eventually rescued by some American 
   soldiers and he returns to L.A. to look for his wife, but he finds

   knowing that it is Russell who is killing their men (they still think 
   he is dead), Morelli and McGee hire some outside muscle to fix their 
   problem. Russell finally finds his wife and when he sets eyes on his 
   young son for the first time, he puts his revenge plans on hold just 
   long enough to make sweet love to his wife and play with his son in 
   the park. Russell then gets back to work, killing the outside muscle, 
   cutting off Morelli's head and delivering it to McGee (who is missing 
   an ear, thanks to an earlier run-in with Russell) in a box. McGee 
   retaliates by kidnapping Jayne and Jimmy and bringing them to his 
   heavily-guarded house in Mexico. Russell shows up, chops-off a few 
   heads and slices into McGee's stomach with his samurai sword in the

    the top-lined star here. There is fun to be had, especially the 
   interaction between the two Japanese soldiers, who have been living 
   alone together for so long on the island, they act more like an old 
   married couple rather than soldiers. When Russell suddenly appears on 
   the beach, you can see the jealousy in the eyes of the less-dominate 
   soldier (Gamboa). When he accidentally dies after falling out of a 
   coconut tree, you can view the hurt in the face of his long-standing 
   partner (Avellana). When Russell gets rescued, the lone Japanese 
   soldier chooses to stay behind (he even manages to kill one of the 
   American soldiers in rememberance of the good old days) rather than 
   face the new world. This section of the film is my favorite, as the 
   rest of the film is standard gangster and revenge stuff. The first 
   section of the film details the exploits of Morelli and McGee, as 
   they slaughter a mob hangout with machinegun fire and then kill a mob 
   bigshot and his men in an auto junkyard. The final third of the film 
   is Russell's revenge spree. He slices and kicks his way through a 
   cast of stuntmen until he gets even with Morelli and McGee. This 
   contains all the regular Santiago trademarks: Bloody bullet squibs, 
   numerous martial arts fights and a touch of gore, including Morelli's 
   head in a box and a few pretty good decapitations in the finale. 
   Jayne Kennedy also has a brief nude scene and delivers the film's 
   best line. When McGee offers to be Jimmy's new daddy, she looks at 
   him and says, &quot;He don't need a mother like you to be his 
   father!&quot; Both Carmine Argenziano (Santiago's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Naked Vengeance">NAKED

   there haven't been some real dogs to sit through, though. Thankfully, <B>FINAL
    MISSION</B> isn't one of those dogs. It's cheesy fun from beginning 
   to end. The film opens with Sergeant Vincent Deacon (Richard Young) 
   leading his men in an assault on a Vietcong camp in the jungles of 
   Laos in 1972. After gunning nearly everyone down and blowing 
   everything up (even chopping-off a head or two), Sgt. Deacon captures 
   the traitorous Will Slater (John Dresden) and turns him over to the 
   military authorities. Slater curses at Deacon, telling him that he 
   will &quot;see him in Hell&quot; as he is being led away. Cut to 
   present day (well, 1984) Los Angeles. Vince Deacon is now a SWAT team 
   leader and we watch him nearly single-handedly take on a warehouse 
   full of armed thugs (one of them is portrayed by an uncredited Donald 
   Gibbs, &quot;Ogre&quot; in <B><A HREF="revenge_of_the_nerds_1984.htm">REVENGE
    OF THE NERDS</A></B> - 1984) and saves the hostage inside. Deacon 
   also has a beautiful wife, Jenny (Christine L. Tudor), and a young 
   son named Steven (E. Danny Murphy). When a street gang, egged-on by 
   Slater (who escaped from military prison and has been living on the 
   lam), break into Deacon's house and try to kill him and his family, 
   Deacon manages to kill most of them, which infuriates Slater. To show 
   his appreciation, Deacon's captain suspends him from the force for 
   being &quot;excessive&quot; (What?). Deacon and his family decide to 
   spend his suspension time by camping at a lake in the mountains, 
   where Deacon can clear his head, go fishing and reconnect with his 
   family. Things take a sudden bad turn when Jenny and Steven are 
   killed when the fishing boat they are on explodes, thanks to a bomb 
   Slater placed there the night before. Now a widower, Deacon goes on a 
   one-man mission to find the killers of his family, tearing-up bars 
   and shoving patrons' heads in toilets looking for clues. Deacon quits 
   the police force for good and begins putting heat on the street 
   gangs. Slater and some gang members leave L.A. and hide out in the 
   small town of Pinesville, where the sheriff, Warren Slater (Kaz 
   Garas), happens to be Slater's brother. Deacon goes to his old 
   commanding officer, Colonel Joshua Cain (John Ericson), with a piece 
   of the detonator he found at the scene of his family's death. When it 
   comes back that it could only have come from Slater, Deacon heads to 
   Pinesville for some well-deserved justice. Something tells me that

    This is just one in a long line of action films churned-out by 
   prolific Filipino vet Cirio H. Santiago (<B><A HREF="action.htm#TNT Jackson">T.N.T.
    JACKSON</A></B> - 1975; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Future Hunters">FUTURE
    HUNTERS</A></B> - 1986; <B><A HREF="action.htm#RaidersOfTheSun">RAIDERS
    OF THE SUN</A></B> - 1991). Santiago directed many rip-offs during 
   the 80's, but he always found a way to put his distinct signature on 
   them. This one opens as a straight war actioner, then turns into an 
   urban crime drama, which then turns into a revenge melodrama. The 
   final twenty minutes are lifted almost directly from <B>FIRST BLOOD</B>,
    as Deacon lays waste to the town of Pinesville and then Sheriff 
   Warren and his posse hunt him down in the forest, with disasterous 
   results. There's boobytraps, do-it-yourself bullet removal (followed 
   by a &quot;cauterizing the wound with a flaming log&quot; scene) and, 
   finally, the National Guard are called in. Unlike Rambo, Deacon 
   begins killing everyone who crosses his path. Colonel Trautman, er, 
   Cain is brought in to talk Deacon into giving up. Let's just say the 
   final shot leaves no room for a sequel. What's interesting about <B><A HREF="final_mission_1984c.htm">FINAL
    MISSION</A></B> is the way Santiago treats some of his characters, 
   especially Kaz Garas' (he was also in Santiago's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Naked Vengeance">NAKED
    VENGEANCE</A></B> [1985], amongst others) portrayal of Sheriff 
   Warren Slater. He is a man in the middle, not aware of his brother's 
   traitorous war record and yet, deep down inside, he knows his brother

   (script by Joe Mari Avellana and Joseph Zucchero, frequent Santiago 
   collaborators) and Santiago doesn't skimp on the nudity (every woman 
   in this film has a topless scene), blood or action set-pieces. Sure,

   enjoyable one. Santiago directed <B><A HREF="#Devastator">THE DEVASTATOR</A></B>

    Susie is well-versed in the martial arts, because wave after wave of

   is so smitten he ignores Erik's warnings. Meanwhile, Susie bones-up 
   on her martial arts skills by having Rey's Master teach her a new 
   fighting technique using two wooden sticks. She also begins following 
   Chuck as he goes about his daily illegal routine, but she is urged to 
   stop following him by a police detective (Tony Ferrer; Weng Weng's 
   Chief in <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#ForYurHeightOnly">FOR Y'UR

   and she is eventually captured by Grip, who questions her using a 
   poisonous cobra as &quot;truth serum&quot;, but she escapes (and 
   throws the cobra in Grip's face!). After many close calls, where 
   Susie must fight numerous battles, the police discover Bonnie's

   (where, in a lovemaking scene directly from the Twilight Zone, he 
   cuts off all her clothes with knives and she reciprocates!). The 
   loving doesn't last very long, though, as Susie soon discovers that 
   Chuck killed Bonnie on Erik's orders (She seems to be the only one 
   who didn't know this fact!). Susie goes on a mission of revenge and, 
   before the film is done, she will face Chuck in the &quot;Arena of

   Erik and his thugs while Susie deals with Chuck in the ring. Chuck 
   loses his life (and his eyes!) when Susie finally picks up her two 
   sticks and uses them as Rey's Master taught her.&nbsp; While nothing 
   more than a series of lively martial arts sequences held together by 
   the flimsiest of plots, <A HREF="firecracker_1981.htm"><B>FIRECRACKER</B></A> 
   (also known as <B><A HREF="naked_fist_1981.htm">NAKED FIST</A></B>)

   become repetitive. The beautiful Jillian Kesner, who died in 2007 of

   as the high-kicking heroine who manages to survive fight after fight 
   to get her revenge. Her standout scene comes when she fights two guys 
   in a lumber warehouse and keeps losing articles of her clothing until 
   she is topless, wearing nothing but panties. This is also the films 
   bloodiest sequence, as we witness a warehouse guard knocked to the 
   ground and impaled on a scythe, while one of the fighters purposely 
   steps on his body, forcing the blade to bloodily thrust out his chest 
   and one of the fighters falling head-first onto the spinning blade of 
   a circular saw until his skull is cut in half right between the eyes. 
   Chuck's death in the finale is (if you pardon the pun) also an 
   eye-opener. No one ever accused Cirio H. Santiago of making 
   high-concept, thought-provoking films, but, damn, he sure made 
   entertaining ones with plenty of eye candy. Santiago would remake the

   (1992) -</B> Here's a war action flick from Filipino 
   director/producer Cirio H. Santiago that tries to be different. 
   During the Vietnam War, hardened chopper pilot Stewart (Martin Kove; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Miner's Massacre">MINER'S
    MASSACRE</A></B> - 2002) and his crew, co-pilot Jimmy (James

    AMERICA</A></B> - 1990) and Bates (Vic Trevino) are ordered to 
   escort field doctor Davis (Terrence &quot;TC&quot; Carson) and his 
   assistant Li (Ronald Asinas) as they tend to wounded American 
   soldiers behind enemy lines. During one mission, which turns out to 
   be an enemy trap, Stewart endangers everyone's lives when he turns 
   his chopper around to get one more shot at the enemy. Jimmy is 
   seriously wounded by enemy fire and when they get back to base camp, 
   Davis complains to his superiors about Stewart's behavior, but they 
   do nothing about it. As a matter of fact, they brush-off Davis' 
   complaints as if they mean less than squat. On their next mission, 
   Stewart gets a cryptic mayday message on his radio by someone in a 
   plane that mentions the codeword &quot;Firehawk&quot;, some sort of 
   top secret project that shouldn't be mentioned over the airwaves. A 
   short time later, the chopper develops engine trouble and it crashes 
   in the jungle, stranding Stewart, Tex, Bates, Davis, Li and new 
   recruit Hobbs (Jeff Yonis, who also wrote the screenplay), Jimmy's 
   replacement, behind enemy lines. <A HREF="firehawk_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/firehawk vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Stewart
    checks the chopper's engine and notices that someone messed with the 
   fuel line so the engine would quit working in mid-flight. It's not 
   long before the squad begins turning on themselves, accusing each 
   other of being a saboteur and a traitor. When incriminating evidence 
   is found in Li's backpack, Stewart shoots him in the back several 
   times, even if it's plain to see to the viewers that the evidence was 
   planted. The five remaining squad members try to make it to safety, 
   but every move they make seems to be the wrong one, as if someone is 
   reporting their movements to the enemy. As members of the squad start 
   getting wounded, they start wondering why there is no rescue mission 
   (even Jimmy, back at base camp, is wondering the same thing) and 
   Davis begins questioning Stewart's map-reading skills because they 
   seem to be heading in the wrong direction. The questions remain: What 
   does all this have to do with the plane code-named 
   &quot;Firehawk&quot;? What exactly is Firehawk anyway? Who sabotaged 
   the chopper? I'm afraid you're going to have to watch the film to get 
   those answers.&nbsp; This is an above average war action/mystery 
   film, thanks to a more literate script than usual for films of this 
   type, good acting from a recognizable B-movie cast and some good 
   action set-pieces. Some reviewers have likened this film to a jungle 
   version of <B><A HREF="cube_1997.htm">CUBE</A></B> (1997), where 
   people with different personalities must work together to survive 
   circumstances beyond their control. While I wouldn't go that far,

   being led around like puppets and each person must use their separate 
   talents to help the group survive. Unlike <B>C</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">UBE</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">,

   - 1987), the demand for this type of film was beginning to dry-up 
   during the early part of the 90's, partly due to an over-saturated 
   home video market and partly due to cheap DTV action flicks being 
   made in Canada. This is probably Santiago's best film of the 90's. 
   There's plenty of gunfire and explosions, some gore (I liked the 
   scene of a screaming wounded soldier passing by his dismembered leg, 
   lying on the ground, as he is being carried to a waiting helicopter) 
   and some palpable tension generated in some scenes. Hey, this isn't 
   Shakespeare, but it's a good little actioner with much to recommend. 
   Santiago is a much-respected director in his native Philippines. 
   Though some of his films can be classified as tough to sit through 
   and boring, he has proven himself to be a highly-competant director 
   on many occasions. He has directed and/or produced almost 100 films 
   (so far; his last directorial effort was 2005's <B><A HREF="bloodfist_2050_2005.htm">BLOODFIST
    2050</A></B>) and I am a fan, but I am also very easy to please. 
   Most of Santiago's films must be viewed with a forgiving heart, but <B>FIREHAWK</B> 
   isn't one of those films. Also starring Henry Strzalkowski, Richard 
   Curtis, Jim Moss, Rafael Soques and a cameo by frequent Santiago 
   collaborator Joseph Zucchero, who is also this film's Editor).

   they shared three weeks earlier is now occupied by another couple and 
   when she goes to see him at his place of business, his secretary 
   tells Andrea that she hasn't heard from him in weeks, but that's not 
   unusual for him. Andrea is followed and then attacked by a Chinese 
   man dressed in black, but she beats him up with some awkward kung-fu 
   moves. Dave and Toby try to have a good time in Hong Kong while 
   trying to avoid Toby's meddlesome and disapproving mother (a job 
   easier said than done), Sherry is kidnapped by Hong Kong drug dealers 
   and Andrea makes a new friend in importer Rick Shaw (Leo Martinez). 
   When Sherry doesn't show up for her flight to Tokyo the next morning, 
   Toby and Andrea incredibly leave without her. Once in Tokyo (and 
   after making love to Rick Shaw), Andrea goes to a Japanese garden to 
   meet Donald, only to be attacked by two martial artists, which she 
   beats up with the help of a blind man with a dart-firing cane! We 
   then learn why Sherry was kidnapped. It seems she is a drug mule 
   along with boyfriend Bill (Cole Mallard), but this time she only 
   delivered half of her shipment and her bosses want the other half. 
   Meanwhile, Dave and Toby are still trying to get some alone time, but 
   Mama doesn't want her daughter popping her cherry with Dave (Yeah, 
   Toby really is a virgin!). All the stories come together when Rick 
   Shaw (Get it? Rickshaw?) confesses to Andrea that he's a British 
   agent trying to bring down Donald, who is actually the head of a drug 
   and white slavery cartel that Sherry was working for. Andrea agrees 
   to work with Rick Shaw to bring down Donald and rescue Sherry. Toby's 
   interfering mother accidentally gets herself and Toby mixed-up in a 
   white slavery auction, where Dave rescues Toby and her mother and 
   Andrea and Rick Shaw bring down Donald and save Sherry.&nbsp; 
   Although too much stuff goes on in such a short running time (72 
   minutes), director Cirio H. Santiago makes the most of Miller Drake's (<B><A HREF="invasion_earth_the_aliens_are_here_1988.htm">INVASION
    EARTH: THE ALIENS ARE HERE</A></B> - 1988) jumbled screenplay, 
   tossing in plentiful topless female nudity, a dollop of martial arts 
   (kung fu sequences directed by David Chow), a couple of bloody 
   shootouts, some comedy and, of course, plenty of softcore sex scenes. 
   This is just a breezy, quick-moving little exploitationer that 
   delivers what it promises: naked women, action and a multi-tiered 
   story that ties-up nicely in the finale. They just don't make 'em 
   like this anymore and after directing <B><A HREF="cover_girl_models_1975.htm">COVER

   elements. Joe Dante gets an early screen credit here as Dialogue 
   Director, as does Jonathan Demme, who is credited with the confusing

    island of Correbalas, only to discover that the Japs were expecting 
   them. After watching all his comrades being viciously slaughtered (by 
   gunshot, bayonette or, in one extreme case, beheaded [it goes by so 
   quickly, you'll need to replay the scene frame-by-frame to get the 
   full effect]), Paco barely escapes with his life. A stubborn American 
   general (an extended cameo by Ken Metcalfe; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomanHunt1972">THE
    WOMAN HUNT</A></B> - 1972) wants to capture that stronghold at any 
   cost (he even threatens to send his second-in-command to the island 
   if he doesn't come up with a viable solution quickly), so Colonel 
   Blake (Joseph Zucchero; <B><A HREF="#Silk1986">SILK</A></B> - 1986) 
   orders Major &quot;Stony&quot; Stonewell (John Ericson; <B><A HREF="#FinalMission1984">FINAL
    MISSION</A></B> - 1984) to find a way to sneak onto the island and 
   kill some important Japanese generals and admirals that will be 
   visiting the stronghold soon. At first, Stony and Paco are stymied on 
   how to infiltrate the island, but when an Australian woman beats the 
   crap out of both of them in a bar fight, they come up with the 
   brilliant idea to use &quot;broads&quot; to pretend to be prostitutes 
   and make their way to the island as concubines for the visiting 
   Japanese dignitaries (everyone knows how those Japs love their white 
   women!). With the help of Lt. Jennifer West (Karen Ericson; John's 
   real-life wife), Stony and Paco pick four women: death row inmate 
   Rose (Nory Wright), terminally ill Anna (Johanna Raunio), rape victim 
   Sonya (Lisa Lorena) and prostitute Cindy Lee (Lynda Sinclaire), to 
   &quot;volunteer&quot; for the mission. First the women have to be 
   trained in the finer arts of combat (both weapons and hand-to-hand) 
   and how to be high-class hookers (Cindy Lee has the upper hand here 
   and offers to show the rest how it's done). After the girls go 
   through extensive combat and prostitute training, Colonel Blake 
   (insert <B><A HREF="mash_tv_series_1972-1983.htm">M*A*S*H</A></B>

   (&quot;Women cannot overpower men!&quot;), so he talks the General 
   into calling the mission off. The girls change the General's mind 
   when they single-handedly overpower all the men on the base 
   (including a very embarrassed Colonel Blake), leaving them tied-up in 
   their beds. The women and Paco then leave their base in Australia and 
   parachute onto the island, where Paco and his freedom fighters assist 
   the four women into joining a brothel run by Madam Colleen, which is 
   frequented by the Japanese occupied forces. The girls are im<A HREF="hustler_squad_1976b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hustler squad vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>mediately
    picked by the horny Japs and are taken to the stronghold, where they 
   go to a party and each are assigned as a concubine to their own 
   visiting Japanese dignitary (Anna ends up in the bedroom of an 
   understanding, Harvard-educated Japanese Admiral and Rose, the 
   horniest of the bunch, ends up with a Nip General who prematurely 
   ejaculates!). In the finale, the girls begin killing their targets on 
   the inside while Paco and his freedom fighters stage a major assault 
   from the outside. When the smoke clears, only the terminally ill Anna 
   survives, as the rest of the women and Paco die in a hail of bullets. 
   Oh, the irony of war!&nbsp; For a Filipino action flick, <B><A HREF="hustler_squad_1976.htm">HUSTLER
    SQUAD</A></B> is pretty slow-moving and uneventful except for the 
   violent beginning minutes and the final twenty minutes, where the 
   girls perform their mission. What happens in-between is pretty 
   standard stuff, as we get to know Stony, Paco and the women, view 
   their strenuous training regimen and watch various romantic 
   interludes, especially between Stony &amp; Jennifer and Paco &amp; 
   Anna. For a film that is so female-eccentric and full of sex talk, 
   there is very little female nudity on view. Even during the 
   prostitute training sessions, the women wear big white bras and 
   granny panties, so those looking for a lot of lurid female flesh are 
   bound to be disappointed. The violence on display is of the standard 
   bullet squib and knife-stabbing variety, but I get the feeling that 
   some of the more violent aspects of this film (including two 
   decapitations) have been severely edited. Director Cesar Gallardo (<B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#BambooGodsIronMen">BAMBOO
    GODS AND IRON MEN</A></B> - 1974) tries his best, but the screenplay 
   (which goes uncredited, but it has Ken Metcalfe's signature moves 
   written all over it) takes far too long to get to the action. There 
   are some interesting aspects here, especially the relationship 
   between Paco and the slowly dying Anna and the fatalistic finale, but 
   there's way too much dead air for the viewer to really get 
   emotionally involved. Also known as <B><A HREF="commander_stonewell_1976.htm">COMMANDER

   break it up, but ends up knocked out after he kills one of the 
   rapists. When he wakes up, he has a bloody knife in his hand and the

   useless and to prove his point, he shows them the half-eaten corpse 
   of a prisoner that tried to escape, only to end up as shark bait. 
   Almost immediately, Merill is attacked in the shower, but he manages 
   to fight them off. Merill is put in a cell with wise, old Uncle Coronad<A HREF="live_by_the_fist_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/live by the fist vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>o
    (George Takei), a long-timer who takes Merill under his wing. He'll 
   need the help, because a lot of people in the joint want him dead, 
   including Alvarez (Romy Diaz), who was friends with the rapist Merill 
   killed. Alvarez has his Asian inmates attack Merill constantly, so 
   Warden Acosta assigns Merill to the all-white motorpool, run by white 
   supremacist Sacker (Ted Markland). When Merill saves a gook prisoner 
   from the wrath of Sacker and fellow missing-tooth mate Greasemonkey 
   (Nick Nicholson), he also becomes enemies with the white population. 
   Uncle Coronado tells Merill that Warden Acosta and his right-hand man 
   Vargas (Roland Dantes) are under investigation by a group called 
   Human Rights International, headed by Helen Ferris (Laura Albert). It 
   seems there have been 29 deaths in the prison in the last two years 
   and one of Uncle Coronado's friends stole a ledger that proves that 
   the Warden is stealing funds from the prison, but his friend was 
   killed before he told Coronado where he hid it. If Merill can find 
   the ledger and turn it over to Ms. Ferris when she arrives in one 
   week's time, he stands a good chance of being freed. Merill 
   eventually finds the ledger, but the Warden tries his best to kill 
   him before he has the chance of putting the ledger in Ms. Ferris' 
   hands. Good thing Merill is a champion martial artist, because both 
   the white and Asian prisoners assault him on a daily basis. Can Uncle 
   Coronado unite all the prisoners before a full-blown race riot breaks 
   out? It looks pretty grim when the Warden gets Sacker and Alvarez to 
   start a riot just as Ms. Ferris arrives at the prison, but Merill 
   steps in and dishes-out some much-deserved justice to all the guilty 
   parties just in the nick of time.&nbsp; This is the first of Filipino 
   director Cirio H. Santiago's trio of actioners he made with non-actor 
   Jerry &quot;Golden Boy&quot; Trimble in the early 90's , the others 
   being <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#OneManArmy">ONE MAN ARMY</A></B> 
   (1993) and <B><A HREF="#Stranglehold1994">STRANGLEHOLD</A></B> 
   (1994). Trimble is a terrible actor, but he is a decent martial 
   artist. He still gets hit more than any martial artist I have ever 
   seen in films (see if Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme would 
   ever be allowed to take so many punches to the face and body as 
   Trimble does here), which at least makes his character much more 
   vunerable than you would normally see in these B-films. <B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR
    TREK</A></B>'s Mr. Sulu, George Takei, is the &quot;name&quot; actor 
   here and his character is the same type of person that was patented 
   so well by the late Mako in many films; namely, a wise, sage old man 
   who is the voice of reason. Takei is fine here, but I especially 
   liked the performance of Filipino staple Vic Diaz as Warden Acosta. 
   This is one of his biggest roles in the latter part of his career and 
   he's appropriately slimey as a man with no morals. <B>LIVE BY THE FIST</B>

   slowly becomes friends with Kelly and secretly begins helping Kelly 
   and Angie escape, especially after they unsucessfully try to escape 
   on their own and end up in a hot box (not to mention getting Kelly's 
   adoptive father killed when he tries to help them escape). As if

   the dreaded pirate Turko (John Montgomery), is on the warpath and is 
   killing all their friends and associates on the outside as he tries 
   to find out their location. When Sandra is recaptured and killed, 
   Kelly makes it her mission to make sure Montiero pays for it with his 
   life. Kelly, Angie, Marcie and Serena escape from the plantation 
   (Marcie is bitten on the breast by a cobra during the escape and 
   Serena sucks out the poison), but it all turns out to be a set-up by 
   Serena and Montiero. The girls still manage to escape and hook-up 
   with their pirate crew, where they get into a gun battle with 
   Montiero and his guards. When Turko and his crew suddenly appear, 
   it's a free-for-all that many will not survive.&nbsp; This strange 
   mixture of WIP (women in prison) and pirate themes comes courtesy of 
   Filipino director/producer Cirio H. Santiago and, quite frankly, it 
   doesn't make for a good mix. For a film that spends much of it's time 
   at an all-female coffee plantation/prison, there is precious little 
   nudity (just an all-too-quick prerequisite shower scene when the 
   girls arrive at the plantation). What we do get is plenty of scenes 
   where our two heroines get into lots of hinky martial arts fights and 
   it's rather obvious that stunt doubles were utilized most of the 
   time. There's also far more dialogue than usual for a Santiago film 
   (script by Cyril St. James, from a story by Santiago, who uses the 
   pseudonym &quot;Leonard Hermes&quot;) and precious little action. 
   While it is a pleasure to watch four beautiful actresses play off of 
   each other, Santiago never fully takes advantage of putting them in 
   truly exploitative situations, like long naked showers, catfights 
   and, most importantly, long naked showers. While the final gun battle 
   is violent (Jayne Kennedy's death on a suspension bridge is 
   memorable), it takes forever to get there (the film's running time of 
   82 minutes seems twice as long). I get the feeling that Santiago was 
   slumming here, as he really doesn't seem to have his heart in this 
   film. This film just rambles along and is full of so many missed 
   opportunities (like long naked showers), I just wanted to cry. I 
   expected more from Mr. Santiago. With this exceptional cast of 
   beautiful actresses, he should have made a gem of an exploitationer.

   state and she is brought to the hospital. The local sheriff (Bill 
   McLaughlin, who walks around with an expression on his face like he

   that 35mm elements of the Unrated Version seem to be lost since the 
   only place on the entire planet where the Unrated Version was

   manipulation) and Hickman and actually begin to operate as a team. 
   Things turn bad when Chard captures the three Angels, but Calhoun and 
   Hickman save their asses, along with Calhoun's two captive squad 
   members. The Angels abandon their gold quest and instead fight 
   alongside Calhoun as they battle Chard and his bloodthirsty natives. 
   The finale finds our unlikely heroes trying to make it across a 
   rickety, broken wooden bridge, while Chard, the natives and even the 
   VC (who show up with tanks!) try their damnedest to make sure they 
   don't make it across to the other side.&nbsp; If you've seen any of 
   director Cirio H. Santiago's other Nam action flicks, such as <B><A HREF="#EyeOfTheEagle">EYE
    OF THE EAGLE</A></B> (1987), <B><A HREF="action.htm#BehindEnemyLines87">BEHIND

   what to expect here: Lots of gunfights, explosions galore, gore 
   (including the aforementioned arm removal, slit throats and arrows 
   through the neck), some brief nudity and, of course, Santiago's 
   patented &quot;running man on fire&quot; gag. This one also contains 
   plenty of motorcycle stunts and some unexpected humor, such as when 
   the remaining Angels stand over Turko's grave and Calhoun asks them 
   to say a little something out of respect. The best they can come up 
   with is when member Bonelli (Mark Venturini) thanks Turko for making 
   the surviving members shares of gold a little larger! An interesting 
   side note is that when the real Hell's Angels heard that this film 
   used their name without permission, they successfully sued and won a 
   fairly large cash settlement. It didn't help that Rick Dean's 
   character was named &quot;Sonny Larger&quot;, which sounded too much 
   like the name of real Hell's Angels founder Sonny Barger to be a 
   coincidence. <B><A HREF="nam_angels_1989.htm">NAM ANGELS</A></B>

    MAN ARMY</A><A NAME="OneManArmy"></A> (1993) -</B> When interest in 
   his post-nuke and Vietnam War actioners began to wane in the early 
   90's, director/producer Cirio H. Santiago switched to making 
   modern-day martial arts flicks. Unfortunately, these films are 
   Santiago's most anemic, thanks to ever-shrinking budgets and a severe 
   lack of star power, especially in his choice of leading actors. This 
   is one of the worst of the bunch. Martial arts teacher Jerry Pelt 
   (Jerry Trimble) is called back to his hometown to attend the funeral 
   of his judge grandfather. As soon as he enters his birthplace, he 
   notices that the town has changed (for one, it's now full of Filipino 
   extras) and it's not for the better. Jerry hooks-up with old 
   girlfriend Natalie Pierce (Melissa Moore; Santiago's <B><A HREF="angel_fist_1993.htm">ANGELFIST</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> </FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">-
    1992), who informs him that the town has been taken over by a man 
   named Sidney Sharperson (Paul Holmes), who has ties to organized 
   crime and smuggles illegal aliens into the country to work for slave 
   wages in his fields. Jerry finds evidence that his grandfather may 
   have been murdered for discovering the illegal alien smuggling 
   operation, so he sets out to find definite proof. It doesn't help 
   that the corrupt sheriff, Pat Boze (the late Rick Dean; Santiago's <B><A HREF="action.htm#RaidersOfTheSun">RAIDERS
    OF THE SUN</A></B> - 1991), is a childhood enemy of Jerry's, who 
   dogs his every move. When Natalie, who is a lawyer, suggests that 
   Jerry runs for sherif<A HREF="one_man_army_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/one man army vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>f,
    he initially rejects the idea, but after a series of deadly 
   &quot;accidents&quot; in town, Jerry decides that running for sheriff 
   is probably just what this county needs. Natalie is shot and wounded 
   by a couple of motorcycle helmet-wearing thugs while taking a topless 
   dip in a lake with Jerry (who are now lovers again), so Jerry, along 
   with his grandfather's intelligent German Shepherd &quot;Hank&quot; 
   (played by &quot;Yup&quot;, who shows a wider range of emotions than 
   the leading man), begin to tear the town apart looking for the 
   shooters as well as picking up support from the townspeople who are 
   sick and tired of all the corruption. When Sharperson tries to bribe 
   Jerry, Natalie secretly records the conversation and has a radio DJ 
   (Henry Strzalkowski) broadcast it. Thanks to the recording, Jerry 
   easily wins the election and, with childhood pal Eddie Taylor (Dennis 
   Hayden), begins cleaning up the town. Eddie, it turns out, is not 
   such a good friend after all, as he's a coke addict and is on Boze's 
   payroll. Eddie kills his wife Pilar (Yvonne Michelle) in a coked-out 
   haze, knocks-out Jerry and sets the house on fire. Thinking Jerry is 
   dead (He's not. Hank drags him out of the burning house.), Eddie 
   takes over as sheriff and brings Boze and the other corrupt cops back 
   on the payroll. When Jerry finds out that it was Eddie who killed his 
   grandfather, he goes on a one-man murder spree, killing everyone 
   (including Boze, who shoots Sharperson in the back for slapping him 
   in the face one too many times) until only he and Eddie (who has 
   kidnapped Natalie) are left.&nbsp; The first thing you'll notice 
   about this film is how one-note champion kickboxer Jerry Trimble is 
   as an actor (Trimble has the fastest kick ever recorded, clocked at 
   118 mph). Trimble is simply terrible and has the emotional range of a 
   rock, which makes me wonder why director Santiago used him as the 
   star of two other films, 1992's <B><A HREF="live_by_the_fist_1993.htm">LIVE
    BY THE FIST</A></B> and 1994's <B><A HREF="stranglehold_1994.htm">STRANGLEHOLD</A></B>.
    The second thing you'll notice about the film is how many times 
   Trimble gets hit in the face every time he gets into a fight. For 
   someone so proficient in the martial arts, he certainly takes more 
   than his fair share of the punishment. I'm still trying to figure out 
   if that's a good or bad thing. Santiago tries to keep our minds off 
   the film's gaping plot holes by tossing as much female nudity at us 
   as possible (Melissa Moore has several nude scenes, as do most of the 
   women here), but the sad fact is that Trimble (who is married to 
   actress Ami Dolenz [<B><A HREF="ticks_1993.htm">TICKS</A></B> - 1993; <B><A HREF="pumpkinhead_2_blood_wings_1994.htm">PUMPKINHEAD
    II: BLOOD WINGS</A></B> - 1994]) is not able to hold up his end as 
   an actor and the normally wild Rick Dean (Santiago's <B><A HREF="#NamAngels">NAM
    ANGELS</A></B> - 1988; <B><A HREF="naked_obsession_1990.htm">NAKED OBSESSION</A></B> 
   - 1990) is much too subdued here.<B> </B>The only humor comes when 
   Jerry and Eddie go to break-up an illegal martial arts tournament in 
   one of Sharperson's bars, only to find a bingo tournament instead, 
   thanks to the traitorous Eddie tipping-off Sharperson in advance. The 
   fight scenes are fairly lively and somewhat bloody but, all-in-all, 
   this action flick is average at best, thanks to Trimble's 
   non-existant thespian talents. As with most of Santiago's films, this 
   was financed by Roger Corman and clocks in at a scant 79 minutes.

    Brodie and Talbot save Sierra (Lani Lobangco) from the clutches of 
   two mutants, when Brodie discovers that she is a native of a 
   legendary place called the &quot;Gate To The Sun&quot;, where

   at the next town. Talbot will go undercover in Hoghead's gang looking 
   for his wife and Brodie and Sierra will go to her village where 
   Brodie can collect some gunpowder and bring it back to headquarters. 
   With the help of a group of dwarves (a recurring theme in nearly all 
   of Santiago's post-nuke films) from Sierra's village, Brodie (who is 
   injured protecting the little people) and Sierra make it to the 
   village. Hoghead and his gang go to the Captain's headquarters, where

   Colonel Clay makes it to Sierra's village and Brodie and the 
   villagers must protect the village's huge potassium mine from the 
   invading forces. The finale finds Brodie (who has fallen in love with 
   Sierra) fighting arch-nemesis Coloney Clay in hand-to-hand combat and 
   Talbot and a freed Vera battling Hoghead (who actually wears a hat 
   made from a hog's head!). When Sierra ends up dead by Colonel Clay's

   Haygood (James Iglehart of Santiago's <B><A HREF="#FightingMad1978">FIGHTING

   - 1986; <B><A HREF="#LiveByTheFist">LIVE BY THE FIST</A></B> - 1992), 
   it leads to a series of events where Vicki is captured and tortured 
   (with an electric prod to her vagina) by the government and Jim and 
   Amanda escape, only to be captured by the rebel guerillas when their 
   jeep runs out of gas. Jim proves beneficial to the rebels' cause when 
   he saves their ass by diverting enemy fire (he radios-in to the Army 
   and has them shell their own troops!), so the rebels accept him and 
   Amanda into the fold. The first thing they do is break Vicki and 
   rebel leader Flores (Eddie Guitierrez) out of prison while disguised 
   as firemen. Flores and female rebel leader China (Aura Aurea) are 
   still a little reticent in trusting Jim, but his vast military 
   experience and street smarts soon wins them over. Eventually, Jim 
   becomes a leader of the rebels and devises a plan to capture the 
   Minister of Defense, but a traitor in their ranks may spell doom for 
   the rebel movement. The finale takes place at a radio station, where 
   a pirate broadcast goes out to all the citizens exposing government 
   corruption, while Jim and the rebels defend the station until the 
   broadcast is complete. The traitor, along with some good guys and 
   gals, are killed in the ensuing battle, but the rebels live on to 
   fight another day.&nbsp; This mixture of action and exploitation 
   elements gels quite nicely under Santiago's steady hand. There's a 
   ton of nudity on view (even some full-frontal), as well as plenty of 
   gunfights, explosions and even a dollop of gore. The script, by Ed 
   Medard (possibly a pseudonym for Santiago), also has plenty of 
   political and racial intrigue, as it seems to compare the rebels' 
   plight in the Philippines with that of the Civil Rights movement in 
   America. James Iglehart (who also starred in the Santiago-produced <B><A HREF="#BambooGodsIronMen">BAMBOO
    GODS AND IRON MEN</A></B> [1974]) does a good job here as an angry 
   black man (the Filipino government even goes as far as to label him a 
   &quot;black savage&quot;) who shares a lot in common with the rebels 
   and teaches them techniques he learned back on the mean streets of 
   America. Santiago, whose other 70's films include <B><A HREF="#FlyMe1973">FLY

   action and political intrigue with numerous scenes of female nudity 
   and nearly every woman in the cast gets the chance to display their 
   assets. Not everything about this film is taken seriously, though, as 
   there are a few comical scenes, such as when Vicki interrogates an 
   enemy soldier with her knife-throwing talents or when Vic Diaz gets a 
   phone call in mid-cunnilingus from Ken Metcalfe. This is also the 
   earliest example of Santiago using his trademark &quot;man on

   detective Jenny 'Silk' Sleighton (Monique Gabrielle, replacing the 
   original film's Cec Verrell) and partner Sgt. Chris Meadows (Bon 
   Vibar) are first seen assaulting a group of Palestine terrorists that 
   have taken over the Israeli Embassy in Honolulu, Hawaii. When one of 
   the terrorists shoots one of their hostages in the back of the head 
   (we see the bullet exit out of the front of the head, blowing out the 
   poor guy's eye socket), Silk and Chris enter the building and quickly 
   kill the terrorists (Silk's weapon of choice is a sawed-off shotgun) 
   before any more hostages are harmed. Crooked museum owner Hancock 
   Gish (Jan Merlin) sets up a fake robbery where he has his men switch 
   a briefcase containing the &quot;Four Scrolls Of The Temple Of 
   Immortality&quot;, valuable ancient Japanese artifacts that were 
   supposed to be on loan to Gish's museum. Gish hangs the four phoney 
   scrolls in his museum thinking no one will be the wiser (he intends

    the originals and collecting the insurance money when he has the 
   fake ones destroyed in an explosion), but when art expert Tony (Peter 
   Nelson) spots them as fakes, the shit hits the fan. Tony calls 
   Japanese art collector Kashi Hashimura (Joe Mari Avellana) and tells 
   him about the fakes. Kashi contacts his old friend Chris, tells him 
   about the fake scrolls and asks Chris to investigate. Chris, who is 
   about to retire from the force, begins digging into the theft on his 
   own time and nearly gets killed by two of Gish's goons, Trent (Robert 
   Ginnivan) and Dodge (Jim Moss).&nbsp; Chris needs help, so he informs 
   Silk what is going on and they follow Trent and Dodge onto a boat, 
   where Chris is wounded and taken prisoner and Chris has to jump 
   overboard to escape, but not before she grabs one of the real 
   scrolls. Silk's superior, Captain Henry Sharp (Ken Metcalfe), tells 
   her that she is off the case, but we know better, don't we? When one 
   of Gish's goons tries to kill Silk while she is taking a shower, she 
   is forced to kill him (Gratuitous exposed breasts kung-fu alert!). 
   When an exchange of Chris for the scroll goes horribly wrong and 
   Chris is stabbed to death by Trent, Silk grants Chris' dying request 
   and travels to the island of Kona to return the scroll to Kashi, 
   where she meets Tony and a young woman named Holly (Maria Claire), 
   who will both play an important role in Silk's life in the next few 
   days. Trent and Dodge try their best to kill Silk and retrieve the 
   scroll, but she is always on the ball. Gish kidnaps Tony and Kashi in 
   the finale and plans to blow them up, along with his museum and the 
   fake scrolls and collect his insurance money, framing Tony and Kashi 
   as terrorists. Silk and Holly show up in the nick of time and save 
   the day, retrieving the real scrolls, rescuing Tony and killing 
   Trent, while Kashi restrains Gish as they both blow up in the 
   explosion.&nbsp; Those expecting the same fun experience as the first 
   film are bound to be disappointed because returning director Cirio H. 
   Santiago cast the wrong woman in the leading role. Monique Gabrielle (<B><A HREF="angel_eyes_1993.htm">ANGEL
    EYES</A></B> - 1993) may look great naked (she has a couple of nude 
   scenes, including a really blurry slow-motion sex scene with Tony), 
   but she's not much of an actress. Her monotone line readings are 
   simply awful and hamper the film's overall effectiveness. She's a 
   major distraction. Santiago offers a bit of major gore in the 
   beginning of the film, but unfortunately fails to follow through, as 
   the rest of the film is relatively blood-free and predictable (script 
   by Robert King, who also wrote the screenplays to the creepy horror 
   film <B><A HREF="nest.htm">THE NEST</A></B> [1988] and the martial 
   arts actioner <B><A HREF="bloodfist_1989.htm">BLOODFIST</A></B> 
   [1989]). While there are a few gunfights, martial arts sequences and 
   car chases, it by no means measures-up to Santiago's usual action 
   standards. Even the big explosion in the finale is an obvious 
   miniature and there is a severe shortage of Santiago's usual 
   overabundant use of bloody bullet squibs. This 76 minute flick is 
   pretty terrible and I am usually very forgiving when it comes to 
   Santiago's films. Skip this and watch the original instead. Also

   battles, chases and explosions with the barest of plots to hold it 
   all together. Two women, Alee (Rebecca Holden) and Vera (Barbara

   Sisterhood, travel on horseback through the scorched

    They are one their way to free their fellow Sisters from 
   imprisonment by the evil Lord Kragg (Kenneth Peerless), who is 
   holding them in a dungeon and plans on using them for world 
   domination. You see, each member of the Sisterhood has a magical 
   power, like the ability to shoot laser beams from their eyes or heal 
   wounds with the touch of a hand, so Lord Kragg figures on using their 
   powers to defeat all the other nomadic tribes on Earth. Alee and Vera 
   are being followed by warrior Mikal (Chuck Wagner) and his men. Mikal 
   wants Vera, since she has the power to heal. With her by his side, he 
   cannot be killed in any battle he's in. Mikal and his raiders destroy 
   a village and he kills the young brother of stablegirl Marya 
   (Lynn-Holly Johnson), who has the ability to speak with her pet hawk. 
   Marya joins forces with Alee and Vera and she swears to get even with 
   Mikal for her brother's death. As the female trio are on their way to 
   free the Sisterhood, Vera is captured by Mikal, so Alee and Marya 
   work together to rescue her. Mikal and his men bring Vera to a camp 
   run by the evil Lord Jak (Anthony East), where Mikal joins forces 
   with Jak and his men. Alee and Marya have a run-in with a caravan led 
   by Lord Barak (Robert Dryer), but Barak turns out not to be such a 
   bad guy and everyone settles their differences amicably. Alee and 
   Marya then run into a tribe of horribly-scarred scarred mutants and, 
   as they are fleeing from the mutant horde, they find a cave that 
   contains a bunker full of automatic weapons, explosives and an 
   armored vehicle that has been sitting there before the &quot;Great 
   War&quot; between the United States and Russia (talk about a stroke 
   of good luck!). Alee and Marya use their new wealth of goodies to 
   first free Vera and then head-off to save the rest of the Sisterhood. 
   As the trio storms the village where the Sisterhood is being held 
   captive, Mikal discovers that one of them is actually his sister! The 
   mystical female goddess of the Sisterhood appears in the finale to 
   unshackle all the women and transport them to safety, away from the 
   cold hands of the male population. Mikal follows them on his chopper, 
   the only man who has the Sisterhood's best interest at heart (I guess 
   Marya has given up on making him pay for her brother's death. Maybe 
   she just forgot.).&nbsp; Yes, this is another of prolific Filipino 
   director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's 80's post-nuke flicks <A HREF="sisterhood_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sisterhood dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(which

   - 1986) and, yes, it doesn't make a lick of sense but, damn, it sure 
   is entertaining in an absurd, brain-dead sort of way. Santiago 
   creates his own future Earth where spears, swords and horses co-exist 
   with guns, rocket launchers and armored personnel carriers. Each has 
   their place in this futuristic society and each has their advantage. 
   Unlike most post-nuke films (including the remainder of Santiago's), 
   this one doesn't concern itself with oil or water or a lack thereof. <B><A HREF="sisterhood_1988.htm">THE
    SISTERHOOD</A></B> is about a battle of the sexes. In this future 
   society, women fall into two distinct categories: They are either sex 
   slaves or strong-willed, independent individuals. No gray areas here; 
   everything is either black or white. Of course, this being a Santiago 
   film, both types of women spend a lot of time in various states of 
   undress, except for the chaste Lynn-Holly Johnson (<B><A HREF="alien_predators_1984.htm">ALIEN
    PREDATORS</A></B> - 1984), who never seems to take her clothes off 
   in any film she's in (I'm beginning to think she's actually a man!). 
   Robert Dryer (Santiago's <B><A HREF="action.htm#FastGun">FAST GUN</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="action.htm#BehindEnemyLines87">BEHIND ENEMY LINES</A></B> 
   [both 1987]) takes the prize here as the weirdest character. His Lord 
   Barak speaks with a Boris Karloff-like lisp, which makes him seem 
   like a bad guy but, as we soon find out, he's a very reasonable man. 
   I also like the twisted logic used here (script by Thomas McKelvey 
   Cleaver, screenwriter of other Santiago epics like <B><A HREF="#DuneWarriors">DUNE
    WARRIORS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="#FieldOfFire">FIELD OF FIRE</A></B> 
   [both 1990]), especially concerning Mikal. Even though he murders 
   innocent people (including Marya's pre-teen brother), he's allowed to 
   live in the finale based solely on the revelation that Alee is his 
   sister. Innocent victims be damned! Santiago also offers some gore 
   (swordplay violence, various slashings and impalements and a hand 
   being lopped-off), lots of explosions and two of his trademarks: 
   pygmie cannibals and his patented &quot;running man on fire&quot; 
   gag. In other words, your typical Santiago action flick. If you like 
   his other films, you're bound to like this one, too. Also starring 
   the usual Santiago regulars: Henry Strzalkowski, David Light, Jim

   - 2007) lost his son Kevin when he was shot down while flying a 
   mission over Vietnam in 1965. Pendleton never gave up hope that his 
   son is still alive, so he hires a guy named Sid Friedkin (Michael 
   Vlastas) to train a bunch of mercenaries on his Hawaiian estate to 
   rescue his son if he is still alive (they stage a phony raid on a 
   fake POW camp, using illegal immigrants as the VC and firing live 
   rounds, killing them all!). To milk even more money out of Pendleton, 
   conniving Friedman hires junkie Jeffrey Stokes (Derek Williams) to 
   pretend to be a rescued POW (he is actually an Army deserter) that 
   spent time in the same prison camp as Kevin, falsely verifying to 
   Pendleton that his son is still alive. Pendleton falls for the ruse 
   hook, line and sinker and gives carte blanche to Friedkin to spend 
   whatever it takes for a rescue attempt. The only problem is that 
   Jeffrey figures out that he's about to be murdered by Friedkin's

   shoot-out, Stokes is shot in the leg and Spyder tosses a crooked 
   ambassador's son off the roof of a highrise building. After being 
   chewed-out by his Captain (John Dulaney), Spyder heads to Stokes' 
   house, only to find out from his wife Nancy (Meski Gelahun) that he 
   is heading to Hawaii after getting a frantic phone call from Jeffrey, 
   who everyone thought died in Vietnam. Spyder catches up with his 
   partner at the airport, but Lee tells him to mind his own business. 
   We know that's not gonna happen. Jeffrey is being hunted down by 
   Friedkin's head goon Ed Skinner (Gary Rooney), who kills both Jeffrey 
   and Lee in a hotel room shootout and plants half a kilo of heroin in 
   Lee's room to make it look like a drug deal gone wrong. Of course, 
   Spyder doesn't buy it and heads to Hawaii, where he has to deal with 
   hard-ass Police Chief Bill Akida (a badly-dubbed Vic Diaz), who makes 
   Spyder's investigation more difficult than it has to be. Friendly 
   uniform cop Ted Kanaka (Henry Strzalkowski) helps Spyder in his 
   investigation, which leads him to Jeffrey's drug dealer Weasel (Louie 
   Del Castillo), who informs Spyder (after some &quot;friendly&quot; 
   persuasion) that all roads lead to Roderick Pendleton. Spyder 
   confronts Pendleton and his daughter Karen (Roxanne Baird) and learns 
   to whole sordid story about Kevin. As Spyder starts piecing the 
   puzzle together, attempts are made on his life (Kanaka is killed by a 
   bomb planted in Spyder's hotel room) and he is nearly killed by 
   Skinner. Spyder joins forces with Karen when her father is kidnapped 
   by Friedkin and Skinner and held for $5 million in ransom. In the 
   finale, Spyder and Skinner have a bare-knuckle fight to the death, 
   while Friedkin shoots it out with the cops after callously killing 
   Karen. With nothing left to live for, Pendleton flies a helicopter 
   into a building, killing Friedkin and putting an end to this whole 
   sordid affair.&nbsp; This is a fast-paced, but horrifically acted, 
   Filipino actioner, Executive Produced by the late Cirio H. Santiago 
   (his son Christopher was Associate Producer here) and directed by 
   frequent Santiago actor/collaborator Joe Mari Avellana (<B><A HREF="action.htm#FistOfGlory">FIST
    OF GLORY</A></B> - 1991). The action scenes are well-choreographed 
   and bloody (especially the hotel shootout), but the film is nearly 
   ruined by the non-acting talents of Blake Bahner (a martial 
   artist-turned-actor who had a very short film career) and Roxanne 
   Baird, who are just simply awful (They keep stepping on everyone's 
   lines and the dialogue scenes have a &quot;one-take&quot; feel). The

   - 1992), is fairly complex for a cheap actioner, but the lead actors 
   are unable to pull it off convincingly. While watching this film, a 
   severe case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu overwhelmed me, until I realized 
   that I already saw much of this footage in a later film called <B><A HREF="blackbelt_2_fatal_force_1993.htm">BLACK

   Corman (in true cost-cutting fashion), <B>BBII</B> is nothing but a 
   slightly-edited version of <B>SPYDER</B> (which never had a U.S. home

   is a violent, blood-soaked film, but, technically, it is very sloppy, 
   as are the production values. This has the look and feel of a porn

   many more people. The rest of the film details Cooper's numerous 
   battles with Richter's men and, finally, with Richter himself, as he 
   tries to stop the nerve gas from being dispensed. Cooper must also 
   rescue the Congresswoman again when it is revealed that William 
   Atkins is actually on Richter's team. After blowing up the Chemco

   artist/non-actor Jerry &quot;Golden Boy&quot; Trimble (<B><A HREF="live_by_the_fist_1993.htm">LIVE
    BY THE FIST</A></B> [1992] and <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#OneManArmy">ONE
    MAN ARMY</A></B> [1993] being the other two) and it is definitely 
   the worst of the trio. While the other two were nothing to write home 
   about, <B>STRANGLEHOLD</B> is a tepid affair at best and the fact 
   that it took three people (Mark Evan Schwartz, Brendan Broderick and 
   Rob Kerchner) to write the generic screenplay speaks volumes on how 
   desperate this film really is. It's nothing but a series of 
   badly-staged gun battles, martial arts fights and chases, none of 
   them particularly exciting or bloody. It's pretty clear that at this 
   stage in his career, director Santiago was running on fumes and 
   delivers a film that lacks any vibrancy or life. It didn't help that 
   Roger Corman, who financed the majority of Santiago's films, forced 
   Santiago to make this film on a budget that wouldn't feed a hungry 
   family at dinnertime. Most of the film takes place at either the same 
   boiler room set (filmed at different angles) or at a boardroom where 
   the American government representatives (including Santiago staples 
   Ken Metcalfe and Henry Strzalkowski) endlessly discuss what to do 
   about Richter and his demands (They, of course, end up doing nothing 
   and only serve to pad out the film's paltry running time). We all 
   know how bad Jerry Trimble is as an actor (he also looks like he 
   packed on a few pounds since <B>ONE MAN ARMY</B>), but the usually 
   reliable Vernon Wells is simply horrible here and looks like he's 
   coke-out or high on meth. This is quite possibly Santiago's worst 
   film ever and even though it's only 73 minutes long, it's a chore to 
   sit through. A total dud from start to finish. Santiago would go on 
   to direct only a handful of films after this (2005's <B><A HREF="bloodfist_2050_2005.htm">BLOODFIST

   Sadly, Cirio H. Santiago passed away in 2008 and his last film, <B>WATER
    WARS</B> (co-directed by Jim Wynorski when Santiago passed away in 
   the middle of filming), is still looking for a U.S. home video 
   distributor. Word is, that as the films stands right now, it is 
   unsalable (From what I heard, lead actor Michael Madsen looks drunk 
   as a skunk throughout the entire film and the different styles 
   between the two directors is highly obvious). When even Roger Corman 
   can't sell a film, you know there has to be serious problems with it, 
   but eventually everything makes it to home video.</FONT></FONT></P>

   After the final nuclear holocaust, the Earth is a dry, scorched shell 
   and water is in short supply (Why does this sound so familiar?). 
   Whoever controls the water controls the world. Lone wolf Stryker 
   (Steve Sandor; <B><A HREF="trained_to_kill_usa_1973.htm">TRAINED TO 
   KILL U.S.A.</A></B> - 1973) saves a young woman named Delha (Andrea 
   Savio) from a pack of bandits, who are after her body and something 
   more important (more on that later). She pays Stryker back by 
   stealing his <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">ROAD WARRIOR</A></B>-inspired
    car and taking off without him. He travels on foot with new pal 
   Bandit (William Ostrander; <B><A HREF="red_heat_1985.htm">RED HEAT</A></B> 
   - 1985), who was sent to retrieve Delha and bring her back to Trun 
   (Ken Metcalfe; <B><A HREF="action.htm#FastGun">FAST GUN</A></B> - 
   1987). After giving water to a tribe of dwarves, Stryker and Bandit 
   catch up with Delha (Stryker has a gas shut-off switch in his car), 
   only to watch her being taken away by the men commanded by the evil 
   Kardis (Michael Lane; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Code Name Zebra">CODE 
   NAME: ZEBRA</A></B> - 1986). It seems Kardis and Stryker have a 
   history, as flashbacks reveal that Kardis killed Stryker's wife years 
   earlier. Stryker was able to get some payback by chopping off Kardis' 
   left hand (he now sports a stylish hook in place of his hand), but 
   Kardis escaped before Stryker could finish him off. Delha knows the 
   secret location of an underground spring full of potable water and 
   both bad guy Kardis and good guy Trun would like to know where it is. 
   Stryker and Bandit steal one of Kardis' water<A HREF="stryker_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stryker vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   trucks and use it as a diversion to sneak into Kardis' compound. 
   Kardis, who's compound is running out of water (He cuts back on water 
   rations to his own men and completely cuts-off rations to his 
   wounded, declaring, &quot;Water is only for those that are 
   productive!&quot;), tortures Delha for the location of the water 
   (three of his men strip and rape her), but before she can say 
   anything, Stryker and Bandit save her and escape. This, of course, 
   pisses-off Kardis to no end. Stryker and Bandit take Delha to Trun's 
   camp (Turns out Trun and Stryker are brothers), but when they get 
   there, they find that Trun has been kidnapped by Kardis' men (we 
   watch one of Kardis' henchmen, played by an uncredited Nick 
   Nicholson, piss on Trun's face as he's buried up to his neck in the 
   sand). Stryker and Bandit lead a raid on the remote outpost and not 
   only save Trun, they also save the tribe of dwarves we met earlier in 
   the film and get some unexpected help from a tribe of 
   crossbow-weilding female Amazons. The Amazons are actually protecting 
   the secret spring (which is located in a remote cave) and once Delha 
   tells Trun where it is, he turns out not to be so different from 
   Kardis. Trun and his men rule the cave with an iron fist, much to the 
   chagrin of Stryker (Who says to Trun, &quot;You have a mirror in your 
   mind. I think you should look in it!&quot;), who leaves in disgust. 
   When Kardis attacks the cave, he captures a departing Stryker and 
   puts the hurt on him really bad. The dwarves appear to rescue Stryker 
   and they all return to the cave for a final battle. When the battle 
   is over, God rewards the winners by making it rain for the first time 
   since the nuclear bombs fell. God is funny sometimes.&nbsp; This is 
   the first of Filipino director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's many 
   post-nuke films and it is probably his best. Other films in 
   Santiago's post-apocalyptic palette include <B><A HREF="#WheelsOfFire">WHEELS

   substitute water for oil), but Santiago tosses-in so many chases, 
   gunfights, martial arts fights and nudity, you can't help but be 
   entertained. Santiago also supplies more gore than usual, including 
   decapitations, dismemberments, slashings, bloody bullet squibs and 
   some splattery gunshots to the head. There is also a slight attempt 
   to give Stryker an emotional core. When Stryker watches the three 
   goons raping Delha, he flashes back to his wife's rape/decapitation 
   and he loses it, punching one of the rapists in the face until all 
   that's left is a bloody pulp. When Delha tries to kiss him later on 
   as he leaves the spring, all he can muster for her is a hug, his 
   wife's memory still burned in his brain. Hey, it's not much, but it's 
   more than you usually get in films of this type. Besides, watching a 
   tribe of dwarves (a Santiago trademark) running around with blowguns 
   and talking their own special brand of gibberish is what makes 
   Santiago's films so special. It's outlandish, but he somehow makes it 
   work. Also starring Joseph Zucchero, Julie Gray, John Harris III,

   she knocks Elaine out and takes her captive. She then finds out that 
   Elaine is an undercover government agent who is deep in Sid's 
   operation. Elaine and TNT agree to work together to bring Sid down. 
   Sid sends Ming (Leo Martin) to beat the information out of TNT, but 
   she turns the tables and beats the shit out of Ming and his men 
   (while topless, the film's highlight). When TNT finally learns that 
   Charlie was responsible for her brother's death, she goes on a one

   interfere with Elaine's plan to arrest Sid. Elaine has TNT arrested,

   to TNT to break out of jail and get justice for everyone.&nbsp; 
   Although labelled as blaxploitation, <B><A HREF="tnt_jackson.htm">TNT JACKSON</A></B> 
   really isn't because there are only two black people in the entire 
   film (if you don't count TNT's brother in the beginning). Besides one 
   white woman (Elaine), it comes as no surprise that Filipino director 
   Cirio H. Santiago (who has almost 100 films to his credit, including <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Naked Vengeance">NAKED

   locations. Jeanne Bell (<B><A HREF="lee frost.htm#Policewomen">POLICEWOMEN</A></B> 
   - 1974) is an OK actress (and looks great naked) but it is apparent 
   that in many of the fights scenes a male stunt double in an afro wig 
   was used. The scene where she fights topless is memorable (and was 
   spoofed in Quentin Tarantino's <B><A HREF="jackie_brown_1997.htm">JACKIE
    BROWN</A></B> - 1997), even if the fight choreography is awkward at 
   best. There are a few bloody scenes, especially when TNT puts her 
   fist through Charlie's stomach until it exits out his back, but 
   mostly it's just martial arts fights. The print used for the Dollar 
   DVD release is a total mess. It looks like it had a long life running 
   through projectors as it has plenty of emulsion scratches and is 
   missing quite a few frames during reel changes. It's like you're 
   watching the film at an actual grindhouse, minus the smell of ass and 
   sticky floors. This is a pretty entertaining flick if you can get 
   past the weak martial arts fights. Roger Corman was the uncredited

    Forbes to believe her, she joins forces with Greg (who witnesses the 
   creature killing one of his rubes [played by Filipino staple Ken 
   Metcalfe]) and ocean biologist Dr. Whiting (Charles Howerton) to find 
   a way to stop the monster from killing more innocent people. Mr. 
   Forbes tries his damnedest to keep word of the deaths from reaching 
   the ears of his customers or the press, but that becomes next to 
   impossible when human body parts begin washing ashore. When the 
   creature attacks and kills several more of the resort's tourists, Mr. 
   Forbes offers $1000 and a week's stay in the Presidential Suite to 
   any tourist who bags the creature. Of course, all the tourists 
   automatically disregard the bloody attack the night before and 
   greedily take to the ocean en masse to kill the monster. When the 
   tourists (Many of them too drunk or too stupid beyond believability) 
   prove not up to the task, Greg uses the now-dead Dr. Whiting's body 
   as chum (!) to entice the monster before blowing it up with 
   explosives. Too bad that the viewer couldn't get as swift a death as 
   the creature, because we'll have to keep the images of this film in 
   our brains for the rest of our lives.&nbsp; This horror film, 
   directed by Charles B. Griffith (screenwriter of the cult classic <B><A HREF="little_shop_of_horrors_1960.htm">LITTLE

   new plateau of awfulness. It's a movie that is so shitty, I felt I 
   had to wipe my ass after watching it. Nearly every technical credit 
   is sub-par, including editing that looks to have been performed by 
   someone going through detox, post-synch dubbing that sounds like it 
   was recorded in a closet, and a monster that looks so ridiculous, I 
   can't imagine how anyone in the cast kept a straight face when 
   looking at it (imagine a shark with a couple of extra dorsal fins 
   glued-on to it's body, done with the technical ability of an Ed Wood 
   flick). Maybe it's because the cast realized when they got on set 
   what a crap sandwich they signed themselves onto, as everyone looks 
   and acts like they just got back from a loved one's funeral. The 
   screenplay, by Alfred M. Sweeney (credited to Anne Dyer on posters 
   and ad mats), is just a jumbled mess of horror clich&eacute;s with no 
   connective tissue, as sequences jump from one scene to the next 
   without making any sense. People in this film do the most idiotic 
   things imaginable and I let out an audible groan when all the 
   tourists took to the ocean to kill the creature for a measly thousand 
   bucks and a free week's stay at the resort (even the tourists that 
   were injured the night before!). It's this type of contempt for the 
   audience that makes this film a contender for the worst <B><A HREF="jaws.htm">JAWS</A></B> 
   rip-off of all time (and, yes, I'm taking <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil Fish">DEVIL

   I think it was, but since I didn't laugh, I could very well be wrong. 
   Vic Diaz spends most of his screen time crying (he wants to be a 
   vampire but can't stand the taste of blood), farting (and inhaling 
   the vapors) or chasing our two heroes around a graveyard, while 
   Carradine quotes poetry and the hooker/vampires spout lines like, 
   &quot;It's not murder. It's dinner.&quot; Our two heroes don't fare 
   much better in the dialogue department as they have to speak such 
   cringe-inducing lines like, &quot;That cemetery is full of dead 
   bodies!&quot; (Well, let hope so!). This one-joke film is stretched 
   to an unbearable 80 minutes and, if it weren't for the frequent 
   female nudity on view, I would have turned it off after Diaz's first 
   gas attack. There's also some risable post-sync dubbing (it seems 
   about 50% of the film is dubbed) even though it's plain to see 
   everyone is speaking English. It also has a long orgy scene (where 
   the female vampires keep their panties on) intercut with Carradine 
   killing a rat with a crossbow and making Diaz drink it's blood. The 
   uncredited end title song has lyrics that go, &quot;They're vampire 
   hookers and blood is not all they suck.&quot; That's about as funny 
   as it gets here, folks. This is one of those films that everyone has 
   heard of but few have seen. There is a reason for that. It stinks.

   followers to a better planet, although it's obvious to any sane 
   person that this rocket will never achieve lift-off, especially since 
   parts of it are made out of wood!). Trace leaves everyone behind in 
   the village and sets out to rescue his sister on his own, but he is 
   captured by Scourge and tortured. Stinger, Spike and Mud lead a 
   friendly squad of fighters (who belong to a government group known as 
   &quot;The Ownership&quot;) to save the day, leaving a freed Trace to 
   face-off with Scourge. Not everyone, both good and bad, will make it 
   out alive.&nbsp; This is totally entertaining junk from start to 
   finish. Not only does Santiago offer us non-stop action, gun battles, 
   explosions, car crashes and weird characters, he also has co-star 
   Lynda Wiesmeier go topless for 90% of her screen time. That alone is 
   worth the price of admission. Santiago, whose other 80's post-nuke 
   actioners include <B><A HREF="#Stryker1983">STRYKER</A></B> (1983), <B><A HREF="#Equalizer2000">EQUALIZER
    2000</A></B> (1986) and <B><A HREF="#Sisterhood1987">THE SISTERHOOD</A></B> 
   (1987), never takes frequent collaborator Frederick bailey's 
   clich&eacute;-ridden script too seriously, although there is a scene 
   later in the film where Trace has to watch sister Arlie, who has been 
   raped by nearly all of Scourge's men during her captivity, beg for 
   something to eat from her captors, offering her body for a morsel of 
   food. This is as close to pathos as this film gets, because the 
   remainder of the flick is a series of action set-pieces, where Trace 
   and his new partners get in and out of trouble. Trace likes to burn 
   his victims to a crisp with his portable flame-thrower, giving 
   Santiago ample opportunities to showcase stuntmen running or doing 
   high falls while on fire, one of Santiago's signature trademark moves 
   in nearly every action film he made during the 70's, 80's &amp; 90's.

    OF HELL'S ISLAND</A><A NAME="WomenOfHellsIsland"></A> (1978) -</B> 
   Here's a lesser-known film from the busy Cirio H. Santiago. It's a 
   pretty standard WIP (Women In Prison) flick about a bunch of innocent 
   (and not so innocent) women who are kidnapped and brought to a remote 
   jungle camp where they are stripped, vaginally-inspected and told 
   they will be used as &quot;sexual playthings for the bad guys&quot;. 
   The camp, it turns out, is a training facility for assassins and as 
   the butch camp leader explains to her financiers about the assassins, 
   &quot;They're not robots. Sex is a need, like food.&quot; The new 
   girls are housed in a huge cave where some of the veteran prisoners 
   give them the skinny on their situation. They are enclosed in an 
   electrified fence and surrounded by jungle, which is full of swamps 
   and boobytraps, so escape is next to impossible. Every night, the 
   camp's sadistic warden (Ken Metcalfe), picks certain women to be used 
   for &quot;room service&quot;. They are cleaned-up, injected with an 
   aphrodisiac and taken to &quot;The Resort&quot;, a building that 
   contains rooms with nothing but beds, where they make love to the 
   assassins. If you don't come when the warden calls your number, he 
   simply shoots you point-blank in the chest and picks another woman. 
   The aphrodisiac eventually messes-up the women's nervous system, 
   causing them to go crazy or suicidal (one girl blows her head off 
   with an assassin's pistol and another <A HREF="women_of_hells_island_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/women of hell's island vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>jumps
    out a window to her death), which is why new women are brought to 
   the camp regularly. Three women try to escape, but one is shot in the 
   back, one is blown-up when she steps on a land mine and the last one 
   is recaptured and thrown in a &quot;Hot Box&quot; (a steel box buried 
   in the ground) as punishment. Some of the new girls begin to dig an 
   escape tunnel, but the veteran prisoners tell them that they are 
   wasting their time. Meanwhile, the fiance of one of the newly-kidnapped
    girls, Cindy (Bernadette Williams), puts the heat on the American 
   Embassy to find his girlfriend. That's when we find out that two of 
   the recently abducted women are actually undercover agents, but they 
   have yet to contact their superiors with their location. Some of the 
   veteran prisoners try to force their way out by taking the warden 
   hostage, but it all ends rather badly when all but one, Maggie (Kerry 
   Nichols), are massacred in a hail of automatic gunfire. Maggie is 
   then strung-up and whipped within an inch of her life. The warden 
   then rapes Cindy, but she grabs his knife and slices off his wang. 
   The warden kills Cindy with a couple of bullets to her chest and has 
   the camp doctor re-attach his penis. The finale finds the remainder 
   of the women escaping en mass through the tunnel and trying to make 
   it to a waiting plane, while avoiding enemy fire and a pissed-off 
   warden.&nbsp; Slow-moving and uninvolving, this exploitationer from 
   prolific Filipino director Cirio H. Santiago (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Devastator">THE
    DEVASTATOR</A></B> - 1985; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Silk1986">SILK</A></B> 
   - 1986) is too lethargic for it's own good. The script, by Santiago 
   regular Ken Metcalfe, is full of missed opportunities and gaping plot 
   holes (If you dig a tunnel in the jungle, how far do you have to dig 
   before you make it to safety?) and the film's snail-like pace gives 
   the viewer plenty of time to reflect on the deficiencies. Another 
   major problem is that we know precious little about these women, so 
   it's hard to get emotionally involved in their plight, even when they 
   are killed. All good WIP films give a little backstory to their 
   characters, so we can sympathize with them when they are put in 
   peril. There's none of that here, so when the women are killed 
   (especially the massacre after the warden is taken captive), it's 
   just like watching background characters taking a bullet. There's no 
   resonance. Santiago does throw in a lot of nudity and bits of gore 
   (impalements on spiked boobytraps, bloody bullet squibs, castration), 
   but without someone to identify with, it all rings hollow. That's 
   interesting, because Santiago produced such WIP classics like <B><A HREF="hot_box_1972.htm">THE
