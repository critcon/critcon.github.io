    one of my bouts of insomnia, I turned on the TV and tuned in to HBO 
    and started watching <B><A HREF="sexy_beast_2000.htm">SEXY BEAST</A></B> 
    (2000), a crime caper starring Ray Winstone and a physically and 
    verbally abusive Ben Kingsley, giving the performance of his career. 
    You'll forget that he played Gandhi here. Never in my life have I 
    heard the word &quot;cunt&quot; spew relentlessly out of someone's 
    mouth, as Kingsley does here. He's got not one redeemable quality, as 
    he beats up and shouts obscenities at both men and women at his whim 
    and he enjoys it. When he gets his comeuppance at the end of the 
    film, you actually feel relieved. The final 30 seconds of the film, 
    when Kingsley meets the Devil (literally) is such a gut-busting 
    hilarious scene, that it will leaves you howling with laughter for a 
    long time after. Definitely one of the best endings of any movie in 
    recent years.</FONT></FONT></P>

     draw the line seeing Seagal in one of Albert Pyun's stinkers called <B><A HREF="ticker_2000.htm">TICKER</A></B> 
    (2000), a mess of a film about a serial bomber with a grudge. How 
    Pyun also got Dennis Hopper and Tom Sizemore (the Heidi 
    Fleiss-beater) to star in this mish-mash of a film (that also 
    utilizes portions of seven other action films, including <B><A HREF="warhead_1996.htm">WARHEAD</A></B> 
    [1996], <B><A HREF="peacekeeper_1997.htm">THE PEACEKEEPER</A></B> 
    [1997] and <B><A HREF="octopus_2000.htm">OCTOPUS</A></B> [2000], to 
    pad out the running time) will be a mystery that only Sherlock Holmes 
    could solve. Pyun disappeared after making this film and has not been 
    seen in public, due to problems with financiers that he would rather 
    not see again (or so I've heard). Or maybe Seagal saw the final cut 
    and had some of his CIA buddies stop Pyun from ever making another 
    film. This is absolutely the worst film of Seagal's resume. I just 
    saw Seagal's <B><A HREF="foreigner_2003.htm">THE FOREIGNER</A> </B>(2003)
     on the USA Network and <B><A HREF="out_for_a_kill_2003.htm">OUT FOR 
    A KILL</A></B> (2003) on DVD and they are bad, but not Pyun bad (Both 
    were directed by <B><A HREF="breed_2001.htm">THE BREED</A></B>'s 
    [2001] Michael Oblowitz). He's also been vindicated in the Julius R. 
    Nasso court trial as Mr. Nasso has admitted that he and some Mob 
    buddies tried to shake down Seagal for money for every film he makes. 
    My wife thinks I'm crazy, but I like Steven Seagal as an actor. I 
    always thought that your personal life and professional life should 
    be kept separate, something she cannot comprehend. Who cares if his 
    past is &quot;shady&quot; (or that they Photoshop all the wrinkles 
    off his face on the DVD covers)? I sure don't! Everyone has got a 
    skeleton in their closet if you look close enough. For a visual look 
    at all the recent direct-to-video Seagal films, click <A HREF="steven_seagal_dtv_films.htm">HERE</A>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    (&quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; in <B><A HREF="silence_of_the_lambs_1991.htm">SILENCE
     OF THE LAMBS</A></B> - 1991) as Monk's ex-Captain Stottlemeyer and 
    Jason Gray-Stanford as Lt. Disher, who has a thing for Sharona. This 
    series blows anything away on Network TV. Apparently ABC TV also 
    thought so, and began airing season one repeats in prime-time to 
    decent ratings. I believe this is a first for a Cable TV series to 
    get a showing on Network TV. Usually it's the other way around. The <A HREF="dead_zone_tv2.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dead zone tv series premiere small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="157" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="More great TV!" BORDER="1"></A>other
     series I am also talking about is <B><A HREF="dead_zone_tv_series_2002-2007.htm">THE
     DEAD ZONE</A></B>. It is one of the most intricately plotted TV 
    series on the air today, rivaled, I believe, only by NBC's <B><A HREF="boomtown_tv.htm">BOOMTOWN</A></B>,
     another criminally-overlooked series currently on the air (Which NBC 
    put on &quot;hiatus&quot; after only 2 episodes in its' second 
    season. They wouldn't know quality if it bit them in the ass.). A 
    grown-up Anthony Michael Hall plays Johnny Smith, who comes out of a 
    five-year coma with powers to see the future by just touching a 
    person or object. The transition effects are excellent and the 
    scriptwriters are to be congratulated for turning a one-dimensional 
    premise into a facinating viewing experience. Several episodes are 
    extremely well-made, evoking emotional responses from the viewer that 
    come quite unexpectedly. The one episode when he touches a woman in a 
    bar and sees a beautiful relationship developing (that he desperately 
    needs, since his fiancee married the town's sheriff when he was in 
    the coma) only to be offset by some intrigue which involves her 
    death, leaves a lump in your throat as he has to make the only 
    decision that keeps everyone out of trouble and leaves him all alone 
    again. Stephen King can be proud of this adaptation of <B><A HREF="dead_zone_tv2.htm">THE
     DEAD ZONE</A></B>. These series, along with FX's excellent cop 
    series <B><A HREF="shield_tv_series_2002-2008.htm">THE SHIELD</A></B>,
     make having cable a must. With all the Reality TV crap being 
    spoon-fed to us on a daily basis, it's good to know that some people 
    still know how to produce something of substance and thought.</FONT></FONT></P>

    sick and tired of buying DVDs and then spending the next half hour 
    removing the &quot;security tape&quot; from the three sides of the 
    package. Trying to remove the stickers without ruining the packaging 
    is a losing proposition. Since all DVDs have a security device placed 
    inside the packaging (you know: that little <A HREF="dvd_security_device.htm">black
     or white rectangle</A> glued next to the disk), is there any reason 
    why security tape has to be attached to all three sides? Why not 
    attach it to one side and put it on the outside of the cellophane 
    wrapping? That would make everyone happy. I actually scratched a DVD 
    when trying to remove the sticker from one side as the knife went 
    into the packaging and put a nasty gouge in the disk. <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</A> 
    would not take it back since the package was opened!!! Another 
    instance had me tearing the cover art because the sticker was 
    attached to it. This happened on the <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#House 1000 Corpses">HOUSE
     OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> DVD, which has the worst packaging I have 
    ever seen on a DVD. This shit has to stop.</FONT></FONT></P>

    lot of people have asked me what my favorite films are. Boy, that's a 
    tough one. There are so many films that I enjoy that coming up with a 
    Top 10 List would just make my mind implode. Some films will never be 
    reviewed on this site because they would be considered too 
    &quot;mainstream&quot; or have just been over-reviewed everywhere 
    else. Yes, I admit it: I do watch those blockbusters that are usually 
    cookie-cutter candy for the eyes. Sometimes though, there are some 
    good one out there. I'm a big fan of Michael Bay's <B><A HREF="armageddon_1998.htm">ARMAGEDDON</A></B> 
    (1998). I do find most of Mr. Bay's other efforts to be overblown and 
    overlong, but this one worked for me on an emotional and action 
    level. The critics lambasted it but I found it to be a heart-pounding 
    rollercoaster ride. If you don't cry at the end of this film, you 
    must be a robot or a member of the Taliban. Nobody better diss Bruce 
    Willis around me. I find him to be one of the most diverse actors in 
    films today and I bet 50 years from now, history will bear me out. <B><A HREF="die hard.htm">DIE

     and <B><A HREF="die_hard_2_1990.htm">DIE HARD 2</A></B> (1990) are 
    two of my favorite big-budget action films. But since this is a web 
    site devoted to non-traditional film fare, I will list some of my 
    favorite obscure films and TV shows of all genres in no particular order:</FONT></FONT></P>

    my take on the new TV series premiering for the 2003 - 2004 season: 
    Don't waste your time. Besides the highly-weird and surreal <B><A HREF="carnivale.htm">CARNIVALE</A></B>

    always-welcome Michael J. Anderson), TV pretty much stinks this year. 
    The only slight standouts are the Jerry Bruckheimer 
    executive-produced <B><A HREF="cold_case_tv_series_2003-2010.htm">COLD

    CCR's song <I>&quot;Have You Ever Seen The Rain&quot;</I>&nbsp; which 
    packs and emotional gut-punch in the pilot finale) and the series 
    premiere of <B><A HREF="joan_of_arcadia.htm">JOAN OF ARCADIA</A></B>, 
    starring Russ Tamblyn's talented daughter Amber Tamblyn as teenager 
    Joan who has a direct connection with God, who needs her for some 
    unknown reason and sends her on tasks that she does not understand. 
    It also stars the late John Ritter's son Jason Ritter as Joan's 
    wheelchair-bound brother. While the pilot episode had the outlandish 
    plot going for it, subsequent episodes have been lacking and have 
    turned somewhat preachy. If I want preachy, I'll watch Clancy Brown

    even if my wife hates this film with all her heart for reasons I will 
    never understand), I was actually creeped out by what was shown on 
    the screen of a non-scary nature. As everyone probably knows by now, 
    director Victor Salva is a convicted sex offender (a 13 year-old boy 
    performed oral sex on Salva while he was making his first film <B><A HREF="clownhouse_1988.htm">CLOWNHOUSE</A></B> 
    [1988], the act which Salva videotaped and received 15 months in 
    jail). On this film the camera lovingly lingers on the naked torsos 
    of a suntanning male basketball team, whose bus has broken down in 
    the middle of nowhere, the fodder for the Creeper. I could just 
    imagine Salva getting excited filming these scenes and it made my 
    stomach turn. There's also an extra on the DVD called &quot;A Day In 
    Hell&quot; where the camera follows the extremely overweight Salva on 
    a typical day of shooting the film, hugging his male actors after a 
    particularly tough day of shooting. Ugh! Don't get me wrong. I 
    actually like a lot of Salva's films (his <B><A HREF="nature_of_the_beast_1995.htm">NATURE

    around young boys at all. I know he's served his time and he's 
    probably learned his lesson, but statistics show that sex offenders 
    are 72% more likely to repeat their crimes than any other criminal 
    act. That's why there's a national sex offenders database.</FONT></FONT></P>

    by Richard Robinson that I remember seeing in theaters under the 
    misleading title <B><A HREF="black_vengeance_1974.htm">BLACK VENGEANCE</A> </B>(to
     cash in on the blaxploitation fad at the time). Confused yet? This 
    sleazy little gem concerns a famous black singer (Leslie Uggams) 
    getting stuck in some southern backwater town after her Mercedes 
    breaks down. There she meets Eddie (Michael Christian), alcoholic 
    ex-stripper Shelley Winters (!) and real trouble begins. Eddie is an 
    aspiring singer and recognizes Leslie and takes a shining to her, 
    raping her repeatedly and making her take pictures of him in his 
    Elvis jumpsuit and guitar. Leslie is degraded repeatedly by the 
    townsfolk (including Slim Pickens and Dub Taylor) until a shocking 
    and violent ending where Eddie is shotgunned by Leslie when he tries 
    to marry her with the whole town present. The only problem is that <B>HEARTBREAK
     MOTEL</B> is a total retooling of the original film (probably made 
    for TV consumption since the original film could never be shown on 
    regular TV at the time). It seems that in 1978 director David Worth 
    (who photographed the original and may have helped Robinson direct 
    some scenes) re-edited the film (adding some outtakes from the 
    original film), cut out all the nudity, sex and violence and 
    completely changed the ending. Eddie lives, Leslie escapes and 
    everyone lives happily ever after as if nothing ever happened. 
    Missing is the scene of Eddie raping Leslie while the film intercuts 
    to two dog screwing. The entire shotgun scene is missing and scenes 
    are shuffled around to the point of the film making no sense. All the 
    violence is completely gone, as is the scene where Eddie serves a 
    breakfast made of freshly-butchered dog. Eddie is made to look like a 
    helpless loser rather than the psychopath that he was in the original 
    film. David Worth takes directorial credit and Richard Robinson is 
    credited as &quot;Director of Production&quot;. Avoid this 
    bastardized version at all costs. It's not worth your time and 
    effort. The box to the <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#VidAmerica">VidAmerica</A>

     Things calmed down in the mid-90's and violence was again accepted

     one of the bloodiest R-Rated films ever made but, since it is about

    to freedom of choice? The Bush Administration has time and time again

    you vote. You do vote, don't you? UPDATE: READ THIS - <B>WASHINGTON - 
    Faced with public ire over racy language, explicit scenes and 
    skin-baring outfits, the Senate overwhelmingly agreed on Tuesday 
    (June 22, 2004) to fine radio and television broadcasters and 
    personalities as much as $3 million a day for airing indecent 
    entertainment. After the uproar stoked by Janet Jackson and Justin 
    Timberlake's &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; at this year's Super 
    Bowl, the Senate rushed the bill through on a 99-1 vote without floor 
    debate. GOP Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas said the issue had been 
    debated enough. Lawmakers have continually criticized broadcasters 
    for airing what they say is increasingly coarse programming that can 
    be seen or heard by children. &quot;People are tired of this indecent 
    material on over-the-air public broadcast, particularly during prime 
    time when people's families are watching,&quot; said Brownback, the 
    bill's sponsor. &quot;We're going to have to take action because the 
    broadcasters won't police themselves.&quot; Under the measure, the 
    maximum fine for both broadcasters and entertainers would increase to 
    up to $275,000 per indecent incident, up from $27,500 for license 
    holders and $11,000 for personalities. The fines would keep 
    increasing for each incident until a maximum fine of $3 million a day 
    is reached. The House passed a similar bill that would set fines at 
    $500,000. Differences between the two bills must be worked out. The 
    Senate moved the measure without debate as part of the massive 
    defense bill expected to be approved later this week. The only 
    senator to vote against the measure was Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
    Breaux said he opposed the bill partly because &quot;it deals with 
    communications and media issues and should not have been attached to 
    a national security and defense bill.&quot; Federal law and FCC rules 
    prohibit over-the-air radio and television stations from airing 
    offensive material that refers to sexual and excretory functions 
    between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., hours when children are more likely to be 
    tuned in. No such restrictions exist for cable and satellite TV or 
    satellite radio. The FCC currently has no power to regulate those 
    channels, which are available through subscription to the 85 percent 
    of the 108.4 million U.S. households with televisions. Introduced in 
    January, after FCC Chairman Michael Powell demanded higher fines, the 
    bill wound up on a fast track to passage after the Feb. 1 Super Bowl 
    halftime show that ended with Timberlake partially exposing Jackson's 
    breast for an instant to 90 million viewers. The incident generated 
    more than 500,000 complaints to the FCC. If the legislation isn't 
    approved as part of the bill to authorize spending for the Defense 
    Department, Brownback said he would try to find another way to get it 
    through the Senate. &quot;This is something the public wants,&quot; 
    he said.</B> IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR VOTE DOESN'T COUNT, DOES IT? Unless

    rated PG-13!!!! Why the hell bother? Since all the previous Alien and 
    Predator films have been rated R, this just proves that major film 
    studios are pandering to the mass market to get the most bang for 
    their buck: the teenagers. Now, don't get me wrong, I have nothing 
    against teenagers. I was one once. But when I was one in the 70's I 
    had no problem getting into R-rated films and I had my parents' 
    blessing. Today, it's nearly impossible for a teen to get into an 
    R-rated film without being accompanied by an adult or by having their 
    parent sign a card giving their kid permission to go to one (which 
    some theatre chains now do and I compliment them). I've read recently 
    in the papers that some right-wing group has said that PG-13 films 
    today are the equivalent of R-rated films of the late 80's and early 
    90's. While that may be true (that period of time is when Tipper Gore 
    went on a rampage trying to label everything to &quot;protect our 
    children&quot; and basically succeeded), it does not apply to the 
    R-rated exploitation films of the 70's and early 80's. I'll even bet 
    that if <B>AVP</B> were released in the fall or winter instead of 
    summertime, the film would have been shot to get an R-rating. Let's 
    face it: Summertime is for children and we adults are left out in the 
    cold. We have to wait for them to go back to school to get what we 
    need. MORE BAD NEWS: The <A HREF="alien_vs_predator_dvd.htm">DVD</A> 
    released on 01/25/05 is still the PG-13 rated version. It does have 
    an alternate beginning and some lame deleted scenes, but they are not 
    incorporated in the film and have to be watched separately. C'mon! It 
    must have been shot with some R-rated scenes. Director Paul W.S. 
    Anderson is no stranger to the R territory, directing such films as <B><A HREF="event_horizon_1997.htm">EVENT

    tired of buying a DVD and then a few months to a year later having 
    another edition of the film released. The same thing happened with <B><A HREF="saw_2004.htm">SAW</A></B>.
     It was released in an unrated edition when <B><A HREF="saw_2_2005.htm">SAW
     II</A></B> was released to theaters. Just another way for the huge 
    production companies to squeeze every penny out of a film. I refuse

    getting sick and tired of TV stations squeezing the end credits of 
    series and movies so they can show even more promos. You see it 
    everywhere, as the credits are shrunk on the top half, bottom half, 
    left side or right side of the screen to make way for more inane<A HREF="forgotten_2004.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/forgotten poster small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="155" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
    previews of upcoming shows (that give away vital plot points!). It's 
    even worse when they show movies. The end credits speed by so quickly 
    that they are unreadable. This is a total disservice to all those 
    responsible for putting shows and films together as a cohesive whole. 
    What really gets me riled though, is that pay cable is now doing the 
    same thing. If I'm paying a monthly charge to watch movies &quot;uncut
     and unedited&quot;, I expect to see them that way. I don't want to 
    see station identification logos onscreen (like Showtime does), 
    squeezed end credits (most pay cable stations do this now, but Starz 
    and Encore are the main offenders) or making-of featurettes shown 
    during the end credits (HBO, Starz and Encore). They supposedly do 
    this to &quot;stop illegal distribution of copyrighted films&quot;, 
    but come'on: Do the sins of the few have to affect the many? This is 
    corporate greed, plain and simple. Write to the stations and tell 
    them to stop this practice. Don't get me started on the practice of 
    showing commercials in theatres: I recently went to see <B><A HREF="forgotten_2004.htm">THE
     FORGOTTEN</A></B> (2004) at an AMC Theatre and had to sit through 15 
    minutes of commercials. Not trailers, mind you, but COMMERCIALS! Ads 
    for Coke, Hewlett-Packard, Chrysler and other companies blared on the 
    big screen. The only difference between here and home is that they 
    had a captive audience that couldn't press the channel button on the 
    remote control. I may just stop going to theatres and wait for the 
    DVD release but I'm sure that they'll invade that format (if they 
    haven't already done so) very soon. This shit has got to stop!</FONT></FONT></P>

     made its debut on the SCI-FI Channel on October 9, 2004. With a 
    title like that, you would think that it would be a comedy but that 
    couldn't be farther from the truth. It was one of the bloodiest 
    things that I ever saw on basic cable and that's saying a lot. It 
    starts out rather slowly, allowing characters to be introduced and 
    supplying a little background. Then about at the halfway mark people 
    begin to get slaughtered by the giant land-walking fish (actually 
    mutated Chinese Snakeheads). It's a sight to behold. Richard Edson 
    (playing a pot-smoking nudist) gets his head bitten off.&nbsp; 
    Another gets bitten in half while climbing a ladder. Still another 
    gets thrown into the spinning blades of an air boat. But the most 
    surprising bit of violence comes when China Chow, playing a main 
    character and sidekick to medical examiner Tory Kittles, gets half 
    her face blown off by an errant shotgun blast. It comes as quite a 
    shock and is alone worth watching this film. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe (<B><A HREF="spawn_1997.htm">SPAWN</A></B> 
    - 1997) fills the film with quirky character actors, including genre 
    film stalwarts Muse Watson, Mark Boone Junior, Tomas Arana and Raoul 
    Trujillo and some good location work. It does rely a little too much 
    on CGI, but not knowing if another major character is going to be 
    killed off more than makes up for it's shortcomings. There definitely 
    was some editing done on SCI-FI's behalf, so wait until it comes out 
    on DVD (about 2 weeks after it's TV premiere). This film is better 
    than most of the junk that makes their debut on&nbsp; SCI-FI, 
    including the similarly-themed <B><A HREF="snakehead_terror_2003.htm">SNAKEHEAD

     PRIVATE RYAN</A></B> uncut and unedited (with limited commercial 
    interruptions) on Veterans Day 2004. Since Speilberg would only let 
    this film be screened on TV that way (this is the third time it was 
    shown on TV this way), I guess it shows how much clout he has when it 
    comes to showing his films on TV. It's probably the best depiction of 
    war ever made for film (especially the first 25 minutes, a cinema 
    verite of sudden death, bloody water,<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/return to mayberry vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="160" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"> 
    spilled guts and body parts). What really chaps my ass is that the 
    ABC-TV affiliates down South in the Bible-Belt, George Bush-loving 
    States refused to show the film due to it's coarse language (none of 
    the &quot;fucks&quot; were bleeped out and all of the salty language 
    was intact). Citing fear of the FCC, these affiliates refused to show 
    the film, instead putting on <B>RETURN TO MAYBERRY</B> in it's place! 
    This is a slap in the face to all Veterans who served in Wars. 
    Soldiers were known to use rough language and Speilberg was not 
    afraid to play it straight. All the Veterans of War that I talked to 
    agreed that <B>RYAN</B> is one of the finest depictions of the 
    experience of being in the middle of a confrontation ever depicted on 
    celluloid. To these Southern State politicians and business big-wigs 
    I only have one thing to say: &quot;Welcome to the 21st Century. 
    There is no more racial discrimination (except in Texas, where they 
    love to drag Black men behind pickup trucks), people are dying every 
    day in a War we have no business being in (except to protect our oil 
    interests) and TV is not the root of all evil. People are the root of 
    all evil and it's your backwards-thinking that delays the progress of 
    mankind. Thanks to you, we will have four more years of religious 
    fervor and needless casualties. Get your heads out of your asses and 
    think straight for a change. When we say, 'God Bless America', we're 
    not saying 'Screw Everyone Else'. Please wise up before before it's 
    too late.&quot; I'm not knocking the good citizens of these States, 
    even if you did give Bush four more years to rule the roost. I don't 
    think I'm being paranoid.&nbsp; I just can't seem to get my mind 
    around how people can be so easily manipulated, even when there's 
    evidence out there to put most of the major politicians behind bars 
    or at least out of office. Why do you think that a lot of Bush's 
    cabinet members jumped ship after he was re-elected? I think 
    conscience had a lot to do with it. I've lost all confidence in our

    my take on the 2004 -2005 TV Season so far: <B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B> 
    is the best new show this year, period! There's nothing better than 
    watching this show about 47 people stranded on a mysterious island 
    after a plane crash and learning about their lives in the backstories 
    that truly twist and turn. The episode about John Locke's (Terry 
    O'Quinn) backstory (&quot;Walkabout&quot;) was a stunner and opened a 
    whole new can of worms about <A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lost season 1 tv ad.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="268" HEIGHT="174" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>what
     this island really is. The producer, J.J. Abrams, who also created <B><A HREF="alias_tv_series.htm">ALIAS</A></B> 
    (a show I was never able to get 'in' to) and directed the magnificent 
    2 hour pilot, has crafted a show about duality. Just when&nbsp; you 
    think you get to know a character something surprising turns up which 
    makes you take a 180 degree turn. This is what great television is 
    supposed to be. It could have been hokey, but it grips you and pulls 
    you in. I just wish that they would open the hatch already! Other 
    observations: Charles Durning should win an Emmy for Best Supporting 
    Guest Star on the series <B><A HREF="ncis_tv_series.htm">NCIS</A></B> 
    (formerly <B><A HREF="ncis_tv_series.htm">NAVY NCIS</A></B>). His 
    portrayal as a confused WWII Medal of Honor winner who turns himself 
    in for murdering his best friend during the War is a heartbreaking, 
    warm and funny performance of an old man slowly losing his mind 
    because everyone he once knew is now dead. Cudos also to Mark Harmon 
    as the caffeine-addicted head of this NCIS investigative group, a 
    no-nonsense boss but is loyal when it counts. A shout-out to Poppy 
    Montgomery for her excellent acting in the two-part <B><A HREF="without_a_trace_tv_series_2002-2009.htm">WITHOUT
     A TRACE</A></B> episode dealing with a missing girl. We got to know 
    a lot about her character in these episodes which makes us appreciate 
    her humanity and fallability. An Emmy to her also. And what about the 
    season-opener of <B><A HREF="third_watch_tv_series.htm">THIRD WATCH</A></B>?
     It was one of the most exciting and nerve-wracking episodes ever as 
    the seige of the hospital by Gene Simmon's hired goons resulted in so 
    many gunshots and one spine-tingling knife fight and an ending that 
    more than satisfies (who wouldn't want to see Simmons shot dead while 
    handcuffed and fall into a pool?). Since this is the series last 
    season, you can be sure that major characters will die. The TV season 
    is still young (I'm writing this in early December 2004), so I'm 
    looking for more great things in the near future. <B><A HREF="house_md_tv.htm">HOUSE
     M.D.</A></B> is also a promising show (already renewed for a second 
    season) and Hugh Laurie's performance as the caustic and 
    Vicodin-popping title character is amusing as well as surprising. 
    Also, enough with the <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI</A></B> spinoffs. I 
    know that they are big money makers for CBS, but the newest one, <B><A HREF="csi_ny_tv.htm">CSI

    starring in movies such as <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Zombi 3">ZOMBI

     denominator. Future episodes so far have steered clear of this plot 
    point, but the series is shot so dark that it is sometimes hard to 
    see what's going on. Even TV GUIDE backs me up on this. (NOTE: As of 
    writing this it has lightened-up quite a bit, even injecting some 
    humor into the proceedings.) Speaking of TV GUIDE: Have you noticed 
    how they have scaled waaaay back on their late night and morning TV 
    listings? It's impossible for us insomniacs to find out whats playing 
    after midnight using it. Their 'BIG MOVIE GUIDE' at the back of the

    the horror section? Flubs like this abound every week and I have come 
    to depend on my Sunday newspaper's TV pullout for more detailed info 
    on movies and shows. TV GUIDE has turned from an essential object to 
    an impulse buy if the cover strikes me. They seem more interested in 
    theatrical movies than TV anyway. Bad move! Just beginning to watch <B><A HREF="medium_tv_series.htm">MEDIUM</A></B> 
    and while some of the plots are kind of shop-worn, I do like the 
    interplay between Patricia Arquette and Jake Weber, who play the 
    psychic wife and rocket scientist (seriously!) husband. Based on the 
    life of a real person, there are some &quot;aha!&quot; moments to be 
    had here, as her visions are not always correct and can be 
    misinterpreted. The menu scene at the finale of the second episode is 
    one such moment, although some people just will not get it and 
    scratch their heads. I like shows like that. It is getting better as 
    it progresses though, as the episode where her soldier brother comes 
    back from Iraq and has the sight just like she has. The scene in the 
    hospital where Arquette wears headphones to drown out the dead people 
    asking her for help chilled me to the bone. It grabbed enough viewers 
    to already be renewed for a second season and have 3 additional 
    episodes filmed for this season. Just saw the first 2 episodes of <B><A HREF="numb3rs_tv_series_2005-2010.htm">NUMB3RS</A></B> 
    and it doesn't impress me, even though Ridley and Tony Scott are 
    involved in it. Trying to make mathematics sexy just doesn't cut it 
    for me. It tries hard (maybe too hard) to surprise the viewer. Good 
    actors involved in routine CSI-like scripts. <B><A HREF="law_&amp;_order_trial_by_jury_tv.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: TRIAL BY JURY</A></B> (the fourth series in the 
    franchise) is actually a good series that shows what the other three 
    don't. If you have ever served on a Grand Jury, you will know that it 
    actually happens as they show it on the series.&nbsp;Since the 
    regretful and sad death of co-star Jerry Orbach (who filmed two 
    episodes before he died), the series still shines, even if it is put 
    in the unwanted 10:00 PM Friday slot (against <B>NUMB3RS</B>). As of 
    May 2005, NBC has announced that it will not be back next season.

    still packs the most emotional punch and contains some of the best 
    action sequences of any Bond film. George Lazenby is more than 
    adequate as Bond (I would have liked to see him do more films) and 
    Diana Rigg's death is still the most shocking scene in any Bond 
    film.&nbsp; I'm not knocking Sean Connery (who in my opinion reached 
    his pinnacle in <B><A HREF="goldfinger_1964.htm">GOLDFINGER</A></B> - 
    1964). Without him there would be no James Bond. His early films as 
    Bond showcased him as a mean mother who wasn't too good to bitch-slap 
    or arm-twist a woman for giving him a wrong answer and was shown as a 
    cold-blooded killer. As the films progressed, the films got jokier 
    and gadget-laden (not always a bad thing) and Roger Moore's films 
    were the chief offenders. Don't get me wrong, they're all good films, 
    better than 90% of the films being made at the time. Again, I may be 
    in the minority but I find Moore's <B><A HREF="for_your_eyes_only_1981.htm">FOR
     YOUR EYES ONLY</A></B> (1981) to be his best Bond film. Although 
    Timothy Dalton did only two Bond films, <B><A HREF="licence_to_kill_1989.htm">LICENCE
     TO KILL</A></B> (1989) is a kick-ass action film which brings Bond 
    back to the angry man that he once was. It's the only Bond film where 
    he's not on assignment and everything is personal (Felix Leiter 
    [David Hedison] and his bride are fed to the sharks and Felix 
    survives barely). He was one mean son-of-a-bitch (the first Bond film 
    to get a PG-13 rating) and it ended the marathon perfectly. Another 
    tidbit that I really liked was Bruce Glover's portrayal as one of a 
    pair of gay killers in <B><A HREF="diamonds_are_forever_1971.htm">DIAMONDS
     ARE FOREVER</A></B> (1971). The look on his face as he was thrown 
    overboard on the ship in the finale was priceless. One can see where 
    his son Crispin Glover gets his unusual acting style. On the 
    downside, all the films shown were not in letterbox (except for the 
    credits), they showed the bastard stepchild <B><A HREF="never_say_never_again_1983.htm">NEVER
     SAY NEVER AGAIN</A></B> (1983) which doesn't have a place in this 
    canon (the original version had Connery passing Timothy Dalton in the 
    casino and winking at each other, but MGM cut the scene when they 
    bought the picture), and Encore has the habit of putting those 
    annoying bits of self-promotion at the end title sequences, squeezing 
    them to the point of being unreadable. (Now Encore and Starz put 
    their logo at the bottom right of every movie they show! This is 
    complete bullshit! It's distracting and an insult to the filmmakers.) 
    Unexcusable for a pay cable network. Still, all-in-all, I had a great 
    time watching these films uncut (<A HREF="abc_tv_bond_films.htm">ABC TV</A> 
    used to cut these films to shreds and digitally added bras and 
    panties to some of the &quot;Bond Girls&quot; as well as excising 
    some of the violence and completely shuffling some scenes around, 
    especially on <B>MAJESTY</B>) and bringing back memories of me as a 
    kid going to the drive-in with my parents to watch these films. Now, 
    I need to get some sleep! NOTE: Some later showings of these films on 
    ENCORE were in fact shown in the widescreen format. They just didn't 
    advertise it. With the advent of DVD and widescreen, why would anyone

    characters and how they function as a family unit. The final fifteen 
    minutes will leave you absolutely flabbergasted as we find out the 
    fate of all the series regulars in the future. Especially horrific 
    was the death of Keith, killed by a gunman's bullets while robbing 
    his armored car in 2025. Even though the series faltered the past two 
    seasons, after the death of Nate (Peter Krauss), the series went back 
    to its' prime. A perfect ending to a groundbreaking series.</FONT></FONT></P>

    nearly completed re-recording all my VHS tapes to DVD-R. Here's a 
    word of advice: If you put a label on them, they may play well in 
    your DVD player but make it nearly impossible to make copies from a 
    computer DVD recorder. The label somehow makes the DVD-R too thick to 
    read and errors occur when trying to duplicate them. Get yourself a 
    good DVD marker and write the name of the title on the DVD instead of 
    putting a label on it. You will thank me later on. I have three 
    different brands of DVD recorders on my computers, so this phenomenon 
    is not dependent on just one brand. I can't tell you how many hours 
    it took me to finally get my collection back to normal. Lots of lost

    production companys way of telling the stars that they are replacable 
    when their salary raises come due. Not a bad power tactic if you ask 
    me. Think about it: Is any star worth 5 to 20 million dollars a year? 
    Another reason is to increase the ratings during sweeps months. In 
    any case, some of the deaths were truly unexpected and others just

    it is Halloween Night, October 31, 2005 (my favorite night of the 
    year) and not one kid has come to my door! When I was a kid (many 
    years ago), Halloween was a time of celebration, a night to go out 
    with your friends and get as much candy as you could. Nowadays, 
    parents are scared to let their kids go out and get candy from 
    strangers, being that everyone that they don't know must be a pervert 
    or pedophile. When I was a kid, parents didn't worry about such 
    things. We used to walk for blocks and blocks, knocking on every door 
    and getting candy from nearly every house that we came to (some even 
    gave us money!). Parents need to lighten up a little bit today and 
    let their kids go out on Halloween, even if one of them must 
    chaperone a group. Kids today don't know what they're missing and I 
    blame the overworked, undereducated (in a worldly sense) parents who 
    would rather trust the daily newscast than let their kids go out and 
    have a good night. All the news reports focus on the few bad apples 
    in the bunch and not the decent, law-abiding people who love children 
    coming to their door to see their get-ups. Halloween today is 
    basically an adult holiday, as more mature people dress up in scary 
    and imaginative costumes than kids do. And they have some wild 
    parties! Do you know what I did with all the candy I bought this 
    year? I went to a neighbor's house and gave it all to their kids. You 
    should have saw the smile on their faces. Isn't that what Halloween 
    is all about? (At least in modern-time terms. In ancient times it was 
    totally different.)</FONT></FONT></P>

    Katie Holmes rants, is good here as a father who needs to learn a few 
    thing about kids and fatherhood. The effects are good and the 
    situations scary, but what the Hell was Spielberg thinking when he 
    put in the Tim Robbins character? He's totally out of place and out

    prove that he did not do it. Being an obscure film, I picked it up on <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</A> 
    for a measly two bucks. The only problem was that this must have been 
    a TV print as all the violence and language was cut out of the film. 
    It clocked in at a slight 72 minutes (probably to fit into a 90 
    minute slot). The Video Treasures box says that it is rated R but 
    don't you believe it. It would get no more than a TV-PG rating if 
    shown in this form. According to various sources, at least ten 
    minutes were cut from this version and the edits are very obvious. 
    Whenever someone is shot, you hear the gunshot and then a 
    poorly-edited cut to the next scene. Robert Blake sounds like a 
    choirboy because whenever he swears the sound goes blank. It also 
    stars Ernie Borgnine as a cop and Tomas Milian as a mysterious

    after casting their vote. When our Republican friends see how this

    rather broadly (especially an over-the-top performance by Dante 
    regular Robert Picardo), people have been slamming this episode by 
    saying politics has no place in horror. Bullshit! The 50's were rife

    horror, people, and I think Joe Dante deserves a lot of credit for 
    being brave enough to tell it like it is. I write this on Sunday, 
    December 18, 2005 and just saw our President give a speech on Iraq 
    and the war on Terrorism. In his whole 17 minute speech he did not 
    once mention Osama Bin Laden (the source of the &quot;War on

    politicallly-owned companies who profit from this mess, but did

    complete opposite? Has anyone even ever asked this question before? 
    On the whole, so far, the <B>MASTERS OF HORROR</B> series has been a 
    mixed affair. I really liked John Carpenter's &quot;<A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">Cigarette
     Burns</A>&quot;, liked Dario Argento's &quot;<A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">Jenifer</A>&quot;
     (I remember the same story in the EERIE comic book in the 70's) and 
    Stuart Gordon's &quot;<A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">Dreams In

     (although the off-the-cuff comment about werewolf attacks in 1981 
    London was funny) and Tobe Hooper's &quot;<A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">Dance

    really delivered. Time will tell if the other as-yet unaired episodes 
    will contain this quality. UPDATE: Just saw William Malone's (<B><A HREF="creature_1984.htm">CREATURE</A></B> 
    - 1985) episode entitled &quot;<A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">The
     Fair-Haired Child</A>&quot; and am glad to report, after a slow 
    beginning, that this episode delivered on the chills and surprises 
    that a horror anthology series should offer. The monster was scary, 
    the photography appropriately moody and it had a nice twist ending. 
    Lucky McKee's (<B><A HREF="may_2002.htm">MAY</A></B> - 2002) &quot;<A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">Sick
     Girl</A>&quot; was a great black comedy with a standout performance 
    by Angela Bettis playing a lesbian with a thing for bugs. There's 
    some great dialogue in this episode, especially by her male job 
    partner: &quot;Make sure you call me by 6:30 AM with all the details, 
    because that's when I take my shower.&quot; is what he says when he 
    finds out that she has picked up a strange pretty girl who likes to 
    draw pixies. My new favorite episode is Larry Cohen's &quot;<A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">Pick
     Me Up</A>&quot;, a very black comedy about two competing serial 
    killers after the same girl (Fairuza Balk). It contains a standout 
    quirky performance by Michael Moriarty (as only he can do it) as one 
    of the serial killers. As most of Cohen's films go, this one also 
    contains some priceless dialogue (and a tongue-in-cheek comment about 
    killer babies, a sly reference to Cohen's <B><A HREF="its_alive_1973.htm">IT'S
     ALIVE</A></B> - 1973 and his two sequels) and a truly twisted 
    ending. John McNaughton's (<B><A HREF="henry_portrait_of_a_serial_killer.htm">HENRY</A></B>)
     &quot;<A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">Haeckel's Tale</A>&quot;,

     15, 2006: This just in from IMDB: <B>&quot;Although CBS claimed in 
    an FCC filing this week that complaints about an episode of <A HREF="without_a_trace_tv.htm">Without
     a Trace</A> were invalid because they all came via websites operated 
    by the Parents Television Council and the American Family Association 
    from people who had never seen the show, the scene in question had in 
    fact been posted on the PTC website. In its filing, CBS asked the FCC 
    to rescind its record indecency fine of $3.3 million, maintaining 
    that &quot;there were no true complainants from actual viewers.&quot; 
    Viewed on the PTC website, the clip, which lasts about a minute, 
    would seem to bolster the network's case that, contrary to claims 
    that it depicts a teenage orgy, it shows no nudity, simulated sex, or 
    offensive language. Moreover, it aired after 10:00 p.m. In its filing 
    on Monday, CBS further observed that according to FCC rules, 
    complaints must come from someone actually watching an offending show 
    in the broadcast area of the station at issue. In a statement on 
    Tuesday, L. Brent Bozell, who heads the PTC and the AFA, charged that 
    CBS was engaging in &quot;stupid legal maneuvers&quot; and remarked, 
    &quot;Every complaint filed comes from a United States citizen who, 
    last I heard, had the constitutional privilege to petition his government.&quot;&quot;</B> 
    I wouldn't call this stupid legal maneuvers. The complaint has to 
    come from a viewer, not a representative of the oppressive PTC, AFA 
    and their ilk. This is entrapment, plain and simple. Anyone who saw 
    the episode knows that the PTC took the whole scene out of context, 
    just by showing the one minute scene and not the entire episode on 
    their website. It's like showing a bad guy getting shot without first 
    showing all the bad things he did before the shooting. The last 
    remark in the statement is total bullshit as the complainer was not 
    acting as an American citizen, but as a member of the PTC and AFA. 
    Since Congress and the Senate have given the FCC the right to 
    increase indecency fines tenfold, we, the viewers, are all the 
    losers. What ever happened to parental responsibility, the V-Chip and 
    the good old TV ratings system? I guess it's not good enough for 
    those groups who want to impose their &quot;values&quot; on everyone 
    else. My father once said to me: &quot;If you don't like what you see 
    change the channel.&quot; I guess we don't have that right anymore.</FONT></FONT></P>

    regulars.&nbsp; They don't even cut out the nudity. They just fog the

    be uncut, even with commercials. Now they put the final credits in a

    Starz/Encore channels do the same thing, which is a damn shame, since 
    we pay good money for the privilege to watch their movies and TV 
    Series. It's bad enough we have to see those watermarked bugs on 
    every movie we watch (and sometimes they juice-up the bug with crap 
    that fills-up the lower-third of the screen with their most popular 
    shows, sometimes lasting 30 seconds or more), but to deny the people 
    who worked on a film to get their due in the final credits is

    on the auction market. The hipsters then leave the scene, leaving VHS

    then there are these Blu-Ray snobs who refuse to buy a DVD because it 
    doesn't have the &quot;look of a film&quot;. Jesus Christ, get a 
    fucking life. I've actually read that some people refuse to buy DVDs 
    because they would rather wait for the Blu-Ray to come out, which in 
    98% of the cases, it never will. They would rather not watch the film 
    at all until their demands are met (These are the same jerk-offs who 
    threw away their VCRs when they bought their first DVD player.). It 
    is not just idiotic and stupid, it hurts the boutique DVD labels who 
    put out these films. Instead of blaming torrents for the decline of 
    physical product, maybe these people should look in the mirror at the 
    real culprit. And it doesn't end there. When they do get their 
    Blu-Rays, they usually complain about too much &quot;DNR&quot; being 
    used or the disc has a one-second glitch or missing piece of dialogue 
    that destroys their whole enjoyment of the film. I have no problem 
    with real complaints with Blu-Ray discs being discussed with major 
    defects, but what ever happened to just sitting down and enjoying a 
    film? These people are way too young to remember how we had to watch 
    some films on a snow-filled tube TV screen with an antennae on the 
    roof of our houses. Quit sucking on your momma's titties and man-up! 
    Just because the technology is superior, doesn't equate that it is 
    better for everyone. As a matter of fact, as of the middle of 2012, 
    less than 30% of people with TVs capable of High Definition have a 
    Blu-Ray player (compared to 95% who own a DVD player). Not everyone 
    needs or wants to see the pock marks on Jack Nicholson's face. As the 
    technology gets better, our choices in titles becomes more miniscule. 
    And don't get me started with people who watch movies and TV shows on 
    their phones and tablets. Call me old-fashioned, but that stuff 
    belongs on a TV, not on a device that can fit in the palm of your 
    hand (I purposely left out laptops and computers because some of 
    their screens are huge and the picture quality is fantastic). 
    Opthalmologists, opticians and optometrists must be wringing their

     series and all the regular actors on the show seem to have upped 
    their acting to try and match an old pro. Danson even managed to make 
    the departure of original series regular Marg Helgenberger a little 
    easier to take. The introduction of Elisabeth Shue as CSI June Finlay 
    (who has some bad past with D.B. Russell, which I'm sure will be 
    addressed in future episodes) to replace Marg Helgenberger was also a 
    good choice. I was beginning to lose interest when William Peterson 
    left the series and was replaced by Laurence Fishburne (who 
    underplayed his role as CSI Dr. Raymond Langston to the point it 
    looked like he was sleepwalking through his role), but Ted Danson has 
    brought the series back to its former glory. I also like how they 
    have given Wallace Langham a bigger role in the show (he and the rest 
    of the lesser-known CSI lab technicians were usually given one 
    episode a year to shine) and I hope that he and the other non-opening 
    credit CSI lab tech actors get more to do in the years to come (it's 
    nice to see that Jon Wellner [who plays CSI techie Henry Andrews] get 
    his name in the opening credits starting at Season 13). I'm a little 
    upset that CBS has canceled <B><A HREF="csi_miami_tv.htm">CSI: MIAMI</A></B> 
    in 2012 (it surprises me how many people thought David Caruso wasn't 
    acting at all and was actually like his character Horatio Caine in 
    real life, something which couldn't be farther from the truth) and 
    kept the vastly inferior <B><A HREF="csi_ny_tv.htm">CSI:NY</A></B> on 
    their schedule (nothing against great actor Gary Sinise, but the 
    Miami version had the most colorful photography and strangest camera 
    angles of any series on TV.<B> NOTE:</B> It, too, has been canceled 
    [in 2013], even though it was still pulling in decent ratings, 
    especially for a Friday night.), but the inclusion of Ted Danson on 
    the original show takes the sting out of it a little bit. I am 
    officially a <B>CSI:</B> junkie again. The opening episode of Season 
    13 was a tour-de-force for Ted Danson and was a crackling good hour 
    of television by everyone involved in the show. Thanks, Ted! So far, 
    the show has been getting great ratings and has been renewed for a 
    15th Season in 2014. Did anyone actually think that this gory crime 
    procedural would outlast its spinoffs and enter a 15th Season? <B>NOTE
     #2:</B> Detective Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) is leaving as a show 
    regular at the end of Season 14 on May 7, 2014. He was one of the 
    series regulars from the first episode, but the storyline between 
    himself and his troubled daughter will be resolved before he leaves. 
    He may show up in future episodes in guest appearances, but he is 
    leaving the show as a regular. Goodbye Detective Brass. It was nice 
    having you around. Word has it that actor Treat Williams will join 
    the cast as a recurring character, an ex-cop who strikes up a 
    friendship with Danson's character in Season 15. <B>NOTE #3:</B> In 
    what has to be some kind of new category, the makers of <B>CSI:</B> 
    will create a new series called <B>CSI: CYBER</B> starring Patricia 
    Arquette for the 2014 - 2015 television season (she appeared in 
    character in one of <B>CSI</B>'s late episodes in Season 14). This is 
    after both <B>CSI: MIAMI</B> and <B>CSI: NY</B> were canceled a few 
    years ago. I have never heard of something like this happening before 
    in the history of television. NOTE #4: It looks like Season 15 could 
    be <B>CSI:</B>'s last, because CBS moved it to Sundays at 10:00pm and 
    its aiting has been suspended at least two weeks in a row because of 
    football overruns. It also costs CBS about $5 million per episode, 
    which happens to all well-established shows because of longetivity 
    and the salaries paid to some of the original actors that have been 
    with the show from the beginning (not to mention Ted Danson's 
    salary), not to mention they knocked-down the orders of episodes this 
    year to 18 from the usual 22. It doesn't look good for a Season 16. 
    The 2014 - 2015 TV Season is also the last for <B><A HREF="mentalist_tv_series.htm">THE

    (you know who you are), accusing me of faking my own death on 
    FaceBook, let me point you to an article in <A HREF="facebook_hack_08032012.htm">The
     New York Daily News dated August 3, 2012</A>. It seems that the 
    Major League Baseball FaceBook pages were hacked and ridiculous and 
    inflammatory messages were left on the&nbsp; N.Y. Yankees, San Diego 
    Padres, Chicago Cubs and other Major League team pages. Of course, 
    since these are Major League sites (not to mention major advertisers 
    on the site), the inflammatory messages were removed immediately by 
    FaceBook techs. I only wish FaceBook would do the same thing for 
    no-name individuals like myself, which took nearly three weeks to fix 
    (I immediately resigned from the site once my Wall was fixed). 
    Instead, I have people like William Wilson (a person who I use to 
    call my friend) questioning whether my FaceBook Wall was hacked and 
    his accusatory tone about my whole life left me speechless, not to 
    mention letting all the trolls (about 50% of AVManiacs forum members, 
    not to mention defamatory shit from other forums) out there make 
    stupid assumptions about my life. If William Wilson was any type of 
    man (Which I highly doubt any more, since he called me a liar in one 
    of his film reviews! How professional.), he would have contacted me 
    personally instead of posting that ridiculous rant on the AVManiacs 
    forum. I can't tell you how many emails I received from people who 
    also have had their FaceBook sites hacked and they all think William 
    Wilson is a piece of excrement. I think he's just a piece of dog 
    shit. I still like his blog (which I won't point to in a link because 
    he doesn't deserve my time), but that doesn't mean that I have to 
    like the person. People who have dealt with me in a business sense 
    (like auctions), know I always put a personal touch in every package 
    I send. I don't farm out my duties (Even when I was very sick, the 
    only thing I couldn't do was mail the packages, so I had friends do 
    it instead.) and make sure that I personally write out their address 
    and make sure that the package arrives as soon as possible. If that's 
    a sin, then I'm guilty as hell. Otherwise, William Wilson can take a 
    long walk off a short pier. <B>UPDATE</B>: Facebook said on Friday 
    (February 15, 2013) that it was the subject of a &quot;sophisticated 
    attack&quot; from hackers last month, but no user data was 
    compromised. Employees at the social network visited an infected site 
    and its servers downloaded malicious software, or malware, from the 
    mobile developer site. &quot;As soon as we discovered the presence of 
    the malware, we remediated all infected machines, informed law 
    enforcement, and began a significant investigation that continues to 
    this day,&quot; the company said in a blog post Friday. &quot;Facebook
     was not alone in this attack. It is clear that others were attacked 
    and infiltrated recently as well.&quot; Well, imagine that! <B>UPDATE #2:</B> 
    On November 5, 2014, CBS News at 11:00pm in New York will run a story 
    about people who have had their lives destroyed by having their 
    Facebook accounts hacked. I was interviewed for the piece, but have 
    yet to know whether I made the final cut. Even if I didn't, William 
    Wilson can take this story and shove it up his unprofessional ass.</FONT></FONT></P>

     puny box office debut this weekend (August 15 - 17, 2014) or were 
    viewers ready to euthanize the film&#146;s aging action heroes? 
    That&#146;s the question Hollywood&#146;s asking after the thriller 
    fell short of initial projections by roughly $10 million, debuting to 
    a paltry $16.2 million. As the dwindling numbers trickled in over the 
    weekend, studio executives privately pointed the finger at a leaked 
    copy of the film that hit the internet three weeks before its debut 
    and was seen by 2.2 million people. &#147;This is really a clear 
    situation where this had an impact,&#148; said Phil Contrino, vice 
    president and chief analyst of BoxOffice.com. &#147;It&#146;s hard to 
    measure, but the </FONT></FONT><A HREF="expendables_3_2014.htm"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/expendables 3 poster12 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="251" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">ripple

    spread as a result, can be seen in the soft opening.&#148; The

    original </FONT></FONT><A HREF="expendables_2010.htm"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>EXPENDABLES</B></FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">

     installment</FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> 
    debuted to $28.6 in 2012. Still, some box office observers are 
    hesitant to ascribe blame wholly to the illegal downloads, citing 
    franchise-fatigue after three films in relatively short order. 
    &#147;It got hurt,&#148; said on rival distribution executive. 
    &#147;You&#146;d have to say there was an impact there. But as low as 
    the numbers are, there was a whole lot more going on. There was some 
    audience rejection. When you go to the well too many times, 
    you&#146;re going to run out of gas.&#148; It&#146;s also not clear 
    that the majority of people who downloaded the movie illegally would 
    have paid to see it in theaters even if it wasn&#146;t available 
    online, argues Rentrak media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. Then 
    there&#146;s the continued strength of </FONT></FONT><A HREF="guardians_of_the_galaxy_2014.htm"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>GUARDIANS

     which still managed to do more than $20 million of business in their 
    third and second weeks in theaters. &#147;It&#146;s such a crowded 
    marketplace,&#148; said Dergarabedian. &#147;Even taking piracy out 
    of the equation, it&#146;s so much competitive than we thought it 
    would be.&#148; </FONT></FONT><A HREF="expendables_3_2014b.htm"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>THE

    was widely seen as a litmus test for the impact that piracy can have 
    on a film&#146;s prospects. Hollywood has tried to hit back against 
    illegal downloading in the past, backing controversial legislation 
    such as The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and The Protect IP Act 
    (PIPA). When those bills collapsed in 2012, undone by a grassroots 
    backlash and concerns about their impact on First Amendment rights, 
    studios choose to speak more softly. For the most part, their efforts 
    have been limited to outreach to Silicon Valley companies. Given </FONT></FONT><A HREF="expendables_3_2014c.htm"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>THE
     EXPENDABLES 3</B></FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&#146;s
     poor results, those overtures may grow more intense. Measuring the 
    impact of piracy on box office is difficult and the data can be 
    contradictory. For instance, an unfinished copy of </FONT></FONT><A HREF="x_men_origins_wolverine_2009.htm"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>X-MEN
     ORIGINS: WOLVERINE</B></FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> 
    was widely distributed online a month before the film opened in 2009, 
    but the picture still managed to rack up $373 million globally. 
    That&#146;s a big number and one that suggests a lot of people were 
    still willing to shell out for the finished product. However, some 
    research suggests that piracy can take a big chunk out of ticket 
    sales. A 2011 study by Carnegie Mellon University researchers found 
    that when a film is pirated prior to release, it loses nearly 20 
    percent of its potential revenue. Lionsgate, which distributed <B>THE 
    EXPENDABLES 3</B> and producer Avi Lerner declined to comment, citing 
    an ongoing lawsuit against 10 anonymous individuals they allege 
    shared a digital copy of the sequel with piracy sites.They may be 
    quiet now, but don&#146;t expect the studios to remain mum for long. 
    Fresh shots were just fired in the piracy war. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">(While
     I am sure piracy of the film took a lot of money away from the 
    boxoffice take, the fact that the last two chapters in this series 
    were Rated R and this one was Rated PG-13 and had an advertising 
    campaign of everyone smiling turned a lot of people off, too. This 
    could certainly spell the death knell for the series, unless the home 
    video versions sells millions of discs. Don't be surprised if the

    decides to change the name of channels? First, The Sci-Fi Network 
    became &quot;SyFy&quot; and then the Sleuth Channel became 
    &quot;Cloo&quot;. Not only do these channels give good spellers a bad 
    name (What do they do, have network executives ask first graders what 
    they would like their network to be called?), they make people wonder 
    if it is worth their time watching stations that clearly don't know 
    what the public wants. I gave up on SyFy a long time ago (Too many 
    Asylum Films and CGI-ridden &quot;SyFy Original&quot; films, 
    especially about natural disasters that will never happen and 
    creatures, like <B><A HREF="mega_shark_vs_giant_octopus_2009.htm">MEGA

    channels that substitute the letter &quot;S&quot; for the letter

    shortening their name to &quot;NatGeo&quot;. Have we become a nation 
    of bad spellers and short attention span spazzes? Maybe I'm just

     including myself, is devastated by the shooting deaths in a movie 
    theater in Aurora, Colorado that killed 12 people and injured 58 
    more, but when the city of Aurora holds a public survey to determine 
    what to do with the Century 16 multiplex theater (including tearing 
    it down), I just sit here and think to myself, &quot;Jesus Christ, 
    it's not the building's fault all these people were killed or 
    injured. It's the fault of a crazy psychopath and lax gun laws who 
    are really at fault.&quot; So what are we going to do in the future: 
    Tear down buildings, including schools and military installations, 
    because some asshole with an automtic weapon decides that he's going 
    to take as many lives as he can? This politically correct bullshit 
    has to stop and we have to begin blaming society rather than 
    inanimate structures and facilities. Until we put gun legislation in 
    its proper place (And I'm tired of hearing &quot;Guns don't kill 
    people. People kill people.&quot; That psychopath wouldn't have been 
    able to kill and maim all those people in a theater with a knife or a 
    crossbow before audience members took him down.) and get politicians 
    off the NRA payroll, shit like this is always going to happen. There 
    is no valid reason a regular citizen needs a semi-automatic weapon 
    that can easily be converted to fully automatic and we need a better 
    way to screen people who buy guns. When a regular citizen can buy 
    over 2,000 rounds of ammunition on the internet and no red flags are 
    raised, there is definitely something wrong with the system. Let's 
    quit passing blame on movie theaters and violence in films and video 
    games and put the blame squarely where it belongs: On the shoulders 
    of the NRA and its lobbyists. Do you ever wonder why there are so 
    many gun deaths in the United States? Well, I do. And I'm angry that 
    politicians refuse to cross party lines to find a solution. Yes, we 
    can stop people from buying box cutters and knives with blades that 
    are considered too long and making bombs, but we cannot stop Joe Blow 
    (who has an undiagnosed mental problem) from walking into a gun store 
    and purchasing a semi-automatic weapon after a background check 
    (which is nothing but a joke) or walking out of the store with a 
    fully loaded shotgun or hunting rifle. Why is that? Gun rights 
    activists are quick to point out that the Second Amendment to the 
    U.S. Bill Of Rights gives them the the right to &quot;keep and bear 
    arms.&quot; I certainly doubt that our forefathers and a 221 year-old 
    document meant that they could buy and keep semi-automatic weapons in 
    their homes. Hell, back in 1791, when the U.S. Bill Of Rights was 
    adopted, there wasn't even such things as bullets. People carried 
    muskets, which shot lead balls and took over a minute to load. Now we 
    have automatic rifles and guns that can shoot over 100 rounds a 
    minute. Our forefathers also wrote &quot;We The People...&quot;, not 
    &quot;We The Individual&quot;, so let's start using our collective 
    brains instead of our guns and start getting these no-good 
    politicians out of office and replace them with people who actually 
    care about people more than money and lobbyists (I would love 
    lobbying Washington D.C. and politicians to be against the law.). I 
    always get sick to my stomach when I read and see things like what 
    happened in Aurora, Colorado, Columbine High School in Colorado, 
    Congresswoman Giffords' shooting in Arizona, the Sikh Temple in 
    Wisconsin, Fort Hood In Texas and The Virginia Tech massacre. We act 
    all high and mighty when these assaults against human life happen, 
    but both the TV News and newspapers move on to the next latest thing 
    and forget they ever happened, leaving these towns and its people to 
    deal with the psychological scars by themselves. How many more of 
    these atrocities must happen before we say enough is enough? Maybe if 
    we lost the Revolutionary War, we would have a death rate as low as 
    England, where it is against the law for citizens to own a firearm. 
    Tearing down buildings because it is too painful to look at is like 
    putting a band-aid on a bullet wound. It's utterly ridiculous. <B>UPDATE</B>:
     My friend Michael Prymula informs me that the Century 16 theater 
    will NOT be torn down. It's currently undergoing renovation, and the 
    theater where the massacre took place is being converted into one of 
    those giant &quot;extreme&quot; digital screens. I'm glad level heads 
    prevailed. <B>UPDATE #2</B>: Just when you think that there are 
    leaders with level heads, a shooting massacre committed by another 
    mentally defective young adult at a Newtown, Connecticut grade school 
    happens on <B>Friday, December 14, 2012</B>, leaving 27 people dead, 
    including twenty children as young as six years-old. The President 
    comes on TV and wishes the families of the dead and wounded his best 
    while wiping his (crocodile?) tear-stained eyes, but how much do you 
    want to bet that nothing concerning gun laws change? The news outlets 
    will cover the tragedy for about two weeks, squeezing every ounce of 
    emotional juice out of the story, but the NRA will still stick with 
    the same old story: &quot;Guns don't kill people. People kill 
    people.&quot; and nearly every politician will be too scared to say 
    anything negative about gun laws on TV. I'm not the biggest fan of

    both Democrat and Republican, will talk about changing our gun laws, 
    but he thinks it will all be just talk and nothing will change!). And 
    the truth is that nobody outside the police force and military should 
    be able to own one, not even hunters (You want to give deer and other 
    animals the chance they deserve? Use a bow and arrow!). And even 
    then, they should all be given mandatory psychological exams every 
    year. Have you ever heard of anyone killing 27 people with a knife or 
    a bow? People would be pouncing on the nutjob, hopefully killing him 
    in the process, just so the news outlets have nothing to report (if 
    you want to call it that; it's more like playing on the viewer's 
    sympathy) besides a crazy man was killed by good samaritans when he 
    tried to kill people with a knife or a bow. He may kill one or two, 
    but there's no way he would be able to kill 27 people. On a more

    16, 2012</B>. No decisions have been made when the episodes will be 
    shown (Turns out they will be shown the following week!). Here we go 
    again, associating gun violence in films, TV shows and video games 
    with gun violence in real life. More stupid political correctness for 
    the masses to chew on. I hope they choke on it. Remember after the 
    devestation of 9/11, radio stations weren't allowed to play certain 
    songs and all TV shows and movies shown on TV had to remove scenes of 
    the World Trade Center because it would cause people too much 
    &quot;emotional pain&quot;? Same thing here. Ever since 9/11, we have 
    been losing much of our freedoms all in the name of 
    &quot;security&quot; (Patriot Act anyone?). Keep the people scared 
    and they will give up almost anything, including all their privacy. I 
    didn't fall for it then and I'm not going to fall for it now. Just 
    because some mental idiot with a gun kills a bunch of people doesn't 
    mean I should give up my rights to privacy (I especially dislike all 
    those &quot;If you see something, say something&quot; TV commercials. 
    What happens when a young woman accidentally forgets her purse on the 
    subway or some guy forgets his briefcase? Will they be waterboarded 
    or interviewed and inconvenienced for hours at a police station for 
    just being human?), yet you can't walk outside without some camera 
    being pointed in your direction with facial recognition software 
    running in the background or your email being scanned for certain key 
    words associated with terrorism. It may sound paranoid, but it is 
    true. The Government just doesn't want you to know it, because if you 
    do and wake up to the hypocrisy of it all, they lose all power. So 
    what I am saying is this: Quit being scared and live your life the 
    way you want. Don't let anyone control you. <B>UPDATE #3</B>: I just 
    watched President Obama's moving eulogy (<B>Sunday, December 16, 2012 
    at 8:38 PM</B>) in Newtown, Connecticut in front of the grieving 
    parents and family who lost loved ones and he promised to do 
    everything in his power to stop such tragedies again. The thing that 
    troubled me, though, is not once did he mention the word 
    &quot;gun&quot; or &quot;automatic weapons&quot; and say he would 
    push for stricter laws against them. Is it possible that even he 
    knows that he is powerless against the NRA or was he trying to be 
    considerate of the tragic families' feelings? I know if it was my 
    child that was killed, I would want to hear directly from the 
    President's mouth that he was going to change our gun laws so people 
    can't just purchase a weapon and hundreds of rounds of ammunition and 
    go on a killing spree. He said this was the fourth such common 
    incident he has endured since he was President, but nothing has 
    changed regarding gun laws. That doesn't say much about his 
    effectiveness towards getting guns out of hands of psychos, does it? 
    He is the President after all. As far as I know, the job is not just 
    a figurehead position and he does wield power (including veto power) 
    to change many things. It's time he and Congress and the House of 
    Representatives put their differences aside and do something 
    meaningful for a change, instead of making up such terms as 
    &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; and such to keep us in a frightened state. 
    The newspapers and TV News on <B>Monday, December 17, 2012</B> tout 
    that during the President's eulogy in Newtown, he promised to change 
    gun laws. The fact is, he never said that. He didn't mention guns 
    once, so how could he promise to change gun laws? This is just 
    another example of the news outlets not reporting the facts 
    correctly. All I want are the facts, not conjecture that we know will 
    not change as long as there is an NRA (Whose Facebook and Twitter 
    pages mysteriously disappeared the day of the shootings, probably 
    because they didn't want to read everyone's rage about the shootings 
    and their involvement in it.). <B>Wednesday, December 19, 2012:</B> 
    The NRA finally releases a statement regarding the shooting, saying 
    that it is &quot;willing&quot; to make some changes in support of 
    decreasing automatic weapons in civilian hands. I'll take a 
    wait-and-see attitude in regards to that statement (I'm willing to 
    bet the NRA does nothing, because what is a gun lobby without guns?), 
    but the object lesson should be this: Why do civilians have automatic 
    weapons in the first place? What do they need them for? Besides some 
    crazy doomsayers and survivalists in their compounds in the mountains 
    waiting for the apocalypse (who should be psychologically examined 
    and disarmed as soon as possible and not just of their automatic 
    weapons), there is no reason for any civilian to have them, or 
    extended clips that hold way too many bullets. If you are hunting 
    with an automatic weapon or waiting for the Mayan calendar to come 
    true (so you can finally try out your automatic weapons on human 
    beings), I think it is time to go to your computer and look for 
    psychiatrists in your area because you definitely need one. 
    Meanwhile, President Obama promises the ban on automatic weapon sales 
    will be reinstated by the time he gives the State of the Union 
    address in 2013 (with an addendum about gun shows, where it is too 
    easy to pick up any gun or weapon in less than five minutes). Another 
    wait-and-see moment, but how do we get them out of the hands of 
    people who own them now? Am I the only one who believes it is 
    possible? Make it against the law to own an automatic or 
    semi-automatic weapon or extended clips, with a mandatory five-year 
    jail sentence if one is found on your possession or in your home. 
    Give the civilians a year to turn them in on their own and then let 
    the law go into effect. No exceptions, like the &quot;three 
    strikes&quot; law. Of course there will be some hiccups, but the 
    benefits outweigh the shooting sprees. No parent should have to 
    experience seeing their six or seven year-old child in a coffin 
    because politicians with big pockets have no conscience. I'd rather 
    we build more jails than cemeteries. I really, really hope it is 
    different this time. <B>Thursday, December 20, 2012:</B> New York 
    Sen. Jay Rockefeller this week introduced a bill calling for an 
    examination of the effect of violent videogames. &#147;Recent court 
    decisions demonstrate that some people still do not get it,&#148; 
    Rockefeller said in a statement. &#147;They believe that violent 
    videogames are no more dangerous to young minds than classic 
    literature or Saturday morning cartoons. Parents, pediatricians and 
    psychologists know better.&#148; (As Bugs Bunny would say, &quot;What 
    a maroon!&quot;). Hollywood has responded to the second-deadliest 
    school shooting in U.S. history by postponing premieres, canceling 
    parties and not airing certain TV episodes that depict violence. It 
    has not delayed any movie openings, as happened after a July mass 
    shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. &#147;Hollywood knows 
    that there are people it will never convince, but it has to 
    positively influence the fence-sitters and make them think it can 
    reduce damage,&#148; Jonathan Bernstein, president of a crisis 
    management company, told <A HREF="http://www.thewrap.com">TheWrap</A>.
     &#147;It&#146;s a communication battle for influence at a visceral 
    level. If Hollywood doesn&#146;t do something, it takes far more 
    damage.&#148; And so it begins all over again with idiotic 
    politicians (especially Senator John McCain) blaming the 
    entertainment media for all the real violence in the world. When are 
    they going to learn that without proper medical care and stricter gun 
    laws, disturbed people are always going to go on killing sprees? 
    Millions of people play <B>CALL OF DUTY</B> and they don't go out 
    killing people. But just because this fucked-up &quot;autistic&quot; 
    (seems to me to be the newest medical excuse for every bad thing a 
    young person does) young adult had <B>DUTY</B> on his game console at 
    home, it must be the cause of his violent outburst. Time to put away 
    the entertainment media excuse and focus on the real problems. <B>Friday,
     December 21, 2012:</B> The NRA holds a press conference and here are 
    their bright ideas: Put an armed police officer in every school. Not 
    only is that a dim bulb solution (it hasn't worked in the past at 
    schools in NYC), but putting a police officer carrying a Glock or .38 
    Special pistol against a troubled person carrying automatic weapons 
    only puts the police officer's life at stake, even if he is wearing a 
    bulletproof vest. Most of these automatic weapon bullets are made to 
    go through kevlar (or their head). Leave it to the NRA to ask for 
    more guns rather than less. Kids who go to school to learn don't want 
    to see a gun, period, even if it is being holstered by a police 
    officer. The NRA is under the impression that if a mentally disturbed 
    person were to know there was an armed police officer at the school 
    he has targeted, he will back off. I highly doubt it. That is why 
    they are called &quot;mentally disturbed&quot;. They don't think like 
    you and I do. The NRA also wants a national database of the mentally 
    ill, but what if the shooter never saw a psychiatrist? The NRA 
    automatically thinks &quot;mentally ill&quot; means &quot;mass 
    murderer&quot;. How fucking stupid is that? There are plenty of 
    mentally ill people that lead full, productive lives and to put their 
    names in a national database will only harm them, not help them. New 
    York State is on the verge of passing a law that states no clip can 
    carry more than 7 bullets (the toughest such law in the nation), 
    which will make it harder for mass murderers to kill more than 7 
    people with a clip. But what if that person is carrying ten or more 
    clips? Nobody, including our own President seems to want to outright 
    ban the sale of semi or regular automatic weapons to regular 
    citizens, or make them turn the ones they already own into the 
    authorities and I can't understand why. There is no reason why anyone 
    besides the police and military should carry or need one. The NRA 
    also blamed films, the Media and violent video games for the 
    massacres. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Time to pry 
    that rifle from Charlton Heston's &quot;cold dead hands&quot; and put 
    the NRA out of business. These spineless NRA bastards blame everyone 
    but themselves. <B>Saturday, December 22, 2012:</B> Thousands of gun 
    rights supporters are petitioning the Obama administration to 
    consider deporting CNN&#146;s Piers Morgan, arguing the gun control 
    proponent is using his position as a TV news host to wage war on the 
    Second Amendment. &#147;British Citizen and CNN television host Piers 
    Morgan is engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution 
    by targeting the Second Amendment,&#148; reads the petition. &#147;We 
    demand that Mr. Morgan be deported immediately for his effort to 
    undermine the Bill of Rights and for exploiting his position as a 
    national network television host to stage attacks against the rights 
    of American citizens.&#148; The petition has attracted more than 
    11,000 signatures since its creation Friday. It was posted on the 
    White House&#146;s We the People website, which allows users to 
    create a petition which will receive a review by policy makers as 
    well as an official White House response should it gain 30,000 
    signatures within 30 days. Writing on Twitter Saturday, Morgan seemed 
    amused by the petition, and responded to a number of people asking 
    him (not so politely) to get out of America. (Well, there's 11,000 
    idiots that I will stay away from!. Seems to me that these gun rights 
    supporters forgot about America having Freedom of Speech. Doesn't 
    matter if they are British, Icelandic or Muslim, they can say what 
    they please. Besides, Piers Morgan's show is an interview show, not a 
    news show, so he can say anything he pleases without gun supporters 
    demanding he get kicked out of the country. Besides, Mr. Morgan 
    simply knows better what it means to live in a country that outlaws 
    guns to normal citizens. Even most British police officers don't 
    carry one.). <B>Monday, December 24, 2012:</B> The official tally for 
    the petition to get rid of Piers Morgan from the United States has 
    reached 31,000 signatures (which is way less than one quarter of one 
    percent of our population), most of them from Texas (Where the 
    petition began. Surprise, surprise.) and States in the Bible Belt. 
    Seems like these gun rights proponents forgot about our First 
    Amendment rights and only focus on their Second Amendment rights. Do 
    they actually think that our President will deport Morgan? I believe 
    they do, because they are nothing but a bunch of gun-loving idiots 
    who believe that banning semi and fully automatic weapons will mean 
    that the Government will go after their pistols, rifles and shotguns 
    next. <B>Monday, December 2</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">4</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>,

    Piers Morgan has reached 91,000 signatures. Believe&nbsp; me, there

    January 7, 2013:</B> According to the <A HREF="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com">Hollywood
     Reporter</A>: &quot;Piers Morgan interviewed -- or at least tried to 
    -- the man who created a petition to deport him on his CNN talk show 
    Monday night. Alex Jones appeared on Piers Morgan Tonight to talk 
    about his petition, titled 'Deport British Citizen Piers Morgan for 
    Attacking 2nd Amendment,' which he posted on the White House's 
    website. As of Monday night, it has received more than 100,000 
    signatures. (Petitions need only 25,000 signatures to generate a 
    White House response.) The petition was started in the wake of 
    Morgan's criticism of gun advocates in the wake of the Newtown, 
    Conn., elementary school shooting. 'British Citizen and CNN 
    television host Piers Morgan is engaged in a hostile attack against 
    the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment,' the 
    petition reads. 'We demand that Mr. Morgan be deported immediately 
    for his effort to undermine the Bill of Rights and for exploiting his 
    position as a national network television host to stage attacks 
    against the rights of American citizens.' On Morgan's show, Jones 
    came out with guns blazing -- so to speak -- rattling off his 
    arguments against Morgan, saying he started the petition to bring 
    attention to his belief that foreigners living in the U.S. want to 
    take away guns from Americans while the government continues to beef 
    up its weapons. '1776 will commence again if you try to take our 
    firearms!' he declared at one point, saying that the second amendment 
    isn't for 'duck hunting' but to protect Americans from 'tyrannical 
    government.' When the host tried to ask a question, Jones continued 
    to speak over or interrupt him. At one point, he told Morgan, 'You're 
    a hatchet man of the new world order,' and even seemingly challenged 
    him to a boxing match. After several minutes, Morgan finally said: 
    'Let take a break. When we come back, try and answer my questions.' 
    Responded Jones: 'All you're gonna do is sit there and play little 
    factoid questions.' He continued talking -- spouting off a crime 
    statistic -- but was cut as the show went to a commercial. After the 
    break, Jones continued his tirade and avoided answering Morgan's 
    questions. (This is your Editor speaking: They say everything is big 
    in Texas. Everything, that is, except Alex Jones' brain.). <B>Wednesday,
     January 9, 2013:</B> On the eve of the entertainment industry's 
    White House meeting to discuss gun violence in films and video games, 
    Motion Picture Association of America president Chris Dodd told The 
    Hollywood Reporter that his industry will consider voluntary 
    guidelines but will &quot;vehemently&quot; oppose any government 
    restrictions on content. Dodd and other spokesmen from various 
    sectors of the entertainment industry will meet with Vice President 
    Joe Biden, who has been charged by President Barack Obama with 
    recommending legislation to curb gun violence, Thursday night and 
    Friday. (Editor speaking again: Here we go again, blaming movies and 
    video games for real-life violence. They do this because they are 
    easy targets, but I'm glad Chris Dodd is standing his ground, 
    something you don't usually hear me say about the MPAA. Seems to me 
    the politicians should me more worried about passing mental health 
    legislation, since it is easy to see that these mass murders were 
    suffering from mental health issues. In other words, anything can 
    trigger violence in bat-shit crazy people, but don't take it away 
    from the millions who view movies and video games as entertainment, 
    not documentaries on &quot;how to&quot; kill as many real people as 
    possible.). <B>Wednesday, January 9, 2013:</B> The White House may 
    have just disappointed the nearly 110,000 people who have signed a 
    petition urging President Obama to deport CNN&#146;s Piers Morgan. In 
    a response released Wednesday titled &quot;When Discussing the Second 
    Amendment, Keep the First in Mind Too,&quot; White House press 
    secretary Jay Carney addressed the petition, which charged Morgan 
    with using his position as a cable news host to wage war on the 
    Second Amendment, and calling for his removal from the country. 
    &#147;President Obama believes that the Second Amendment guarantees 
    an individual right to bear arms,&#148; Carney wrote. &#147;However, 
    the Constitution not only guarantees an individual right to bear 
    arms, but also enshrines the freedom of speech and the freedom of the 
    press -- fundamental principles that are essential to our 
    democracy.&#148; Morgan has become an increasingly outspoken 
    proponent of gun control legislation in the wake of the school 
    shooting in Newtown, Conn. last month. He clashed with gun rights 
    advocates hours after the killings and continued to engage people in 
    debate on Twitter, as well as poke fun at supporters of the petition 
    to have him deported. Carney said Obama recognized Newtown 
    &#147;sparked an intense, and at times emotional, national 
    conversation&#148; about gun control, and posted a video the 
    president recorded to respond to the numerous White House petitions 
    on the subject. In the video, Obama said he supported the Second 
    Amendment, but added background checks should be conducted to keep 
    guns out of the hands of &#147;dangerous people.&#148; The Morgan 
    petition was posted on the White House&#146;s We the People site Dec. 
    21 and quickly gained the required 25,000 signatures to receive an 
    official response. Petition organizer Alex Jones made a rambling 
    appearance on Piers Morgan Tonight on Monday, where he said his 
    petition was created to bring attention anti-gun foreigners living in 
    the U.S. who were trying to take away weapons even as the government 
    increases its own arsenal. &#147;1776 will commence again if you try 
    to take our firearms!&quot; Jones said during the interview. The next 
    day, Jones posted a YouTube video in which he said he feared for his 
    life because of his gun rights stances, and added he was worried the 
    New York Police Department or mafiosos hired by New York Mayor 
    Michael Bloomberg would kill him. (Editor speaking: Alex Jones is one 
    of those people who should have a mandatory mental health exam. It's 
    highly apparent that he should be nowhere near a firearm.). <B>Sunday,
     January 13, 2013:</B> A spokesperson for the NRA says that Congress 
    will not have enough votes to pass a bill to ban assault weapons (He 
    seemed very happy about it.). Since Vice President Joe Biden will 
    give his recommendations on curbing gun violence to the President on 
    Tuesday, sales of semi-automatic weapons have skyrocketed, with gun 
    nuts fearing that assault weapons will soon be banned for sale. Who's 
    is right here, the NRA or the gun nuts? Only time will tell. My only 
    hope is that Biden (who I am beginning to regard as a force of 
    nature) doesn't recommend that the government get involved with 
    violence in films, TV or video games. That is not the answer and 
    never will be. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Assault 
    weapons are not used for hunting, so why do our citizens need them? 
    We have a healthy armed militia to watch our backs, so citizens 
    should be happy with their handguns, rifles and shotguns. There is a 
    reason the Tea Party is broke (bringing assault weapons to rallies, 
    churches, etc.). No one believes their line of bullshit any more. 
    These recent massacres have proved that and no amount of backtracking 
    on their part will repair the damage they have done to this country. <B>Wednesday,
     January 16, 2013:</B> President Obama holds a televised conference 
    where he announced sweeping changes in gun laws (and, thankfully, no 
    mention of violence in movies or video games) and wants the assault 
    weapon ban reinstated (although it probably won't pass in Congress 
    because the NRA are deep inside the Republican's pockets), along with 
    comprehensive background checks for the purchase of any firearm and 
    better mental health checks. And what does the NRA do? They release a 
    TV commercial calling the President a &quot;hypocrite&quot; because 
    his two daughters have Secret Service protection and they carry guns. 
    Of course they do, you mental midgets. Every President's kids since 
    the 60's have had Secret Service protection, otherwise they would be 
    easy targets for kidnapping. One gun shop owner compared banning 
    assault weapons to blaming cars for causing deaths. Moron. Guns were 
    made to kill, cars were made to drive. Of course people die in cars, 
    just like they do in house fires, tornados, hurricanes and cancer. If 
    you can't tell the difference, you should no longer have a permit to 
    sell firearms. <B>Thursday, January 24, 2013:</B> Sen. Jay 
    Rockefeller is making another attempt to get a National Academy of 
    Sciences to study the effects of violent content -- including violent 
    video programming. The West Virginia Democrat, who has announced he 
    will retire and not seek re-election in 2014, on Thursday 
    reintroduced his &#147;Violent Content Research Act&#148; with 
    bipartisan co-sponsorship from Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; 
    Mike Johanns, R-Neb.; Dean Heller, R-Nev.; and Tom Coburn R-Ok. While 
    Rockefeller pointed to concerns about TV violence, Johanns also cited 
    the movies. &#147;Our kids are routinely exposed to movies, 
    television and video games that glorify violence and allow them to 
    simulate violent acts,&#148; Johanns said in a statement. &#147;This 
    legislation will allow us to study what, if any, impact this exposure 
    has on our youth, and if it encourages or desensitizes our children 
    to the real-life consequences of violence.&#148; Under the 
    legislation, the National Academy would be required to undertake a 
    comprehensive look at whether violent programming and violent video 
    games harm children, either directly by causing kids to act more 
    aggressively or more indirectly. One focus would be on whether the 
    violent material has a direct and long-lasting impact on a 
    child&#146;s well-being. The bill calls for the study to be done 
    within 15 months and the results reported back to Congress, the 
    Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and 
    the Department of Health and Human Services. Rockefeller originally 
    introduced the call for a study last year, but he has had a long 
    history of concern about violent programming. In a statement 
    Thursday, Rockefeller cited the recent incidents of gun violence as 
    the reason for the bill&#146;s reintroduction. &#147;I&#146;m 
    reintroducing my bill because Congress should do everything we can to 
    address gun violence,&#148; he said. &#147;We need comprehensive 
    policies to fully protect our communities. This study is an important 
    element of this approach.&#148; (Editor speaking: Christ, here we go 
    again. Millions of people watch violent films, TV shows and play 
    violent video games and are upstanding citizens who would never break 
    the law because of what they watched or played. If Rockefeller and 
    his cronies can't understand that, maybe they should all retire. Just 
    like a politician to punish the many for the sins of a few. I guess 
    it is easier to take on the National Academy of Sciences than the 
    powerful Health Insurance and NRA lobbies.) <B>March 21, 2013:</B> As 
    expected, Congress declined to pass the semi-automatic weapons ban 
    and the ban of the amount of ammo allowed in a clip is dead on 
    arrival, thanks to NRA pressure. It's time we got rid of these 
    extreme cowards (many who are too old to make up their own minds, 
    nevermind the entire country), who have seem to have forgotten the 
    massacre that happened a mere three months earlier, and would rather 
    line their pockets with NRA lobby money. As one anonymous member of 
    Congress told the media: &quot;This Bill was dead before it even hit 
    the floor.&quot; How many more children's graves do we have to dig 
    before we get the Democrats and Republicans to open their eyes and 
    see the light? This decision makes me sad to be an American right 
    now. <B>April 29, 2013:</B> It is now official. I am completely 
    disgusted in our system of government where we can tell people what 
    to eat (not too much salt or calories now because we need you to 
    contribute to a failing health care system), how much they can drink 
    (I can drink 16 ounces in a minute. So I can just buy another 16 
    ounce bottle. Thankfully, this nanny law was overturned by a smart 
    judge in New York) and how old you have to be to smoke (a bad habit 
    kids, so don't do it, but I'm trying to make a point here), yet 
    Congress, the Senate and other politicians can't pass one page of gun 
    law restriction, not even for background checks and the amount of 
    bullets allowed in a clip. Jesus Christ, are they all mad or are 
    their pockets that deep with NRA money? What we need are less 
    politicians and more people with consciences that put the lives of 
    people above our right to own automatic or semi-automatic weapons. We 
    can all wish, right? <B>November 4, 2014:</B> Republicans win the 
    majority of seats in both Houses of Congress, so don't look for gun 
    laws to change for the better. Look for them to change for the worst. 
    I guess the majority of Americans don't care about children being 
    needlessly gunned-down in school or normal citizens being massacred 
    in places where they should feel safe. Look for more States to pass 
    open-carry laws as the simple-minded scare those with common sense by 
    carrying shotguns and semi-automatic weapons into your favorite 
    department stores and restaurants. Will this madness never end? <B>All
     Of 2015:</B> More mass shootings happen at extremely alarming rates, 
    yet all we hear is outrage and no laws to try to prevent it from 
    happening. My hope is that our next President (And please, Lord, 
    don't let it be Donald Trump!) in 2016 makes this issue one of their 
    top priorities. Never in my life have I seen a Senate and House 
    automatically oppose all of President Obama's legislation (And to say 
    it's not because he is Black is just being ignorant. Most of these 
    old Republicans come from Southern families that owned slaves. Some 
    older Democrats, too), so the President has to bypass them and use 
    Executive Orders. And here's one thing about Donald Trump: Just 
    because he says out loud what many people think doesn't make him a 
    good candidate for President. It makes him a racist. He seems to 
    forget that our country was founded by immigrants after we abused and 
    killed millions of Native Americans. He will destroy this country. 
    And remember this: As a businessman, he is a pretty poor one. He has 
    filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy three times. Does that sound like a 
    good businessman? Or a good politician? They say we all get what we 
    deserve, but we don't deserve Trump or Jeb Bush making decisions for 
    us. It's time for a woman in the White House, but there is going to 
    be plenty of mud-slinging from Republicans and the Religious Right, 
    who believe women are a lower species than man and should be 
    subserviant. In these &quot;enlightened&quot; times, people that 
    still think this way and back their beliefs by quoting the Bible are 
    total assholes.</FONT></FONT></P>

    usually don't review recent theatrical releases on this site, but 
    since this is a section of the site where I just speak my mind, I 
    have to wonder this: Is there a bigger badass in films today than 
    Dwayne Johnson? I know he made his name wrestling under the moniker 
    &quot;The Rock&quot;, but he can just drop that name now and go by 
    his real name. I just saw him recently in two films, the R-Rated <B><A HREF="faster_2010.htm">FASTER</A></B> 
    (2010) and as part <A HREF="faster_2010b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/faster 2010 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>of
     the PG-13 <B><A HREF="fast_and_the_furious_2001.htm">THE FAST AND 
    THE FURIOUS</A></B> (2001) franchise <B><A HREF="fast_five_2011.htm">FAST
     FIVE</A></B> (2011) and I have never seen a modern action hero play 
    two separate roles with equal aplomb as Mr. Johnson does. In <B><A HREF="faster_2010b.htm">FASTER</A></B>,
     Johnson is a betrayed getaway driver who watches his brother get his 
    throat cut after pulling a bank heist. Johnson gets a bullet in his 
    head, but survives and spends the next ten years in jail. When he 
    gets out, he wastes no time in killing all those responsible for the 
    betrayal and his brother's death, usually at the end of a gun. He is 
    chased by drug-addled cop Billy Bob Thorton and eccentric (but 
    physically fit) hit man Oliver Jackson-Cohen (who had polio as a 
    child), but they don't catch up with him until he gets everyone on 
    his hit list. You can see the &quot;surprise&quot; ending coming a 
    mile away, but that makes no difference, because Dwayne Johnson takes 
    no prisoners in this film and lets his gun do his talking (he does 
    show some compassion at the end, but even the most mean-hearted 
    bastard would have done the same). He makes the perfect anti-hero in 
    this film which, unfortunately, did very little business in theaters. 
    I can't imagine why. It's a great action film directed by George 
    Tillman Jr. (who directed the Notorious B.I.G. biopic <B><A HREF="notorious_2009.htm">NOTORIOUS</A></B> 
    the previous year) with a lean and mean screenplay by brothers Tony 
    Gayton (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Salton Sea">THE SALTON SEA</A></B> 
    - 2002) and Joe Gayton (<B><A HREF="bulletproof_1996.htm">BULLETPROOF</A></B> 
    - 1996). On the opposite end of the popularity spectrum, Johnson 
    plays a cop in <B><A HREF="fast_five_2011b.htm">FAST FIVE</A></B>, 
    who is out to capture Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and their gang (all 
    together for the first time since the original film). At first, he 
    wants nothing more than to see these crooks put behind bars and his 
    fight with Vin Diesel is a doozy (it's even better in the Unrated 
    Director's Cut DVD), but when he sees his entire special forces team 
    wiped out by a ruthless Rio drug lord (played by Joaquim de Almeida [<B><A HREF="desperado_1995.htm">DESPERADO</A></B> 
    - 1995]), he joins up with Diesel and Walker to bring these nasties 
    down. Besides the knock-down, drag-out fight between Johnson and 
    Diesel (there is no clear winner and I bet it was in both of their 
    contracts), there's also a thrilling safe heist by two cars that must 
    be seen to be believed. This film did <A HREF="fast_five_2011c.htm">blockbuster
     business in theaters</A> (It's easy to see why with the cast of 
    seasoned pros and pretty good direction by Justin Lin [Who directed 
    four <B><A HREF="fast_and_furious_3_2006_and_4_2009.htm">FAST AND THE FURIOUS</A></B> 
    films, including <B><A HREF="fast_and_furious_6_2013.htm">FAST &amp; 
    FURIOUS 6</A></B> - 2013, which also did blockbuster business in 
    theaters across the world. Part 7 will be directed by James Wan and 
    open on July 11, 2014] and a twisty screenplay by Chris Morgan [<B><A HREF="wanted_2008.htm">WANTED</A></B> 
    - 2008]), but I still prefer Johnson in <B><A HREF="faster_2010c.htm">FASTER</A></B>.

    his share of stinkers (<B><A HREF="tooth_fairy_2010.htm">TOOTH FAIRY</A></B>

    - 2007 (which always makes me laugh out loud) and <B><A HREF="other_guys_2010.htm">THE
     OTHER GUYS</A></B> (2010) have been entertaining junk food for the 
    mind. I didn't even mind Johnson in <B><A HREF="journey_2_the_mysterious_island_2012.htm">JOURNEY
     2: THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND</A></B> (2012). It's worth it just to hear 
    him sing his own lyrics to &quot;It's A Wonderful World&quot;, where 
    he compares co-star Michael Caine to Yoda! (He does sing the proper 
    version of the song as the end credits roll and he's not half-bad). 
    This sequel is much more enjoyable and fast-moving (if highly 
    improbable) than the <A HREF="journey_to_the_center_of_the_earth_2008_big_budget.htm">2008
     original</A> (which starred Brendan Fraser and not Dwayne Johnson) 
    and it was nice to see Luis Guzm&aacute;n (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Salton Sea">THE
     SALTON SEA</A></B> - 2002) get such a big role as the comical 
    character. <B>UPDATE:</B> Both Dwayne Johnson and Dolph Lundgren are 
    hosting their own Summer 2013 reality competition series. Johnson is 
    hosting <B><A HREF="hero_tv_series_2013.htm">THE HERO</A></B> on TNT, 
    where he puts ordinary citizens through &quot;dangerous&quot; 
    obstacles, while Lundgren is hosting <B><A HREF="race_to_the_scene_tv_series_2013.htm">RACE
     TO THE SCENE</A></B> on Reelz, where ordinary citizens re-enact 
    scenes from popular action films throughout the past three decades. 
    After watching teaser trailers for both series, I have to give 
    Lundgren's show the upper hand, especially when the competition have 
    to dress like Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in <B><A HREF="pulp_fiction_1995.htm">PULP
     FICTION</A></B> (1995) and recreate the scene where Travolta's gun 
    accidentally discharges and spreads the brains of their captive all 
    over the inside of the car. I was laughing hysterically. Johnson's 
    series looks more like an extreme version of <B><A HREF="fear_factor_tv_series_2001-2012.htm">FEAR

    them only in the <A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm">DTV Films</A>

    the creators of the <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW</A></B> 
    franchise haven't sued the pants off of director/writer Andy Hurst 
    (who did the first film) and directors/writers John Lands &amp; 
    Russell Appling (who were responsible for the sequel). First off, the 
    first film contains a voice that sounds just like the 
    &quot;Jigsaw&quot; character (played by Tobin Bell), but with an 
    ending so lame, you'll want to kick in the TV screen. The unrelated 
    sequel is twice as bad, since we know that Tony Todd is responsible 
    for all the &quot;ingenious&quot; traps. Do people actually find 
    these films entertaining? If they do, they are one of the main 
    reasons why there are no original horror movies anymore (or very 
    little of it). I know that filmmakers love to jump on the bandwagons 
    of films that have made some good scratch on theatrical screens 
    (witness <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</A></B> 
    [1999] &quot;found footage&quot; phenomenon, which turned everyone 
    with a video camera into a &quot;filmmaker&quot;, an annoying 
    practice which is still going on today [it's funny because the <B><A HREF="paranormal_activity_franchise.htm">PARANORMAL
     ACTIVITY</A></B> franchise killed-off the <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW</A></B> 
    franchise]), but there should be an automatic moratorium on how long 
    these copycat films can be made. Shitballs, they are still being made 
    today, a good eight years after the original films were made. If you 
    want reviews of films of this type, go to other review sites. I'm

    ex-boyfriend of one of the trannies) in the parking lot of the joint 
    the women work in. They are taught the finer points of martial arts 
    and knife-handling by their manager Fergus (Richard D. Curtin; and 
    this is one of the points that a reel is missing, probably because it 
    would cost too much to film it). Director/writer Israel Luna (<B><A HREF="fright_flick_2011.htm">FRIGHT
     FLICK</A></B> - 2011; <B><A HREF="ouija_experiment_2011.htm">THE

    material seriously, because the acting talent involved is, shall we 
    say, less than impressive (especially Tom Zembrod as lead baddie 
    &quot;Boner&quot;). In the film's defense, this is the first acting 
    appearance for 95% of the cast. At least there is truth to the title, 
    as the three trannies use their knife skills in the finale of the 
    film (even sticking a couple up Boner's gang's assholes!) and giving 
    Boner his just desserts in the bloody finale. The film is nothing 
    special, but the title makes me laugh. Filmed in Dallas, Texas. NOTE: 
    This film was given bad press by GLAAD (Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance 
    Against Defamation), which gets a quote against it on the DVD package 
    by John Waters, who says, &quot;GLAAD came out against it? Lighten 
    up. What the fuck?&quot; My sentiments exactly. It does not portray 
    the trannie community in a negative light (quite the contrary, it 
    shows them as a tight-knit community who actually care about each 
    other, even with some bitchy comments between the girls), which 
    proves to me only one thing: Even organizations which address the Gay 
    &amp; Lesbian community in a positive light can sometimes have huge 
    sticks up their asses. Whether they enjoy it or not is totally their 
    preference. The gay community has made wide strides in the past ten 
    years. Why can't they have their own horror fims without some gay 
    organization flinging shit at it? I'm not gay, but I do enjoy films 
    that portray the different lifestyles I have no idea about. We should 
    all learn to be tolerant of people that are different than us (and I 
    don't mean that in any detrimental way) and a good way to do that is 
    read books or watch films (even horror films) that portray those 
    lifestyles. <B>NOTE</B>: I have been getting some pretty serious 
    feedback from this post. It seems that those from the Nothern part of 
    the United States agree with me and most (but not all) of those from 
    the Southern part of the U.S. disagree with me (One guy even 
    threatened to cut my dick off!). To those in the Bible Belt, this is 
    all I have to say: Bite me! Since this movie was filmed in Texas, you 
    would think that most people wouldn't give a damn if someone was a 
    trannie or not, but the sad fact is, every email I received from 
    Texas was negative in tone. Thank God they're not allowed to carry 
    guns in that State (that was sarcasm).</FONT></FONT></P>

    lot of people want to know my opinion about torrent sites and its 
    relationship to low DVD sales. I's sorry, I just don't buy it as a 
    valid excuse. Yes, there are people out there who download the newest 
    blockbusters so they don't have to pay for a DVD or Blu-Ray of the 
    title, but I believe there are many more just like myself who use 
    these sites to download films that have never had a U.S. home video 
    release or fansubbed editions of foreign films that never had a 
    proper release in the States. I only belong to one torrent site, 
    Cinemageddon (I will not give out its URL, but it's easily found if 
    you Google it), and I have only used it to download films from the 
    Philippines and Indonesia that never had a home video release here. 
    If the film did have a U.S. VHS release, I will not download the film 
    from the torrent site, period. I will scour the Internet for auction 
    sites that may have the title for sale and always pay for the 
    privilege to see the film (or, in some cases, I just won't see the 
    film). Here's the rub: The person who wants to download a film must 
    do their research before using a torrent site. If the film has had a 
    legitimate home video release in any format, it should be off-limits 
    for downloading. So do your research before downloading a film for 
    free. It's really not that hard and only takes a few minutes if you 
    use <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cinemageddon logo small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="66" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0">search
     sites like Google or film sites like the IMDB. Yes, I know we live 
    in an economy where money is low and watching films takes a back seat 
    to such important things as eating and paying your rent, but that is 
    no excuse for downloading a readily-available film from a torrent 
    site for free. And I'm sick and tired of DVD companies complaining 
    that the use of torrents sites hurts their bottom line so bad, they 
    may go out of business. I firmly believe part of the problem lies 
    with the rights holders of the films and the exorbitant amounts of 
    money they ask for their prints. Blaming torrent sites for their bad 
    business in an economy like this is just plain stupid. Maybe the MPAA 
    and all the major film companies should try and figure out a way to 
    stop China and other Asian countries from pirating their films. 
    That's a major problem, yet you hardly read anything about it. People 
    like myself (and I believe I'm in the majority here) want to feel the 
    legitimate physical media in their hands, not a digital file on a 
    hard drive. Blaming torrent sites (especially with all these FBI and 
    Interpol raids) is just an idiotic excuse to put the blame on a 
    growing problem on the Internet. The Internet is not to blame; it's 
    the backwards approach that the MPAA and film companies take to fight 
    the problem. At least a lot of the film companies are now streaming 
    their titles, but believe me, when some hacker figures out a way to 
    grab these titles off the Internet for free, the majority of the 
    Internet community will suffer. It's like what the Music Industry 
    said when the MP3 was born. They screamed, &quot;This is the end of 
    the music industry as we know it!&quot; But when they adapted to the 
    digital format on the Internet and saw that there was big money to be 
    made, the Music Industry changed its mind really quickly and are 
    making money hand-over-fist. Here's hoping that we quit blaming 
    torrent sites and come up with a way to solve the film downloading 
    problem. It's small potatoes, yet they treat it like it's the end of 
    the world. And don't get me started on the pressed DVD/DVD-R debate. 
    A digital file is a digital file, so as long as the releasing company 
    puts their best effort into presenting the film on disc, I couldn't 
    care if it is a pressed DVD or a DVD-R. If you didn't look at the 
    physical media before putting it in your DVD player, there is no way 
    you can tell the difference (except DVD-Rs take a little longer to 
    load). And I'm also sick and tired of people saying that DVD-Rs have 
    a short life span. If you use the correct brand of DVD-R media (like 
    Verbatim), your discs should last a lifetime. I have had some for 
    over ten years that play just as well as the day I made them. I've 
    had more pressed DVDs fail on me than DVD-Rs. Agree with me or not, 
    but those are the facts. If you are so worried that a DVD-R you 
    bought is going to fail on you, make a backup. It only takes a couple 
    of minutes and it will give you peace of mind. Also be mindful that 
    weather can play a substantial part in how long your discs last. If 
    you live in a dry climate without hardly any humidity, you really 
    should have no problem with your discs. If you live in a 
    high-humidity climate (like the tropics), your best bet is to store 
    your discs in a dry, cool dark place like a closet.</FONT></FONT></P>

    (Sarah Butler makes a much stronger vengeful victim) and better

    first week of its theatrical release in January of 2013 (It was 
    delayed from its original October 2012 theatrical release date due to 
    the MPAA slapping an NC-17 Rating on it). It was savaged by critics, 
    but since when did that stop anyone from seeing a film? I watched the 
    Unrated version on VOD (so far, the only way to see the Unrated 
    version in the U.S., since the DVD and Blu-Ray are of the theatrical 
    R-Rated version) and it's pretty good, but not necessary at all 
    (There are some gaping plot holes, especially regarding the 
    timeline). It uses footage from the original Hooper film (which ends 
    with new footage of the entire Sawyer clan being gunned down by the 
    town's citizens, except for a female baby, who is kidnapped by a 
    white trash married couple and raised in another state under the name 
    Heather, unaware of her roots) and then switches to the present day, 
    where Heather (Alexandra Daddario), inherits her unknown dead 
    grandmother's mansion, not knowing that Leatherface lives in a locked 
    apartment in the basement. Even though Leatherface (played by Dan 
    Yeager) kills a lot of people (one is chainsawed in half while 
    hanging on a meathook), the film makes him seem like he has a much 
    more emotional core than the other films and even the police 
    department head, Sheriff Hooper (Thom Barry), lets him and Heather 
    get away with murdering those responsible for killing the Sawyer clan 
    decades ago, including the town's mayor, Burt (Paul Rae), who 
    organized the townspeople for the past Sawyer massacre (He has his 
    hands chainsawed off and he falls into an industrial meat grinder). 
    Look for cameos by Gunnar Hansen, Bill Moseley and the late Marilyn 
    Burns in the new footage and a funny stinger after the end credits 
    roll. It sets up for a sequel (rumored to be filmed and released in 
    2015) that could make Leatherface an anti-hero!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    [2008 &amp; 2009]), is not as bad as some people say it is (It was 
    supposed to be released theatrically, but went straight to 
    Blu-Ray/DVD, which to some means that it was too awful for the big 
    screen). It's not as good as the remake, but it has plenty of 
    positive points, including lots of gore, naked breasts (and some 
    full-frontal nudity), another 3-D penis gag (you have to see it to 
    believe it) funny performances by David Koechner and David Hasselhoff 
    (playing a parody version of himself), cameos by Gary Busey, Clu 
    Gulager (John's father), an uncredited appearance by a legless Ving 
    Rhames, reprising his role from the first film, who has a little

    plenty of actors who have played Holmes in the past 70 years, but 
    even I was quite pleased with director Guy Ritchie's updating of the 
    Sherlock Holmes mythology (it's probably the best film Ritchie has 
    ever done). Robert Downey Jr. plays Holmes as a two-fisted fighter 
    who sees his opponent's moves a few steps before his opponent does 
    and uses the experience for the money and the rush (he still likes 
    his liquid cocaine, too). Jude Law as Watson is pitch-perfect as his 
    companion who is about to get married (Holmes uses his bag of tricks 
    to try to dissolve the wedding, but he's got a great opponent in 
    Watson's intended, Mary, played by Kelly Reilly) and the chemistry 
    between Holmes and Watson couldn't be better. Since this is a Guy 
    Ritchie film, there are some great action set-pieces as well as some 
    really surprising emotional moments. This is one franchise I won't 
    mind continuing on for years to come. A sequel, <B><A HREF="sherlock_holmes_a_game_of_shadows_2011.htm">SHERLOCK

    have been better, at least for not reminding some audience members 
    that they are watching the most recent James Bond on-screen), but it

     ON FIRE</A></B> (2004) - I really, really wanted to dislike this 
    overlong 142 minute remake (directed by the late Tony Scott) of the 
    92 minute <A HREF="man_on_fire_1987.htm">1987 original</A>, 
    especially with the subtitles moving all over the screen and other 
    editing tricks (including draining the color out of the film so that 
    it looks like it was filmed through a gold lens), but damn if Denzel 
    Washington (replacing Scott Glenn in the original) didn't win me over 
    as an alcoholic bodyguard that will do anything to get back the 
    little girl (Dakota Fanning, in a great performance) who was 
    kidnapped by Mexican bad guys, even offering his life in exchange for 
    hers. He'll shoot, blow-up and generally do everything violent in his 
    playbook to get her back and we get to go along for the violent ride. 
    Like I said, at 142 minutes it's more than a little overlong (a Tony 
    Scott trait), but there's a lot of emotional scenes to go along with 
    the gunshots and explosions and we get the feeling that Washington 
    really cares for the little girl and she feels the same way about 
    him.&nbsp; Both the original and remake offer the same storyline and 
    I like the original a lot, but the remake has a core of emotion 
    usually not found in a Scott film (try keeping your eyes dry at the 
    finale). I know a lot of people will disagree with me, but that is 
    why we are all different.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Pacino (in a role originated by Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd) plays a

    blackmailed by a psychopath (excellently played by Robin Williams) 
    who knows his secret and is also under suspicion by his new partner, 
    played by Hilary Swank (also excellent). This is a really tense film 
    and a perfect companion to the original. This is Pacino's best role 
    in years (you can actually see the tiredness in his eyes, not just 
    about the insomnia, but the fact that his covering-up the accidental 
    cop homicide is eating away at his conscience) and the late Robin

     TWILIGHT ZONE</A></B> [1985 - 1989]) a fascinating and complex theme 
    on greed and the human condition. If it's subtext and symbolism that 
    you like, you can do no better than this film (I like it better than 
    Kelly's richly symbolic <B><A HREF="donnie_darko_2001.htm">DONNIE DARKO</A></B> 
    - 2001). A badly facially-scarred Frank Langella (an excellent 
    make-up job), the unlucky subject of a lightning strike (which

    of married couple Cameron Diaz (who has a malformed foot) and NASA

    table. He tells the couple that if they press the button, they will 
    receive one million dollars tax-free, but someone they don't know 
    will die if they press the button. The lure of one million dollars is 
    too much to endure, so they press the button. What happens next is 
    best left for the viewers to discover, but it is not an easy film to 
    comprehend, because it is full of deep symbolism and hidden subtext. 
    That's OK with me, because Kelly is a director who has no equal today 
    (he even out-Lynches David Lynch) and I admire that he makes films 
    that actually make you think (I even enjoyed his highly-panned <B><A HREF="southland_tales_2006.htm">SOUTHLAND

    not Willis O'Brien; Rick Baker did the ape makeup in the remake, 
    which was a combination of forced-perspective shots, model work and

     KONG</A></B> (1933), but this film and the remake are much more

    at heart when he saves a bunch of orphans in a burning building in 
    the original (the only sequence filmed in sepiatone color) and saves 
    a bunch of people from a burning ferris wheel in L.A. in the remake.

    Forsyth (who for some reason or another demanded his name be taken 
    off the remake). The original had Edward Fox as The Jackal, a hired 
    assassin whose next job was to kill the then-President of France, 
    Charles De Gaulle. In the remake, Bruce Willis is The Jackal, one of 
    the best assassins in the world and a master of disguise. He's so 
    good, in fact, that no one has ever seen his face except for Richard 
    Gere, who is in prison for being an Irish terrorist (if there is one 
    fault to this remake, it's Gere's Irish accent, which comes and

    promise of a pardon (which Gere knows is a false promise) if he 
    identifies and stops The Jackal, who is now in the United States to 
    assassinate the First Lady (Tess Harper) and the FBI Director. It's a 
    wildly entertaining film, with Willis donning many disguises (he even 
    plays a gay man) and the chemistry between Gere and Poitier cannot be 
    denied. Besides, if you ever wanted to see Jack Black get one of his 
    arms blown off and then cut down in pieces with a special weapon that 
    he has built for The Jackal, then this is the film for you. It's a 
    little long at over two hours, but you'll never be bored. The scene

    starters, the Jekyll/Hyde character is almost a secondary character, 
    just like in the original novel. It was more like a Sherlock Holmes 
    mystery, with Dr. Jekyll's best friend Utterson investigating a 
    series of murders in 1900 London (the film takes place about twenty 
    years later than the novel) and leads him to the mysterious Edward 
    Hyde. The film is based on Mark Redfield's (who wrote/directed and 
    plays Jekyll/Hyde, with some very cool transformation scenes) 1990 
    theatrical play and it does show its theatrical roots every now and 
    then (along with its meager budget), but it is also very entertaining 
    and very well acted by a cast of stage pros. The even better news is 
    that the DVD can be picked-up for $5.99 (or less) from <A HREF="http://www.oldies.com">Oldies.Com</A>.
     It's not overly bloody, but here's a chance to see a film that about 
    as close to the original novel as you are probably going to get. Pick 
    it up!</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

    co-production titled <B><A HREF="it_happened_in_broad_daylight_1958.htm">IT
     HAPPENED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT</A></B> (both films based on the book 
    &quot;Es Geschah Am Hellichten Tag&quot; by Friedrich

    Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson, in one of his best performances of the 
    new Millennium) makes a promise (the &quot;pledge&quot; of the title) 
    to the mother of a murdered girl that he will find the killer. Even 
    after he retires, he continues his hunt for the killer (all the other

    slowly-paced, so don't go into it looking for your usual slam-bang

     EXPERIMENT</A></B> (2010) - This remake of the German film <B><A HREF="experiment_2001.htm">DAS
     EXPERIMENT</A></B> (2001) is a great exploration of the human 
    condition (so is the original film, so don't ask me which one I like 
    better). Based on a real-life scientific psychological test called 
    &quot;The Stanford Experiment&quot;, it is the story of 24 
    &quot;everyday&quot; people who volunteer to participate in a two 
    week experiment where everyone is put in a prison and 8 of the people 
    are assigned as &quot;guards&quot; and the other 16 are assigned as 
    the &quot;prisoners&quot;. It is not long before the 
    &quot;guards&quot; start abusing the &quot;prisoners&quot; and the 
    &quot;prisoners&quot; begin becoming just as violent, not just 
    against the guards, but also amongst themselves. The results are 
    frightening and the real-life scientific experiment was stopped early 
    and was never performed again because it was considered too inhumane 
    to everyone involved. People with normal, everyday jobs were turned 
    into violent, nearly soulless tormentors because they were either put 
    in a position of authority or stuck in a cell and treated like 
    animals. It just shows that every one of us is capable of violence if 
    put in a position such as these people were. The real-life Stanford 
    Experiment involved college-aged volunteers, but both films use 
    adults as the guards and prisoners. Both of these films are excellent 
    examples why prison is not the answer for most minor crimes 
    (especially drug abusers). All it does is make the 
    &quot;criminal&quot; a worse person than he/she already is. Watch 
    both films to see what I mean. They take certain liberties with the 
    results of the real experiment (although some of the incidents on 
    screen actually happened, especially the fire extinguisher sequence), 
    but there is no denying the results. Powerful stuff and something to 
    chew on. The remake was supposed to be released to theaters, but went 
    directly to DVD, VOD and pay cable instead, probably because it was 
    considered too &quot;intellectual&quot; for normal audiences, even 
    though it contained such bankable stars as Adrien Brody and Forest 
    Whitaker (both Academy Award winners). I think it's about time 
    Hollywood gives the audience a little more credit than they do. We 
    are not all morons.</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

    noises and sees the cop (Kevin Durand) beat his wife constantly,

    abuse to the police, they not only disbelieve him because he's an

    empty and looks like it hasn't been lived in for years. When the

     NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT</A></B> (1984) is a good old-fashioned gore film, 
    the kind that use to get made in the 80's. Foregoing CGI for 
    practical effects (always a good thing), this film finds someone in a 
    Santa Claus suit murdering people in very graphic ways. Police Chief 
    Malcolm McDowell and Deputy Jaime King (who has some emotional 
    issues, like freezing-up when she has her weapon drawn) are 
    investigating the killings. Do they have something to do with an 
    occurance that happened in the King family's past? I won't tell, but 
    there is much to admire here; from the opening electrocution of 
    Brendan Fehr; graphic stabbings; a scythe-like object planted in a 
    soft-porn photographer's crotch; a topless girl running away from the 
    killer, only to have one of her legs cut off with an axe and then 
    having her whole body (including the amputated leg) graphically fed 
    to a woodchipper; a bullet to the head; a young, snotty girl getting 
    shocked with a cattle prod and then being run through with a skewer 
    and other gory mayhem. There's also a reproduction of Linnea 
    Quigley's death by antlers in this film, only this time the girl 
    isn't topless (there's plenty of nudity in the film, though). Her 
    boyfriend has his head cleaved in two with an axe. The ending is a 
    little pat, but it does manage to answer some very important 
    questions, as well as leaving the film wide-open for a sequel.

    (even though both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are listed as 
    Producers), but I am glad to say that my worries were for nothing. 
    This is more of a reimagining than a remake, although there are many 
    similarities, but most of them are cosmetic. Four friends go to a 
    cabin in the woods to help friend Mia (Jane Levy) kick her drug 
    habit. Her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) is part of that group and 
    brother and sister have been having issues since the suicide of their 
    mother a year earlier. Mia complains of a smell in the cabin (which 
    belongs to her and David's family) but, at first, they all just think 
    it is in Mia's mind because she is going through withdrawal. The 
    family dog, named &quot;Grandpa&quot;, uncovers the hidden door in 
    the floor that leads to the basement, where David and Eric (Lou 
    Taylor Pucci) discover a bunch of dead cats hanging from the ceiling 
    and the dreaded Book Of The Dead (we witness a horrible thing happen 
    in the basement in the film's prologue). When Eric recites a passage 
    from the book, an evil spirit takes over Mia's body and, from that 
    point on, it's a non-stop ride of death, dismemberment and things 
    that could be considered worse than death. Needless to say, if you 
    were expecting things to go the same way they did in the original <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">EVIL

    in 1983, when the original had to be released without a rating, but 
    comparing it to this 2013 remake, it would look like a PG-13 film 
    today). The gore and blood literally flies off the screen and the 
    audio helps tremendously to immerse you in the experience. 
    Director/co-screenwriter Fede Alvarez, in his first full-length 
    feature (he directed a few shorts before this), hits the ball out of 
    the park, making this film a memorable, bloody experience you won't 
    soon forget. The special effects, by Jason Durey and his crew, are 
    top-notch, but not for the faint of heart (especially Mia's 
    possession, which is a sort of tribute to the tree rape in the first 
    film). Make sure you stay through the end credits for a small, 
    welcome tribute to the first film. Expect a sequel to follow, since 
    it made more than triple its 17 million dollar budget in U.S. 
    theaters alone. My highest recommendation!</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     <A HREF="maniac_2012.htm">MANIAC</A></B> (2012) - I'm probably going 
    to get a lot of angry emails about this, but I was never a fan of 
    director William Lustig's <A HREF="maniac_1980.htm">unrated 1980 original</A>,
     except for some bloody gore (the always-memorable &quot;head

    a sweaty performance by the late Joe Spinell as photographer Frank 
    Zito. When I heard that Elijah Wood would be playing Spinell's part 
    in the remake, all I could do was shake my head and wonder what 
    director Franck Khalfoun (<B><A HREF="p2_2007.htm">P2</A></B> - 2007) 
    was smoking (William Lustig is one of this film's many Producers). 
    You know what? Wood is good as Frank and the film is told almost 
    entirely from his perspective, making it a somewhat original take 
    (screenplay by Alexandre Aja and Gr&eacute;gory Levasseur) on what it 
    is like to be in the head of a psychopathic serial killer. There is 
    plenty of unrated gore and nudity (which got the film banned in some 
    countries, such as New Zealand, because, God forbid that you mix both 
    sex and violence in a horror film today) and the film moves at a much 
    quicker pace than the original. <B><A HREF="maniac_2012b.htm">MANIAC</A></B>

    (2014) - Besides seeing the Orion Pictures logo on a film for the 
    first time since 1996 (it will be used for limited theatrical and VOD 
    releases), this film is more of a crazy mash-up of the first <A HREF="town_that_dreaded_sundown_1976.htm">1976
     film of the same name</A> than an actual remake. It's 63 years after 
    the real-life murders by &quot;The Phantom&quot; have gone unsolved 
    in the town of Texarkana. Every year since 1976, the town has a 
    Halloween drive-in showing of the original film and this year Jami 
    (Addison Timlin) and her boyfriend Corey (Spencer Treat Clark) decide 
    to ditch the showing for a little sexual fun in the woods, but they 
    are attacked by someone dressed as The Phantom and Corey is killed. 
    Jami escapes and, with the help of her grandmother Lillian (Veronica 
    Cartwright), try to decide if history is repeating itself (Lillian 
    lived through the original murder spree) or if something more 
    sinister is going on. I will not spoil it for viewers, except to say 
    that this film is more of a gory slasher film than the original, but 
    there is some great intercutting between the original film and the 
    new film during some of the murders. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon 
    (who, at the time of this writing, has directed 12 episodes of TV's <B><A HREF="american_horror_story_tv_series_2011.htm">AMERICAN
     HORROR STORY</A></B>) infuses the film with a sense of fun as well 
    as some intense kills and it may want younger viewers to search out a 
    copy of the original film, directed by the late Charles B. Pierce 
    (who can be seen in footage from the original film here). It 
    shouldn't be too hard to find, since <A HREF="http://www.screamfactorydvd.com">Scream
     Factory</A> released a nice <A HREF="town_that_dreaded_sundown_1977_the_evictors_1979_blu-ray_and_dvd.htm">Blu-Ray</A> 
    of it that also contains a DVD of Pierce's follow-up period film <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Evictors1979">THE
     EVICTORS</A></B> (1979). That right there is a good thing, but the 
    new film itself is entertaining in its own right. I would advise 
    viewers that have never seen the original to watch it first before 
    seeing this film to get the full effect. Nice to have a new film this 
    entertaining not pander to the original film. This is also one of the 
    last films of excellent character actor Ed Lauter and also stars 
    Anthony Anderson, Gary Cole, Joshua Leonard, Edward Herrmann and 
    Denis O'Hare as Charles B. Pierce Jr. You can read my full review of

    (which was edited in order to receive a PG Rating when released to 
    the U.S. theaters in 1979) follows the original's very closely, it 
    has been updated to reflect the new technological age and has upped 
    the gore quotient substantially. The plot is very much the same: a 
    young woman named Kathy (Sharni Vinson; <B><A HREF="youre_next_2011.htm">YOU'RE
     NEXT</A></B> - 2011) takes a job in a small Australian coastal town 
    as a nurse to the comatose in an ex-convent-turned-hospital, run the 
    the seemingly sinister Dr. Roget (Charles Dance; he played &quot;Tywin
     Lannister&quot; on HBO's <B><A HREF="game_of_thrones_tv_series_2011.htm">GAME
     OF THRONES</A></B> until his memorable death at the end of Season 4

    unrecognizable Rachel Griffiths; HBO's <B><A HREF="six_feet_under_tv_series_2001-2005.htm">SIX
     FEET UNDER</A></B> - 2001-2005). Kathy is shown the ropes by fellow 
    Nurse Williams (Peta Sergeant; TV's short-lived <B><A HREF="once_upon_a_time_in_wonderland_tv_series_2013.htm">ONCE
     UPON A TIME IN WONDERLAND</A></B> - 2013-2014), who introduces her 
    to their comatose patients, including the open-eyed Patrick (Jackson 
    Gallagher), who is kept in his own room and is frequently injected 
    with Dr. Roget's unknown serum (he is basically Dr. Roget's guinea 
    pig). Patrick spits in Kathy's face and is told by Nurse Williams 
    that this is an involuntary reflex, but Kathy seems to think that 
    Patrick is trying to communicate with her (he is). Patrick has the 
    ability to make people do what he wants with his telekinetic powers 
    and he sets his sights on &quot;protecting&quot; Kathy, at first 
    communicating with her by spitting (one spit for yes, two spits for 
    no) and then having control of a computer's keyboard, typing out that 
    he is looking out for Kathy's best interests. Patrick will only show 
    Kathy that he is able to communicate and when she tries to show Dr. 
    Roget that Patrick is not comatose, he does nothing to respond. 
    Things turn deadly when anyone shows an interest in Kathy, including 
    her ex-boyfriend Ed (Damon Gameau), who is forced by Patrick's mind 
    control to put both his hands on a George Foreman grill (!), burning 
    both his hands until the flesh melts off and then killing 
    psychiatrist/new boyfriend Brian (Martin Crewes; <B><A HREF="resident_evil_2002.htm">RESIDENT
     EVIL</A></B> - 2002) by taking over his car and driving him over a 
    cliff (but first he takes control of Brian's body and spits in 
    Karen's face, showing her the powers he has). For patient viewers 
    (this film does move at a leisurely pace), the final 25 minutes will 
    be an edge-of-the-seat thriller, complete with gory deaths (including 
    a graphic electrocution followed by eyeball-popping), as the real 
    reason why Patrick is in a coma is revealed (it's the same reason as 
    the first film, only much more graphic and nudity-filled) and Kathy 
    realizes that Patrick is not so innocent as he makes himself out to 
    be. A running joke about a horribly burned patient named Morris (Rod 
    Mullinar), who is trained by Dr. Roget to turn on the lighthouse at 
    exactly 7:00AM every morning, actually plays an important part in the 
    finale. Documentary filmaker Mark Hartley (<B><A HREF="not_quite_hollywood_2008.htm">NOT

    sprinkles it with homages to late director Richard Franklin's 
    original (which was written by Australian master screenwriter Everett 
    De Roche; the remake was written by newcomer Justin King), including 
    Charles Dance listening to Brian May's original music from the 1978 
    film in his headphones (the soundtrack music was replaced by a Goblin 
    score in Europe; Dario Argeno scorer Pino Donnagio does the music in 
    the remake) and having Ed's last name as Penhaligon, a tribute to 
    Susan Penhaligon, who played Kathy in the original film. Antony I. 
    Ginnane produced both the original and the remake. The original did 
    inspire an unrelated 1980 Italian film, <B><A HREF="patrick_still_lives_1980.htm">PATRICK
     STILL LIVES</A></B> (<I>&quot;Patrick Vive Ancora&quot;</I>) and 
    this remake does end with the words &quot;Patrick Vive&quot;, which 
    means that it is left open for a possible real sequel in the future. 
    Worth a look for those that were fond of Australia's Golden Age Of 
    Horror, which ran from the mid-70's to the mid-80's. This is a really 
    good film that evokes that time period and has a real gothic feel, 
    while not making it seem dated. I enjoyed it and so should you. Also

    loved master director <A HREF="beguiled_1971.htm">Don Siegel's 1971 film</A> 
    starring Clint Eastwood because it dripped in gothic atmosphere and, 
    at the time, it was the most unusual film Eastwood ever starred in 
    (to show you how old I am, I saw it in a theater and people were 
    complaining that this wasn't a normal Eastwood film; some even walked 
    out!), but director Sofia Coppola, who had indeed inherited her 
    father's genes (some may say she surpassed them), has turned out a 
    really excellent reboot of the original with a few twists (Coppola 
    has said this is not a remake of the original film, but a adaptation 
    of the Thomas Cullinan novel). Unlike the original, this take place 
    in Virginia (the first film took place in Mississippi, even though 
    both films were made in Louisiana) and star Colin Farrell (who was 
    born the same year the original film was released) has never been 
    better. Just like the first film, Farrell plays a wounded Union 
    deserter, Corporal John McBurney, who stumbles across a secluded 
    girls school and they keep him as a prisoner. At first, he doesn't 
    know he is a prisoner and the Matriach, Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman, 
    who is excellent as a repressed woman discovering her sexuality), 
    doesn't approve of him being there because she fears that he will 
    undo all the girls' teachings on how to be a proper lady. Farrell 
    plays the role quite differently than Eastwood, which makes this film 
    quite a different watch than the original. He is trickster, master 
    manipulator and seducer, as he makes the girls feel uneasy (portrayed 
    by Elle Fanning, Kirsten Dunst and others; all very good) and they 
    begin to blossom as women. They end up back-stabbing their friends in 
    order to be close to John. Not giving away the ending, it is a 
    wonderful film to watch , as cinematographer Philippe Le Sourdgives 
    this film a sumptuous look. You will feel that you are actually in 
    the time period. Excellently acted by everyone involved, this is one 
    film you should not turn your back on. Coppola inserts crafty 
    feminist touches to the film that you will only realize long after 
    the film is over. Highly recommended, but it bombed at the boxoffice, 
    even though Sofia Coppola won Best Director at the 2017 Cannes Film 
    Festival. Discover it for yourself.</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     WISH</A></B> (2018) - First let me get this off my chest: For all 
    you Eli Roth haters out there, let me say this to you: FUCK YOU!!! I 
    am sick of hearing you haters say &quot;I heard this sucked&quot; or 
    &quot;It sucks balls&quot;, because it only shows how immature you 
    actually are. Hearing it sucks just shows you didn't even bother to 
    watch it and have no desire to. Saying that it sucks balls only 
    proves to me that you are nothing by a childish dweeb who refuses to 
    actually say what you really think. I doubt you know how. With that 
    off my chest, let's get down to the film. I don't think Bruce Willis 
    was the best choice to play Paul Kersey (Liam Neeson would have been 
    better), but I have to say it looks like Willis is having a good time 
    here, something we haven't seen from him in a long, long time and 
    it's refreshing. In this film Paul Kersey is a trauma surgeon in an 
    emergency room hospital and while he is working, his wife Lucy 
    (Elisabeth Shue) and daughter Jordan (Camila Morrone) are attacked in 
    their home by three scumbags in search of money. Lucy is shot and 
    killed and Jordan is put in a coma (it's never made clear what caused 
    her to slip into one, although rape is implied). Paul, who is a 
    pascifist, relies on the police to find the culprits until he visits 
    Detective Kevin Raines' (Dean Norris) office and takes a look at his 
    bulletin board of unsolved cases (look at photo <A HREF="death_wish_2018_were_gonna_need_a_bigger_board_photo.htm">HERE</A>)
     and realizes that if the scumbags are to be caught, he will have to 
    do it on his own. He steals a gun from one of the gangbangers he is 
    operating on and with evidence he obtains from his own operating 
    room, goes after the trio of thieving rapists and anyone else who 
    gets in his way. Punishment is quick and extremely bloody (Especially 
    what happens to the mechanic in the garage, a ballet of home surgery 
    and brain matter), as Paul becomes an internet vigilante hero, dubbed 
    &quot;The Grim Reaper&quot;, a champion for all the innocent folk who 
    are abused by the guilty. While Willis is no Charles Bronson (Who 
    is?), he is more than a servicable action hero and Eli Roth supplies 
    enough violence to make us wonder how this got by with an R Rating. 
    This is a pretty good reboot of the <A HREF="death_wish_1974.htm">1974
     original</A> that overlooks all the Cannon sequels, updating the 
    film with modern-day technology, as Willis get all his instructions 
    on how to be a vigilante from internet videos (!) and other on-line 
    instructional manuals. This film is not without a sense of humor and 
    Vincent D'Onofrio registers here as Paul's brother Frank, an ex-con 
    who becomes Paul's moral compass (it's obvious that they love each 
    other very much). Even though this was considered a box office bomb, 
    barely making back it $30,000,000 price tag in the U.S., that by no 
    means makes it a bad film. It's just that the timing of its release 
    was poor. People didn't want to see a vigilante movie when trust in 
    the police was at an all-time low. My advice? Forget all the 
    naysayers and rent or buy this film today. You should have a good 
    time with it.</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

    many vehicles Halicki (who was seriously hurt during one driving 
    stunt and filming has to stop for a few weeks) could destroy in 105 
    minutes (Total: 93 cars). In the remake, retired car thief Nicolas 
    Cage (there's that name again!) and his crew (including a pre-fame 
    Angelina Jolie) must steal 50 cars in one night to save his worthless 
    brother's (Giovanni Ribisi) life from an even more worthless Russian 
    crime lord who plans on shipping the pricey cars overseas (The remake 
    pays tribute to the original by naming the last car to be stolen 
    &quot;Eleanor&quot;. In the remake, it's a 1967 Mustang Fastback. In 
    the original, it's a 1973 Mustang.). They must do this while being 
    watched by a detective (Delroy Lindo) with a hard-on for Cage. Sure, 
    there are plentiful cars chases and one good scene of a police car 
    getting hit by a wrecking ball, but if you want a true high amount of 
    car crashes, then Halicki's film is the only way to go.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    (music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim), but Burton (who based his

    singing department and the gore department, many scenes at the same 
    time. The blood literally gushes like a waterfall on the screen, 
    while Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter (Mrs. Tim Burton), Alan 
    Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen warble their way to advance the story. 
    The film is great to look at (Art Director Dante Ferretti deservedly 
    won an Academy Award), but painful on the ears whenever we have to 
    listen to Depp sing. If Burton filmed this story straight without the 
    music, it would probably be considered a classic of the macabre. 
    Right now whenever you mention the film, a lot of people will say, 
    &quot;Isn't it that awful film where Johnny Depp sings?&quot; It's 
    hard to imagine who Burton made this film for. It's way too bloody 
    for the Broadway crowd and the music numbers will not make teens and 
    twenty-somethings leave the theater humming. It's not awful, but just 
    a step above average (I'm still trying to wrap my head around how

    green screen, much in the same vein of <B><A HREF="sin_city_2005.htm">SIN
     CITY</A></B> (2005) and <B><A HREF="300_2006.htm">300</A></B> 
    (2006), both of which Miller was involved in. While I enjoyed both of 
    those films immensely, this 2008 comic adaptation is severely 
    lacking. The only good thing about this film is Samuel L. Jackson as 
    the Octopus, otherwise it is just an over-stylized arty filmic 
    graphic novel that just screams &quot;Look at me!&quot; Films 
    shouldn't do that. You should just be able to sit down, relax and 
    enjoy the film. You can't do that with this film. Audiences thought 
    so, too, because it bombed at the box office.</FONT></FONT><BR>

     A REASONABLE DOUBT</A></B> (2009) - Anyone who would try to remake 
    one of director Fritz Lang's best 1950's noir thrillers (in this 
    case, his <A HREF="beyond_a_reasonable_doubt_1956.htm">1956 film of 
    the same name</A>) is a fool in my book. The &quot;surprise&quot; 
    ending is telegraphed way before the film ends (especially if you 
    have seen Lang's version) and star Michael Douglas has very little to 
    do here besides concerned that Jesse Metcalfe is looking into his 
    corrupt lawyer behavior. Metcalfe has himself arrested and brought to 
    trial to prove what a corrupt lawyer Douglas is, but the big 
    &quot;reveal&quot; at the ends proves that not everything you see or 
    hear is true. Do yourself a favor and watch Lang's version instead. 
    New version director Peter Hyams bit off a little more than he could 
    chew when he took on Lang. I think if Alfred Hitchcock were alive 
    today, he wouldn't touch Lang's films with a ten foot pole because 
    you don't mess with perfection.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    remake of <A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">Hitchcock's 1960 classic</A> is 
    one of filmdom's worst bonehead moves of all times. Somehow, indie 
    director Gus Van Sant thought it would be a good idea to take Joseph 
    Stefano's screenplay, the same one that Hitchcock used and film a new 
    version of Hitchcock's film, with Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates and 
    Anne Hecht as Marion Crane. Let's just say that this experiment was a 
    total failure and leave it at that. The only difference (besides the 
    talent behind and in front of the camera) is that the new version is 
    in color, where the original was in black &amp; white. The only 
    conclusion I can come to here is that this film was made to get 
    people to watch a version of the film in color, since a lot of young 
    people refuse to watch anything in black &amp; white. Don't laugh, I 
    know people who have this exact mindset. And yes, they are hipster

    be Shaft. The original was such an important film in so many ways 
    (take it from me, I lived those years). It was just one of a handful 
    of films that created the blaxploitation craze, which would last 
    until the mid-70's (besides an occasional film or comedy send-up over 
    the years), but it was different than most blaxploitation films. For 
    one, not every white character in the film was a bad guy or corrupt, 
    which would soon disappear in most blaxploitation films that followed 
    it. Secondly, Richard Roundtree was the essence of cool, not taking

    Hayes, who would later play <B><A HREF="truck_turner_1974.htm">TRUCK TURNER</A></B>

    (2003) - If you have been reading my comments about comic book 
    superheroes made into films, you already know that I really don't 
    care for them (although there are a few which are truly exceptional) 
    and this film is one of the bad ones. The Daredevil, who is a blind 
    lawyer named Matt Murdock (here portrayed by Ben Affleck, who is now 
    deservingly winning much praise as a director/actor, but back when 
    this film was made, critics and audiences were about to have the bad 
    taste of <B><A HREF="gigli_2003.htm">GIGLI</A></B> [2003] on their 
    minds due to his much-publicized romance with co-star Jennifer Lopez, 
    the paparazzi dubbing them &quot;Bennifer&quot;) was first given the 
    live-action treatment in the 1989 TV Movie <B><A HREF="trial_of_the_incredible_hulk_1989.htm">THE
     TRIAL OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK</A></B> (in which Rex Smith portrayed 
    the Daredevil), roams the rooftops of buildings looking for crooks to 
    capture with his tricked-out blindman's cane. He does such a good job 
    of cutting crime in the city that he pisses-off the city's biggest 
    crime lord, the Kingpin (portrayed by the late Michael Clarke 
    Duncan), who hires supreme bad guy Bullseye (Colin Farrell, whose 
    name is getting plenty of mentions on both the good and bad remake 
    lists), whose motto is &quot;I never miss.&quot;, to kill the 
    Daredevil. The film has some good points (especially in the R-Rated 
    Director's cut which restores a whole courtroom subplot featuring 
    rapper Coolio; the film was rated PG-13 in theaters and on the 
    original DVD and VHS releases), such as the Daredevil's final fight 
    with both Bullseye (who has a funny scene after the closing credits) 
    and the Kingpin and the hilarious banter between Murdock and best 
    friend/law partner &quot;Foggy&quot; (Jon Favreau, who went on to 
    direct one of the best superhero films, <B><A HREF="iron_man_2008.htm">IRON
     MAN</A></B> - 2008), but it is really unexceptional in the canons of 
    superhero mythology (especially the way Matt Murdock is blinded as a 
    child). As usual for a Marvel comics-turned-film, Stan Lee puts in a 
    cameo. Look for director/comic book geek Kevin Smith as &quot;Jack 
    Kirby, Forensic Assistant&quot; (Smith also wrote some Daredevil 
    comics and suggested Affleck play the title character to director 
    Mark Steven Johnson). Jennifer Garner (whom Affleck married in 2005) 
    co-stars here as another superhero, who got her own spin-off film, <B><A HREF="elektra_2005.htm">ELEKTRA</A></B>,

    can drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco in 
    just fifteen hours (and becomes an American hero in the process, 
    avoiding roadblocks and police chases) and the late Cleavon Little 
    (as blind DJ Super Soul, who keeps the country updated on his 
    progress, also dropping clues to Kowalski on the air) has one of the 
    most depressing endings of any film that I can ever remember. To 
    remake it as a 1997 TV Movie starring Viggo Mortensen as Kowalski 
    (who, in a change of the original's story, is racing 1200 miles [in 
    what looks to be a 1972, not 1970, White Dodge Challenger] to be with 
    his wife, who is pregnant and in labor) and Jason Priestly as a 
    Howard Stern-type radio DJ who helps Kowalski avoid psychopathic 
    State Trooper Steve Railsback, is one of the most boneheaded moves in 
    TV history. Gone are the naked lady on the motorcycle (in the remake, 
    the girl on the motorcycle, played by Peta Wilson, is clothed in a 
    bikini top and cut-off denim shorts), along with any shred of filmic 
    dignity. The ending of the remake is especially maddening, because it 
    defies not only all the laws of physics, but also how much damage a 
    body can take rolling out of a car going 150 MPH. A total disgrace 
    from beginning to end.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Demme cast Mark Wahlberg (who has been mentioned a lot in these best

    Hepburn role and Tim Robbins in the Walter Matthau role. The plot of

    original. But don't take my word for it. Buy the special edition

    directed by Frederick King Keller (who went on to become a popular TV

    other film. The story is simple: A twelve year-old girl named Winne 
    Foster (Margaret Chamberlain) takes a walk in the woods and meets 17 
    year-old Jesse Tuck (Paul Flessa), who brings her back home after 
    some trepidation to meet his family, headed by Angus Tuck (played by

    they became immortal and will never age. How Winne handles the secret 
    is the crux of the story and there's and immortal turtle subplot (in 
    the book, it was an immortal frog). Yes, the original film runs very 
    slow and may try some people's patience, but stick with it because I 
    guarantee you will not have a dry eye after it ends. The Disney 
    remake makes Winne a few years older (to keep those dreaded 
    pedophiles from jerking-off in the theater), but the story is not 
    about romance between a girl and an immortal boy, it's about love of 
    a family cursed to outlive everyone. I quess the theme got lost on

    the way to go. If you like truly independent films, find the 1981

    (2000) - This remake of the <A HREF="dune_1984.htm">1984 original 
    directed by David Lynch</A> are both based on the same novel by Frank 
    Herbert. It was shown in a trunicated version as a mini-series (265 
    minutes) on the Sci-Fi Channel (now SyFy) shorn of some violence and 
    all of the nudity, making some of the scenes seem downright strange 
    (nudity is a very important element in this version, especially 
    during one scene) and the first U.S. DVD released of this mini-series 
    was the same as the one shown on the Sci-Fi Channel. The only way to 
    watch this version is to purchase or rent the Director's Cut DVD 
    which runs 286 minutes. It restores all the nudity and violence 
    missing from the American TV version (The British TV version ran 280 
    minutes). Even with everything restored to its original glory, I 
    still much prefer the extended 180 minute-plus David Lynch version 
    (even though Lynch disowns this version). To me, at least, it 
    contains more heart and soul than the mini-series and the Lynchian

     BOURNE IDENTITY</A></B> - 2002) watched the Charles Bronson film <B><A HREF="breakout_1975.htm">BREAKOUT</A></B> 
    (1975) one too many times and either unconsciously remade the film or 
    did it on purpose. Watch the films back-to-back and decide for 
    yourself. Besides Hackford's film being an overlong 135 minutes, the 
    similarities between the two films are astounding. I remember when 
    watching the Hackford film for the first time that a sense of deja vu 
    came across me until I realized that it was the same exact plot (with 
    some romance thrown-in the Hackford film to give it the bloated 
    running time) when I went to bed that night. I pulled out my copy of 
    the Bronson film (directed by Tom Gries; <B><A HREF="helter_skelter_1976.htm">HELTER
     SKELTER</A></B> - 1976, who died much too young of a heart attack 
    [while playing tennis] at age 54 in 1977) and, voila!, the deja vu 
    disappeared and remake fever hit me like a sickness. The Bronson 
    film, in my opinion, is much more enjoyable and, at 96 minutes, won't 
    try your patience (Hackford has a tendency to make films that are 
    overlong). Both films have a roster of fine actors, but the Bronson 
    film also had the late Sheree North (<B><A HREF="telefon_1977.htm">TELEFON</A></B> 
    - 1977) in a large role. I was always in love with Sheree North (who 
    passed away in 2005) as a teenager and that's why I remembered this 
    film so quickly after watching Hackford's film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    (1998) - Toho Films finally relented and allowed the United States to 
    make their own Godzilla film. What do we do with that responsibility? 
    Well, if you are director Roland Emmerich, you turn Godzilla into a 
    generic CGI dinosaur who looks nothing like the Godzilla in the films 
    that the Japanese started making in <A HREF="godzilla_films_1954-1977.htm">1954
     until 1985</A> (and then picked up once again from the <A HREF="godzilla_films_1989-2004.htm">90's
     into the new Millennium</A>, with a streamlined, but recognizable 
    Godzilla). In this &quot;remake&quot; the faux Godzilla attacks New 
    York City and it's up to Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Patillo 
    and comic relief Hank Azaria (as a news cameraman) to try to find a 
    way to get rid of the giant dinosaur. When the faux Godzilla lays 
    eggs in Madison Square Garden, the film turns into <B><A HREF="jurassic_park_1993.htm">JURASSIC
     PARK</A></B> (1993), where a bunch of baby faux Godzillas attack the 
    cast. This is the reason Toho Films hold the Godzilla franchise so 
    near and dear to them, frequently filing lawsuits to those who dare 
    use the name Godzilla to promote their moneymaker. This film shows 
    why we should admire Toho, rather than admonish them. This didn't 
    have to be a Godzilla film at all. It could have been made as a 
    sequel to the <B><A HREF="beast_from_20000_fanthoms_1953.htm">BEAST

    made the mega-bucks it raked-in at theaters. Godzilla lovers have a

    all those films we grew up watching as kids. News Update: Hollywood 
    will be making a <A HREF="godzilla_2014.htm">new Godzilla reboot</A> 
    slated to premiere May 2014 that promises to be more faithful to the

    miserably. Where director Robert Wise excelled at creating suspense

    town and an underground laboratory that tries to find a cure for it 
    (and did it all with a G Rating, something he wouldn't get away with

    nothing much happening in the long run. Think of the &quot;Bird 
    Flu&quot;, &quot;SARS&quot; and &quot;H5N1 Virus&quot; and all the 
    anxious and exaggerated press they all got. Did you anyone you know

    movie based on a Robin Cook novel and directed and written by Michael 
    Crichton. Coincidence? I think not. The original film was a 
    suspenseful thriller about a doctor who has suspicions that patients 
    are purposely being killed and having their organs harvested for 
    transplants to the highest bidders. The remake takes that same 
    premise and stretches it out to a two-day mini-series. What took 113 
    minutes to tell in the original suddenly turned into a 240 minute

    yourself. The fact that the remake was made in 2009 (I was unlucky

    was no great shakes (not to mention the many sequels), this remake of 
    the original is one of the most aggravating movies I have ever seen, 
    thanks to the headache-inducing performance of Kandyse McClure as the 
    wife of a Vietnam veteran (This film takes place in 1975). Her 
    constant whining and put-downs of her husband (especially her remarks 
    of calling him a baby and woman killer during his stretch in the 
    military) made me want to slap her silly and then tear her apart. 
    She's in the film much too long and when she finally does get killed 
    by all the children, it's more anti-climatic than satisfying, because 
    we never really see what they do to her. As a matter of fact, after 
    she is killed there is no reason to watch the rest of the film 
    because it is a boring piece of dried-up dog crap. What else did you 
    expect from a SyFy Original Movie? Originality? The Unrated DVD of 
    the film promises more graphic gore than the version shown on SyFy, 
    but I have no desire of ever rewatching this film again. The worst 
    part of the film is when the main adult protagonist (David Anders) is 
    running through the corn field to escape the children and has a Nam 
    flashback that he is being attacked by the enemy . He ends up 
    stabbing a very young boy in the neck (maybe his wife wasn't wrong) 
    and kills several more children. The only original idea in this film 
    is that the children display the town's adult corpses as mannequins 
    in store windows. Don't expexct to see &quot;He Who Walks Behind the 
    Rows&quot;, just your usual modern day ending where evil wins and the 
    film is left wide open for a sequel. A sequel that will never happen.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    compared to this Lifetime TV Movie (directed by Deborah Chow). The 
    story is about a cruel mother and her even crueler grandmother who 
    keep four kids hidden in the attic so their mother can inherit her 
    estranged father's fortune (they have since made up, but he can't 
    stand children). One of the biggest complaints of the original film 
    is that it ignored the incest angle between the two trapped teenage 
    brother and sister in the attic. The TV movie takes it a little 
    further (they kiss while she is wearing her bra and they sleep in the 
    same bed, but no nudity or mention of intercourse), but the ending is 
    so ridiculous, it seems like a set-up for an inevitable sequel. At 
    least the original film ended in a fashion where everything was 
    settled and the mother and grandmother got their just desserts. 
    There's none of that in this film. The grandmother (Ellen Burstyn, 
    who only holds a candle to the original's Louise Fletcher) is left 
    standing on a darkened staircase yelling for help (Ohhh, how scary) 
    and the mother (Heather Graham) gets clean away. The three kids (yes,

    poisoned cookie), after spending two years in the attic, instead 
    steal some money and other valuables, escape the house (with a

    scenes of hammer violence, but director Lee misses the subtleties of 
    the original. There is one funny scene where Brolin stares at a squid 
    swimming in a tank at a restaurant (in the original, the prisoner ate 
    the squid alive, a scene that shocked many people), but there's not 
    much to recommend here unless you are a violence junkie. Besides, 
    those of us who have seen the original know how the film ends and why 
    America keeps churning out remakes of Asian films still makes me 
    scratch my head. This film failed miserably at the boxoffice and 
    rightfully so. Spike Lee keeps saying the filmmaking business is full 
    of racists (Universal cut his film down from 140 minutes to 105 
    minutes), but it has been a long time since he has made a good film. 
    It's about time he looked in the mirror and saw who is really to 
    blame. Now he has the nerve to ask the public through Kickstarter to 
    fund his next film. This is a man who owns two mansions. The public 
    should demand their money back for being forced to sit through this 
    film. Lee can be talented when he wants to be (I absolutely love <B><A HREF="summer_of_sam_1999.htm">SUMMER

    committee, not by a single person. The fact that it is also Rated 
    PG-13 doesn't help, but even if this film was released on Blu-Ray and 
    DVD in an R-Rated or Unrated edition (it wasn't), it couldn't even be 
    considered a pimple on the original's ass. This is remaking at its 
    worse and should be avoided by all. Even director Jos&eacute; Padilha 
    grew so tired of the Hollywood System of making movies, he went back 
    to Rio to direct his next film. Doesn't that tell you something? I

    Remember what I wrote about remaking a Paul Verhoeven film in the 
    above <B><A HREF="robocop_2014.htm">ROBOCOP</A></B> review? Well 
    multiply that by ten when it comes to remaking a Roman Polanski film. 
    I may not care for Polanski as a human being (skipping the country to 
    avoid jail time in the rape of a 13 year-old girl), but the man could 
    sure make masterpieces when it came to films. Here, NBC makes a four 
    hour miniseries (with commercials, and plenty of them) of <A HREF="rosemarys_baby_1968.htm">Polanski's
     1968 masterpiece</A> of the supernatural about the conception of the 
    birth of the Devils's son in an apartment complex full of Devil 
    worshippers. In this remake, Zoe Saldana takes the role originally 
    created by Mia Farrow and let me just say this: If you refuse to have 
    your hair cut and decide to have an ill-fitting wig put on your head 
    instead, your are not committed to your role. There's plenty of 
    filler in this remake, directed by female Agnieszka Holland, and not 
    much suspense, which is why it was probably shown during the end of 
    the regular TV season. The screenplay, by James Wong and Scott 
    Abbott, takes plenty of liberties with Ira Levin's novel and the 
    ending is completely different from the original film (it's best not 
    to show the son of Satan and let your imagination take over as in the 
    original, but this mini-series doesn't follow that rule). If you want 
    to sit through four hours of pure tedium and boredom. by all means 
    watch this remake. All others should have the sense to stay away. 
    Nobody can out-Polanski Polanski.</FONT></FONT><BR>

     <A HREF="left_behind_2014.htm">LEFT BEHIND</A></B> (2014) - Well, 
    here we are at number 100 and wouldn't you know it, it's a Nicolas 
    Cage movie! This awful $16 million dollar remake of the DTV <A HREF="left_behind_series.htm">2000
     film</A> (which spun off 2 sequels) and series of religious novels 
    by Tim LaHaye &amp; Jerry B. Jenkins has married Cage playing a pilot 
    who is having an affair with a stewardess (escuse me, flight 
    attendent) because his wife suddenly has found God (Cage says, 
    &quot;Well, if she is going to have an affair, it might as well be 
    with Jesus!&quot;). All around him he see signs and people announcing 
    that the end of man and the Earth will come shortly, In other words, 
    The Rapture. It finally happens about an hour into the film when Cage 
    is piloting a commercial airliner to London (where he and his 
    mistress plan on going to a U2 concert!) and many of his passengers 
    just up and disappear. Since the air traffic controller tower and the 
    airport experiences the same phenomenon (as does the rest of the 
    world), Cage must find a way to land the plane and find his family to 
    see if they are OK (now he worries about them!). Cage is downbeat and 
    underplays the role, which is unusual for him, because he is usually 
    the one flinging his arms around and acting wildly. This film could 
    have used that to keep the audience awake, Instead this is a boring, 
    badly scripted and acted film with awful special effects and even 
    worse CGI. If this film takes off (pardon the pun) at the boxoffice 
    (initial reports show that it is doing dismally), there are plans on 
    making more films in the series, just like they did in the early 
    Millennium. Director Vic Armstrong is known best as a stuntman (the 
    only thing that is decent in this film are the stunts, which includes 
    the tipping of a school bus off a highway and a car crashing into a 
    mall), but he has directed a handful of features, including the 1993 
    Dolph Lundgren action film <B><A HREF="army_of_one_1993.htm">ARMY OF ONE</A></B> 
    (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="joshua_tree_1993.htm">JOSHUA TREE</A></B>), which 
    is so much better than this piece of religious claptrap (even 
    religious blogs are panning it). Co-screenwriter Paul LaLonde 
    produced and wrote the screenplay to the original 2000 film and 
    recently formed his own religious production company, Stoney Lake 
    Entertainment, to make faith-based films. This was his first one. If 
    boxoffice receipts are any indicators, it looks like he will be 
    making DTV flicks from now on. But these films always make their 
    budget back from home video sales, so who knows? All I know is the 
    2000 film (starring Kirk Cameron, who is still churning out 
    religious-themed films like <B><A HREF="saving_christmas_2014.htm">SAVING
     CHRISTMAS</A></B> - 2014) was no great shakes, but it was told in a 
    much simpler, more effective way. This one relies on too much 
    razzle-dazzle and not enough story. Rated PG-13, which is unusual for 
    faith-based films, so religious parents may not want to take their 
    kids and brainwash them using this movie as a starting point. The 
    only things kids will probably learn is that adultery can lead to The 
    Rapture. And that is just crazy. If that were true, it would have 
    happened years ago when my first wife cheated on me.</FONT></FONT><BR>

     <A HREF="poltergeist_2015.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B> (2015) - The 
    biggest difference between this disappointing remake of the <A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">Tobe
     Hooper/Steven Spielberg 1982 masterpiece</A>, is that the remake 
    offers little time for character development. It is only mere minutes 
    before Eric (Sam Rockwell; <B><A HREF="green_mile_1999.htm">THE GREEN MILE</A></B> 
    - 1999) and Amy Bowen (Rosemarie DeWitt; <B><A HREF="watch_2012.htm">THE
     WATCH</A></B> - 2012) and their three kids move into a troubled (as 
    in supernatural) house in a troubled (as in supernatural) 
    neighborhood before strange things happen, especially to their little 
    6 year-old girl Madison (Kennedi Clements; I guess using the name 
    &quot;Carol Anne&quot; would have been an insult to the memory of 
    dearly departed Heather O'Rourke), who talks to the closet in her 
    bedroom (which causes hair to rise with static electricity when they 
    touch the door handle, but they are unable to open it.) and puts her 
    hands on a static-filled 60&quot; HDTV (Is static even a thing with 
    high definition?) before telling everyone in the family &quot;They're 
    here!&quot; And then a few minutes later pre-teen son Griffin (Kyle 
    Catlett) is attacked by a clown doll in his bedroom and is grabbed by 
    a tree branch through his window. Then teenage daughter Kendra (Saxon 
    Sharbino) begins to hear strange things on her iPhone and sees the 
    ground outside their house turn to bubbling mud, while Madison 
    follows a stuffed walking teddy bear (with a horn in the middle of 
    its head!) into the closet and gets sucked into another dimension. 
    All this happens within the first 35 minutes and it only made me want 
    to watch the original all the more. I remember when Craig T. Nelson 
    and JoBeth Williams smoked a joint in their bedroom in the original 
    film and acted like parents you would want to have (Also missing is 
    the JoBeth Williams scene of supernaturally traveling the bedroom 
    walls and ceiling in her panties, as well as one of the 
    parapsychologists tearing away at his face in the mirror. All we get 
    is to see one of them almost get punctured with an electric drill.). 
    Here, the usually excellent Sam Rockwell has zero chemistry with 
    Rosemarie DeWitt and it hurts the film most of all. Yes, there are 
    state of the art special effects in this film (as far as a PG-13 
    Rating will let them go), but when they hire a group of 
    parapsychologists to clean the house, are unsuccessful and decide 
    they need to turn to a TV parapsychologist named Carrigan Burke 
    (Jared Harris; <B><A HREF="ward_2010.htm">THE WARD</A></B> - 2010; 
    the best thing about this film), the ex-husband of parapsychologist 
    Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Adams; <B><A HREF="brave_one_2007.htm">THE 
    BRAVE ONE</A></B> - 2007; in one of the few differences in the films) 
    to cleanse the house and get Madison back, it just all seemed too 
    familiar to hold the interest of anyone who grew up with the 
    original. Also missing is the James Karen character subplot of the 
    first film. This new version seems to be made for the &quot;I want it 
    now and I want it fast!&quot; teenage crowd, who probably never saw 
    the original. Director Gil Kenan (<B><A HREF="city_of_ember_2008.htm">CITY
     OF EMBER</A></B> - 2008) and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire (<B><A HREF="oz_the_great_and_powerful_2013.htm">OZ
     THE GREAT AND POWERFUL</A></B> - 2013) seemed to have taken the 
    original premise (so much so that all the writers of the original 
    film get screen story credit) and condensed it as much as they could 
    to still make sense (there was an extended cut on disc which added 8 
    minutes to the theatrical cut's 93 minutes, but it doesn't amount to 
    much). All it was to me was a waste of time. And it will be to all 
    the fans of the original film. Sometimes a little humanity and 
    humility go a long way in a film. This one has none. The fact that 
    Sam Raimi was one of the Producers only makes it all the more shameful.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Not only do the female cast (Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate

    oil and water, the story is a rip-off of the original film, but if it

    Paul Feig for letting this film be released in the state it was in 
    (some of the effects looked unfinished and some scenes just end and 
    another begins without any connective tissue). Filling the film with 
    cameos by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Annie Potts from the first

    me put it this way: This is supposed to be a comedy and I didn't 
    laugh once. This film was released in July of 2016 and as of 
    September 25, 2016 the film only made $127 million of its $140 
    million budget in the U.S. (and that's not counting promotion, TV 
    commercials and film distribution costs), so it can't be considered a 
    blockbuster (and there probably won't be a sequel like the <A HREF="ghostbusters_2_1989.htm">1989

    of insufferable footage to a film that seems like a lifetime to

    PG-13 remake of the <A HREF="point_break_1991.htm">R-Rated 1991 original</A> 
    has some great stunts, all done by experts in their field (skydiving, 
    motocross, climbing cliffs without ropes, diving off cliffs with 
    &quot;flying suits&quot; and parachutes, snowboarding and, of course, 
    surfing) and shot all over the world, all done with a minimum of 
    green screen or CGI (just like the original), but it is missing one 
    thing that the original version had in spades: an emotional core. 
    This new version deals with a group of eco-terrorists who rob banks 
    and businesses and then hand the money they stole over to the poor 
    (they skydive out of a plane and drop millions of dollars into a 
    small Mexican town). They also have no problem killing anyone who 
    gets in their way, so the FBI has Utah (Luke Bracey, the role created 
    by Keanu Reeves in the original), who lost a friend in a motocross 
    accident in (where eles?) Utah six years earlier when they were 
    showing off in the mountains (probably the film's best scene), to 
    infiltrate the gang, led by Bodhi (&Eacute;dgar Ram&iacute;rez, who 
    is no Patrick Swayze). Almost the rest of the story has been retooled 
    from the original, as Bodhi is an adrenaline junkie who has a plan of 
    8 stunts he and his team are to pull off after every robbery. Gone is 
    the memorable extended footchase that Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze 
    went through in the original (They have a short footchase in this 
    film, but Utah ends up killing the only female member of the group, 
    since they were all on motorcycles and wearing helmets (in a tribute 
    to the original, the helmets had pictures of Presidents on them, 
    since Swayze and his gang robbed banks while wearing rubber President 
    masks in the original). The relationship between Utah and Bodhi in 
    this version doesn't come close to Reeves and Swayze in the original, 
    who became good friends even though Utah knew he was going to have 
    arrest Bodhi soon (The new Utah doesn't have a bum knee like the 
    original Utah, but there is a scene mirroring the original where Utah 
    has a chance to shoot Bodhi, but decides against it and screams as he 
    shoots an entire clip into the air. That is really the only other 
    &quot;tribute&quot; to the original film, even if the ending is 
    similar). Director Ericson Core has a good eye for showing the stunts 
    to maximum effect (he was also the cinematographer; a lot of people 
    were hurt performing these stunts), but there is no comparison when 
    placed side-by-side with the original. The stunts may be more 
    dangerous, but the story rings hollow. Ray Winstone plays the same 
    guy Gary Busey does in the original, except he gets to live here 
    (Busey's death was one of the things in the original that made Utah 
    chase Bodhi for the next two years, but the remake just makes Utah 
    chase Bodhi because it is his job.) While not a bad film per se, it 
    is very inferior when compared to the original and bombed at the 
    boxoffice both here and abroad, earning a measly $28 million in the 
    U.S. on a $105 million budget. The film made approximately $133 
    million worldwide, but that is considered a major money loser. You 
    can buy a DVD/Blu-Ray with both films on it, so you can compare for 
    yourself. Some may find it a good film just for the stunts, but the 
    story is very poor and disappointing. And quit remaking R-Rated films 
    with inferior PG-13 remakes. While there is a lot of gunfire in this 
    new version, there is no blood to be seen. They just fall down when 
    shot. What's the point?</FONT></FONT><BR>

     <A HREF="cabin_fever_2015.htm">CABIN FEVER</A></B> (2015) - OK, now 
    will someone tell me who wanted practically a word for word remake 
    (or as they rather call it, a &quot;reboot&quot;) of director Eli 
    Roth's 2002 horror flick <B><A HREF="cabin_fever_2002.htm">CABIN FEVER</A></B>?
     Well it seems like director Travis Zariwny (who uses the name 
    &quot;Travis Z&quot; here) and screenwriter Randy Pearlstein (who 
    used most of Eli Roth's script verbatim) filmed their own version of <B><A HREF="cabin_fever_2015.htm">CABIN
     FEVER</A></B> in 2015, with Eli Roth's blessing (he is one of this 
    film's Executive Producers and puts in an uncredited cameo) and made 
    this idiotic piece of deja vu, only with worse actors and some comedy 
    that falls flatter than a ten year-old girl's chest. The only real 
    difference between the two films is the opening of the new one, where 
    a guy camping out in the woods returns with a dead rabbit and tells 
    his dog that they now have dinner. He turns the dog over and it 
    sprays him in the face with blood. The dog's name? PanCakes (a take 
    off on a certain scene in the original). The rest of the film is 
    basically an exact retread of the original, only with two 
    differences: 1.) Instead of the partying cop Detective Winston 
    (Giuseppe Andrews), this films does a gender reversal and Detective 
    Winston is now a female partying cop, played by Louise Linton (who 
    gets less screen time than Giuseppe) and 2.) instead of the group 
    having a single-shot rifle, they now have a fully automatic rifle 
    (Stupid gun laws. How does an older teenager get his hands on a full 
    auto?). This film also ups the gore factor than the 2002 film, but 
    the original was much better acted and we never knew what was going 
    to happen (and it was gory enough), only here, 13 years later, we 
    know EXACTLY what is going to happen. No surprises, nothing new. Oh, 
    and it completely omits the old man in the backwoods store and his 
    iconic line to the three black people who walk into his store at the 
    finale (We have to be politically correct now and it pisses me off!). 
    Instead, they substitute a scene that leaves this film wide open for 
    a sequel that I hope never happens. It makes me wonder why this film 
    was greenlit so soon after the original. It is Rated R, so anyone 
    born in 2002 would still not be legally able to see it without a 
    parent or guardian, Sometimes it boggles the mind that people would 
    remake a film that already had <A HREF="cabin_fever_2_spring_fever_2009.htm">two</A> <A HREF="cabin_fever_patient_zero_2014.htm">sequels</A> 
    and do it so soon (one sequel was made a year before this film!). 
    Doesn't anyone have an original idea in their heads? If you feel you 
    must see this film, remember one thing: It went the basic limited 
    theater/VOD route in 2016 before being dumped on Home Video and Cable 
    TV. If you haven't seen the original film, I would recommend that you 
    watch that one instead because it was a quasi-hit back in 2002 and 
    for a reason. It was somewhat original in its ideas and was acted so 
    much better than this one. This new reboot is for masochists only. 
    Especially if you have seen the original. This reminds me so much as 
    when director Gus Van Sant tried to remake Alfred Hitchcock's <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> 
    (1960) word-for-word, scene-for-scene in <A HREF="psycho_1999.htm">1998</A>.

    miles away and, as they get to the plane, discover that they are 
    surrounded by drooling dogs ready to use them as chew toys. It looks 
    like the entire world now has a severe vicious dog problem. THE END. 
    All I can say is Eric Red (who has said he tried to shoot this film 
    with the same color gel lighting as Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="suspiria_1977.htm">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
    - 1977!) must have needed the work because this film contains none of 
    his regular suspenseful scenes (even the other <B>THE PACK</B> copy, 
    2006's <B><A HREF="breed_2006.htm">THE BREED</A></B>, was much more 
    entertaining than this) and since this was made for TV (Rated TV-14), 
    there is some blood and minimal gore, but not enough to make you take 
    notice as much as you will notice The Asylum's crappy CGI. If you 
    want to remake a film that offers thrills and bloody situations 
    galore, do not make it for TV. A film like this needs to be made for 
    theaters or DTV. Of course, The Asylum released this on DVD as being 
    &quot;Unrated&quot; because DVDs do not usually use TV ratings 
    (unless they are TV Series Season box sets). If you watch this film, 
    you will find it hard to believe that Eric Red wrote the screenplays 
    for <B><A HREF="hitcher_1986.htm">THE HITCHER</A></B> (1986), <B><A HREF="near_dark_1987.htm">NEAR

    JEWEL OF THE SEVEN STARS</I>&quot; was villified by critics and 
    rightfully so. What critics failed to mention was that Hammer Film's <B><A HREF="blood_from_the_mummys_tomb_1971.htm">THE

    While I really didn't care much for Schumacher's version, this 2017

    the new version is Rated PG-13, so most of the violence is missing 
    and, although the story is the same basically the same, it makes a 
    huge difference. A group of medical students, this time headed by the 
    over-rated actress Ellen Page,&nbsp; medically induce death in their 
    fellow students so they can experience what is on &quot;the other

    students decide to be dead past the allotted time and they bring

     the cold hard truth and many Muslims won't like what I have to say. 
    To kill anyone under the pretense that a film abused their religion 
    and their diety is just cowardly and dastardly. The truth of the 
    matter is that the notorious badfilm &quot;<B><A HREF="innocence_of_muslims_2012.htm">INNOCENCE
     OF MUSLIMS</A></B>&quot; is just that: a bad film. To blame a bad 
    film furiously enough to kill innocent U.S. citizens abroad is about 
    as bad as it gets (And a big &quot;good job&quot; to YouTube for 
    refusing to pull the 12 minute clip of the film, even though they 
    were pressured by our own government; many of the politicians 
    stupidly thinking that this film is to blame for what went on in the 
    Middle East). It does not help your cause to portray Muslims as 
    peace-loving people, then kill Americans and it does not sit well 
    with the rest of of the non-Muslim world. If every film that 
    portrayed Christianity in a bad light were to cause the same 
    backlash, every member of Monty Python would be dead, as well as 
    Martin Scorcese. Now Iran is boycotting the Academy Awards because of 
    this really bad film (supposedly directed by Alan Roberts of <B><A HREF="panorama_blue_1974.htm">PANORAMA

    Christian Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, who is now under federal arrest

    sentence in absentia. This is the kind of bullshit that goes on in 
    the Middle East! Don't try and tell me it's a &quot;cultural 
    thing&quot;. It's stupidity in the name of religion at its worst.]) 
    and all I have to say is this: Good! Any country that continually 
    wants to destroy Israel and the Jews should not be allowed to 
    participate in any free world business and that includes their nutjob 
    leaders being allowed to come to New York and the United Nations and 
    spread their anti-Israel bullshit in front of leaders of other 
    countries (many who walk out as soon as they take the podium). Here's 
    my suggestion: Move the United Nations to Iran or Syria and see how 
    long it lasts there. America is truly the land of the free and that 
    includes freedom to say what you want about religion (How else do we 
    explain the continuing abuse by the late Fred Phelps' religious nut 
    of a church [Westboro Baptist Church] against gays and protesting at 
    American soldiers' funerals?) or anything else for that matter, but 
    that does not include killing people because they disagree or make 
    fun of your religion. Muslims think that killing Americans abroad is 
    the answer for the release of a bad film (Or at least that is what we 
    were first told. It turns out the killings at the American Embassy in 
    Syria was a terrorist attack and had nothing to do with the film.). 
    And this includes Muslims in America who are legal citizens. I'm sure 
    there are plenty of good Muslims all over the world, but if you want 
    the rest of the free world to change their mind, you have to speak-up 
    against all this violence. So far, I have not heard a peep, not even 
    when I asked my Muslim neighbors about it (They would rather not talk 
    about it. Saying nothing is the same as saying that you approve of 
    the killings, in my opinion). Mark my words, we will be going to war 
    against Iran within five years and when we do, we should kick-out 
    every Muslim in this country. I know my stance sounds too unrealistic 
    (and some may say racial, but so be it), but film is just that: Film. 
    There is no justification in the world to kill Americans (or any 
    other nationality), burn the American flag, issue death sentences and 
    storm U.S. Embassys abroad because of a movie. I don't care if you 
    think your religion allows it. Your religion is wrong. I'm glad I'm 
    an Athiest. I'm not offended by anything except people who think 
    their religion is the answer and try to force it down other people's 
    throats, going as far as killing innocent people to prove it. This is 
    not about understanding someone else's faith; it's about knowing that 
    killing a human being over a film that portrays the Prophet Mohammed 
    in a bad light is just plain wrong. Innocence Of Muslims indeed. We 
    are now living in perilous times, when forces we train in Afghanistan 
    to act as the new militia turn against us and kill the American 
    soldiers who trained them, so lets pull all our soldiers out of the 
    Middle East and let them fight amongst themselves. But as soon as 
    they target Israel, we should hit these countries with every weapon 
    we have. Every country has a right to exist, but there is no reason 
    they have to put up with Muslim bullshit. And to all those who think 
    I am Jewish because my name is Fred Adelman, all I can say is that 
    you are wrong. I am of German/Irish ancestry without a drop of Jewish 
    blood in my body, so my views about Muslims have nothing to do with 
    being a Jew. It's about being a proper human being with a conscience. <B>ADDENDUM</B>:
     I just saw the pictures of the Palestine rebels in Gaza dragging a 
    supposed &quot;Israeli spy&quot; on their motorcycles after they 
    killed him and three others without even a trial. How are we supposed 
    to deal with these people when they have no value on human life? <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cindy lee garcia photo small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="           Cindy Lee Garcia

    hide behind their own citizens after shelling Israel with rockets and 
    then complain that Israel killed innocent civilians when they 
    retaliate. They are nothing but spineless cowards. <B>UPDATE</B>: A 
    U.S. judge says that YouTube does not have to pull the 12 minute 
    video clip from their site, citing freedom of information, squashing 
    a claim by one of the film's actresses that her lines were looped 
    without her knowledge and therefore the clip must be removed. 
    Meanwhile, the U.N. practically kisses the Palestines' asses by 
    making them an &quot;almost&quot; state (they have no U.N. power, 
    yet), but take my word for it, the only country that will suffer 
    because of it is Israel. Shame, shame on the United Nations. Their 
    horns are showing. It seems there are spineless cowards everywhere. 
    Palestines never existed until the country of Israel was formed, so 
    they aren't even a real nation of people. All they are really are a 
    bunch of Jewish-hating people who would rather see Israel blown off 
    the map than to let them exist. Yet Israel lets Palestines work and 
    walk amongst them. That is the sign of a true sovereign nation. If 
    the U.N. allows Palestines to form their own country, it will only be 
    another place that will cause trouble for Israel. Now, I'm not saying 
    every Palestine person is like that (the years have softened some of 
    them to &quot;live and let live&quot;), but the true mission of 
    Palestine the nation is to kill Israel and blow it off the map. <B>UPDATE
     #2:</B> February 28. 2014: A higher court has made YouTube remove 
    the video because of a lawsuit brought on by the actress in the short 
    that said she never knew the film was going to be anti-Muslim. So let 
    me get this straight: Muslims can use their own versions of YouTube 
    to show the beheadings of American soldiers, journalists and other 
    people they deem against their religion, but the lame-ass U.S. 
    judicial system demands that YouTube pull the video from its roster 
    because some actress of no note says she was duped. YouTube is 
    fighting the court's decision and this will not be the end of the 
    story. One gets the feeling that the actress (Cindy Lee Garcia) 
    doesn't want to be the star of one of the radical Muslims beheading 
    videos. Or she wants money for her &quot;pain and suffering&quot;. 
    She doesn't know what suffering is. If she could, she should ask all 
    the beheaded people the suffering they went through before their 
    heads were seperated from their bodies by these Muslim infidels. Fuck 
    her and fuck the judicial system for letting this happen. I hope 
    YouTube comes out the winner here. More as the story develops.</FONT></FONT></P>

    the title in parenthesis because that's the name they gave the film 
    at the beginning of the closing credits (Early advance <A HREF="john_carter_of_mars_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/john carter of mars advance poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="195" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>posters
     used the &quot;Mars&quot; title or simply used a &quot;JCM&quot; 
    logo, which probably confused people even more). At the beginning of 
    the film, it is simply known as <B><A HREF="john_carter_2012.htm">JOHN
     CARTER</A></B>. I don't know why Disney released the film with this 
    moniker, because the teen audience it was made for (it's rated PG-13) 
    would have no idea that this film was based on an Edgar Rice 
    Burroughs story called &quot;A Princess Of Mars&quot; and wouldn't 
    know who the hell John Carter was. If they added the Mars part to the 
    opening title of the film (and the advertising materials), I believe 
    the film would not have been much of the flop that it turned out to 
    be in theaters (it lost tens of millions of dollars) because there is 
    a real interest in Mars right now, with the successful landing of the 
    latest Mars rover. Taylor Kitsch (who reminds me of a young Timothy 
    Olyphant) is good as John Carter and the CGI effects are better than 
    you find in most films (I think even better than <B><A HREF="avatar_2009.htm">AVATAR</A></B> 
    - 2009). I especially liked the Martian &quot;dog&quot; who followed 
    John Carter around (Jesus, that dog could move fast!) and the flying 
    machines that looked like giant dragon flies. Since this takes place 
    in the late 19th Century, it gives the story a little more punch than 
    if it were set during modern times. Don't blame 
    director/co-screenwriter Andrew Stanton (of Pixar fame; this is his 
    first live-action feature) for the film's failure because if Disney 
    hired a good public relations team, they would have had a winner on 
    their hands rather than a financial disaster (Rumor has it that 
    Disney insisted that the word &quot;Mars&quot; be removed from the 
    title because of thier under-performing animated feature <B><A HREF="mars_needs_moms_2011.htm">MARS
     NEEDS MOMS</A></B> in 2011 or that Stanton wanted the word removed 
    because most films with &quot;Mars&quot; in the title never fared 
    very well and he wanted to reach a &quot;broader&quot; audience. 
    While Stanton's claim may be true about the Mars thing, I can't see 
    the title &quot;John Carter&quot; reaching a broader audience.). 
    Catch it on DVD or cable (it is now playing on the Starz Networks) 
    when you can because I have seen a lot worse science fiction/fantasy 
    films make more money at the box office. This film deserves more 
    attention. Of course, <A HREF="http://www.theasylum.cc">The Asylum</A> 
    made their own ultra-cheap version of this film, using Burroughs' 
    almost original title <B><A HREF="princess_of_mars_2012.htm">PRINCESS 
    OF MARS</A></B> (2012; they probably left out the word &quot;A&quot; 
    to keep Burroughs' estate from suing them), set it during modern 
    times, used their usual dime-store CGI effects and had Antonio Sabato 
    Jr. and Traci Lords star in it! UPDATE: I just watched Taylor Kitsch 
    in his other big-budget disaster <B><A HREF="battleship_2012.htm">BATTLESHIP</A></B>

    of plot holes (Aliens want to take over Earth, but are compromised by 
    sunlight?), based on a Hasbro board game (which really doesn't have a 
    plot) and was overlong at 131 minutes (But what blockbuster isn't?), 
    but it was still a fairly exciting sci-fi/action film and director 
    Peter Berg (<B><A HREF="rundown_2003.htm">THE RUNDOWN</A></B> - 2003) 
    managed to keep things interesting for the full running time. I 
    particularly enjoyed the little remarks by the cast that related to 
    the board game and the alien designs were quite interesting (humanoid 
    in form with porcupine-like spikes for goatees), as were the alien

    There is a reason this web site and the previous zine it was based on 
    is called &quot;Critical Condition&quot;. It's not just a play on 
    words, but because I was declared legally dead three times (not 
    including that stupid FaceBook thing). The first time was when I was 
    riding a dirt bike down a previously unknown trail when I was a teen 
    and I rode it over a cliff, with the motorcycle landing on me. 
    Luckily, the guys I were with went and got the police (this was way 
    before cellphones), who then got the ambulance. I woke up three days 
    later to find out that I was declared legally dead by the paramedics, 
    but they eventually got my heart started after about four minutes. I 
    did manage to break my back and was in a full body cast for six 
    months. The second time I fell 30 feet out of a tree and landed on 
    concrete when I tried to retrieve someone's kite. Again, I was 
    declared legally dead, but the paramedics were able to get my heart 
    started. I went to the hospital and got x-rays and had no broken

    because it is still classified, but I wouldn't wish it on my worst

    I have written three books, but none of them have been published. The 
    first book, entitled &quot;Voices In The Water&quot; is an 
    autobiographical tale of all the supernatural stuff that has happened 
    to me during my life. It was supposed to be published by a major book 
    company, but they dropped it when the recession hit a few years ago. 
    I still have hope it will be published some day. I told some of the 
    stories on a film forum (which shall remain nameless, because I was 
    banned from there twice!), including my meeting with Mothman (it's 
    also in the first &quot;Weird New Jersey&quot; book) and &quot;The 
    Case Of The Ghostly Quarter&quot; and got some good feedback, so you 
    never know. My second book was about spending my time at local 
    &quot;grindhouses&quot; during my teens and early twenties and it is 
    titled &quot;It's Called A Movie Theater&quot; and is more about my 
    adventures at these theaters than the film themselves. I wrote this 
    book more for me than anyone else, just in case I start to forget 
    things later in my old age and have not submitted it to anyone. The 
    third book, &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot;, is a fictional novel 
    about religion and what it does to a group of friends over a period 
    of ten years. There's some autobiographical stuff in there (the 
    Athiest in the book is based partly on me and a devout Catholic girl 
    who has an affair with a married man is based on someone I know) and 
    I'm proud about the way it turned out. Believe me, if this book ever 
    saw the light of day in bookstores, it would be picketed by every 
    religious group known to man. That would be fine with me. <B>Addendum:</B> 
    I finally finished my fourth book &quot;There's Only Room 4-1&quot;, 
    which I have been working on for 20 years and finally came up with 
    what I think is the perfect ending (Believe it or not, it came to me 
    in a dream). I can guarantee this novel will not be making fans of 
    people of the religious persuasion, but the people I have loaned

    I was once bitten by a spider while sleeping. It was just an ordinary 
    house spider, but I must have swatted and killed it in my sleep. It 
    bit me on the opposite side of my right elbow and within two days it 
    got so bad (the bump was the size of a grapefruit!) that I had to be 
    taken to the hospital (I couldn't bend my arm). They drained the 
    wound and I was back to normal within a day, but I still have a fear 
    of small spiders (Surprisingly, I have no problem handling large 
    spiders like tarantulas or even black widows). I was told that no 
    matter where you are, even if you are on an airplane, you are no 
    farther than three feet from a spider. That just makes my skin crawl.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I hate holidays and the greed and avarice it brings out in people. I 
    especially feel sorry for people who work in retail stores and have 
    to work during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I remember when there was 
    no &quot;Black Friday&quot; or &quot;Cyber Monday&quot;. People just 
    did their shopping and that was it. Now, entire families go without 
    their Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys or ham to wait hours (or 
    days!) on long lines for deals that seem too good to be true (and 
    every year these stores open earlier and earlier). The only thing 
    these &quot;deals&quot; are doing is breaking down the family 
    dynamic. Is it no wonder that kids today feel entitled to everything? 
    If retail stores were smart, they would offer these same deals 
    starting in June or July and make more money and stop complaining 
    about poor sales during the Summer. Christ, I can't get one kid to 
    come to my apartment door during Halloween because their parents are 
    worried that everyone they don't know are pedophiles. These are the 
    same kids that are going to run our country one day. When I was a 
    kid, me and my friends would spend hours on our own collecting candy 
    from strangers. That's not to say my parents wouldn't inspect my haul 
    when I came home and throw away stuff that was suspect (especially 
    apples), but at least we were outside as a group having fun. Kids 
    today spend too much time in front of the TV playing video games 
    believing playing their Nintendo Wii or X-Box 360 will make them fit. 
    Fit for what? Not running this country, that's for sure. From the 
    middle of November to the end of the year, I do all my shopping 
    (including food) on the internet because I don't want to have to deal 
    with kids saying &quot;I hate you!&quot; to their parents because 
    they won't buy them something. If I ever said that to my mother or 
    father when I was a kid, I wouldn't be able to sit down for a week.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    (1979) is my favorite movie of all time and I must have watched it 
    over 200 times. I can still remember the first time I saw this film 
    at the Fabian Theater in Paterson, N.J. and the crowd going wild 
    during some of the scenes. I'm not a religious person, but I 
    understand how they feel when &quot;God&quot; talks to them. This 
    film is as close to a religious experience that I have ever felt. 
    Everything just seemed to work for me. Yeah, I know the film is 
    nothing but an amalgam of earlier horror films, but &quot;The Tall 
    Man&quot; and the flying silver spheres were some of the most 
    frightening things I had seen at the time. I do enjoy the sequels, 
    but there's nothing to compare to the original.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    There's nothing more that I hate than directors fucking around with 
    their films long after they have played theaters. George Lucas added 
    more &quot;modern&quot; special effects to the first three <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR
     WARS</A></B> films (and changed some dialogue so they would jive 
    with his next three chapters) and Steven Spielberg digitally erased

    (1973) has gone through so many different versions, that the original 
    theatrical version is nearly impossible to find. Even beloved books 
    aren't exempt from such tampering, like &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; 
    by Mark Twain, where new editions of the novel replace the character 
    of &quot;Nigger Jim&quot; with just &quot;Jim&quot;. Revisionist 
    History seems to be the newest fad, so our kids will now grow up not 
    knowing what is real and what is altered. What does this actually 
    accomplish? Will somebody please tell me?</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>8)</B> 
    I have two cats, Allie (the female) and Gator (the male) and I love 
    them more than most of the people I know. I call them my 
    &quot;kids&quot; because that's exactly what they are, my children. 
    The funny thing is, when I was growing up, I couldn't stand cats. I 
    always had a dog. But since I moved from a house to an apartment in 
    the mid-80's and dogs are not allowed, I went to a shelter to get a 
    cat during the early 90's to give to my ex-wife as a Christmas 
    present (she was pestering me for nearly a year to get a cat, but I 
    didn't want one). My wife soon became extremely ill and spent several 
    months in the hospital, which meant every time I came home after 
    visiting my wife, I had to feed the cat. The cat, a male we called 
    Scooter (after Phil Rizzuto of the N.Y. Yankees), would spend the 
    whole night by my side, eventually laying on my lap every chance he 
    got. We really connected and I needed that, even though I'm sure he 
    knew I wasn't too keen on cats. Scooter changed my mind (he passed 
    away of feline leukemia in 1997 and I was sad for months and still 
    think about him all these years later) and when my wife finally came 
    home, she discovered that Scooter was no longer hers, so I went out 
    and picked up another rescue cat for her, a male we called Bailey. 
    That cat also passed away late in the 90's. Now that I live alone 
    with my two cats, I couldn't be happier because they both give me 
    nothing but unconditional love, something a human is incapable of 
    doing (I nearly lost Gator to diabetes, but I give him a shot of 
    insulin every morning and now he is fine). The trick is to get a 
    rescue cat when they are kittens so you can condition them to act the 
    way you want them to. You also have to show them affection and 
    attention so they don't become too independent and ignore you. Both 
    of my cats (who are &quot;indoor&quot; felines because you don't want 
    them getting hurt outside, especially where I live) love to play 
    &quot;fetch&quot; with their toy mice (I throw the mouse, they run 
    and get it and drop it at my feet) and they spend most of their other 
    time sleeping on my lap or on the bed next to me. Happiness truly is 
    a warm pussy.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I really don't have any enemies, but I firmly believe that William 
    Wilson is a horse's ass. I don't know what his agenda is or what he 
    has against me, but he continually keeps making veiled comments about 
    me on a certain forum I use to belong to (and it all pertains to my 
    Facebook account being hacked, which really had nothing to do with 
    him). Why don't you take a look at yourself in the mirror William or 
    do you think you are perfect and can randomly judge people without a 
    shred of proof? What exactly is your problem with me? Or do you think 
    that there is no room for competition? I hope you don't get sick and 
    have people call you a fraud. I don't work that way, but it's 
    apparent you do. To see how ridiculous Wilson can get, check out his

    I hate weathermen/women. Predicting the weather is like a

    played. If a weatherman/woman is right 15% of the time, I consider 
    that a decent percentage. Now, to cover their tracks, most TV weathermen/women
     give the viewer alternate scenarios on what tomorrow's weather could 
    be like, depending on where two or more systems will meet. I quit

    like having a crack addiction. I just can't get enough of this show 
    and was sadder than hell when the ten-episode first season ended. The 
    show is complex and hard to explain, but I'll try. When ex-con and 
    master thief Lucas Hood (Anthony Starr) is released from prison, a 
    series of circumstances happen where he becomes the sheriff of a 
    small Amish town in Pennsylvania called Banshee, which is not as 
    quiet as it appears. Lucas' former girlfriend Anastasia (Ivana 
    Milicevic) is living there under an assumed name and she is married 
    with two kids. The town is under the thumb of former 
    Amish-turned-crimelord Kai Proctor (Ulrich Thomsen), who not only 
    uses ultra-violence to get his way (he knocks the teeth out of one 
    citizen for calling his Amish father an ethnic slur and then makes 
    the guy put the teeth back in his mouth!), he also hopes to gain 
    control over a Native American casino in the area. Lucas continues 
    his thieving ways with the help of transexual computer expert Job 
    (Hoon Lee; my favorite character in the series) and old partner Sugar 
    Bates (the always welcome Frankie Faison), who now runs a bar, all 
    while he acts as a proper sheriff. There's also Anastasia's Russian 
    mobster father Mr. Rabbit (a white-haired Ben Cross, who is 
    excellent), who has been looking for his daughter for years and wants 
    to meet his grandson while making his daughter and Lucas pay for 
    their past sins. Most of the characters are bad people who do 
    despicable things (the way Job deals with a trio of rednecks in a 
    diner is a thing of beauty), but you'll fall in love with them 
    anyway. Every episode of this series is mesmerizing (and the final 
    episode of the season packs enough action for a dozen films) and can 
    be watched separately without catching the episodes before it (but it 
    sure helps if you do) and each episode ends with a stinger at the end 
    of the closing credits, so make sure you stay until the very end. To 
    say any more about the show would be to deprive you of my favorite TV 
    series of the 2012 - 2013 season. Either watch the repeats on Cinemax 
    or get the DVD/Blu-Ray when it is released. <B>NOTE:</B> I'm glad to 
    report that the Second Season started off in spectacular fashion. I 
    will give no details for those yet to see it other than to say that 
    it's even more violent this time (Check out the Bible beatdown in 
    Episode 2 or the decapitation by jacknifing truck in Episode 4!). To 
    see more about the characters in the show, go to <A HREF="http://www.welcometobanshee.com">welcometobanshee.com</A>

    The fourth season will sadly be the last and will premiere on April 
    1, 2016 [and, no, this is not an April Fool's joke]. My heart just 
    sunk, but it was one hell of a final season.). Cinemax also debuted 
    their new show <B><A HREF="knick_tv_series_2014.htm">THE KNICK</A></B>,
     starring Clive Owen, in August 2014. Based on what I have seen, it 
    will be an interesting show to watch (Oh my God, Doctor Thackery 
    [Clive Owen], died at the end of Season 2 [He kept it secret that he 
    only wanted to do two seasons]). Cinemax did order a third season, 
    though, but wants to look at a &quot;Premiere script&quot; and season 
    story plan before they continue. It's not like there's a shortage of 
    people to take Owens' place on the show. Showtime's new series, <B><A HREF="ray_donovan_tv_series_2013.htm">RAY

    It also gives Jon Voight the best character of his lifetime as Ray's 
    nemesis and ex-con father, just out of the joint (The advice he gives 
    his grandson in episode 2 will shock you). The first episode, titled 
    &quot;The Bat Or The Bag&quot;, would make The Hulk cringe in terror 
    (You'll have to see it to get the reference). Voight is absolutely 
    mesmerizing and menacing. Believe me when I say that you would never 
    want to be one of his enemies, but Ray knows how to get things done, 
    both by using the law and bending it until it almost breaks into a 
    million pieces. This is absorbing TV about a fractured family, 
    including Ray's brothers Terry (Eddie Marsan; <B><A HREF="hancock_2008.htm">HANCOCK</A></B>

    too excited about this show because it looks like there will be no

    Michael Ironside appeared as the main bad guy with absolutely no 
    introduction to his character. I guess we'll have to wait for the 
    eventual DVD/Blu-Ray release to see those skipped episodes.), which 
    is a shame because it's a classy show with a unique look and a great 
    cast (The New York Post, which seems more interested in putting down

     this show as one of the &quot;25 Worst TV Series of the 2012 - 2013

    think it is a much better show than the mind-numbing, boring, yet 
    somehow award-winning <B><A HREF="mad_men_tv_series_2007-2013.htm">MAD

    of followers (some of who are in law enforcement), who is chased down 
    by former FBI agent Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon), who captured Carroll 
    before but had a heart transplant afterwards that now limits his 
    capabilities (It concluded its first season in a tense cliffhanger 
    fashion, with a two major characters dying [maybe] and Ryan and 
    Carroll's ex-wife being stabbed by someone we haven't seen before. It 
    will be a Fox midseason replacement show for its second season on 
    January 19, 2014; It has already been renewed for a Season Three in 
    2015; The Second Season seems to play more like an unintentional 
    comedy with unbelievable plot twists and turns than being a straight 
    thriller. Let me put it this way: It is more preposterous than Season

    (2002), where troubled Special Agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) and FBI 
    agent Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne), whose wife has terminal 
    Stage 4 lung cancer that she was hiding from him, use psychiatrist 
    Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen, in an Emmy-worthy performance) 
    to help them solve crimes and to get a shell-shocked Graham back into 
    humanity (Eleven episodes in and it's still not working). Since we 
    all know the history between Graham and Lecter, it will be 
    interesting to see how long it will take Graham to realize he is 
    working in cahoots with a serial killer cannibal known as the

    regular player in the 2013 - 2014 midseason replacement series <B><A HREF="crisis_tv_series_2014.htm">CRISIS</A></B>,
     which was canceled). The series is bloody as hell for a network show 
    (I loved how guest star Eddie Izzard gave one of his enemies a 
    &quot;Colombian Necktie&quot;! The episode before it featured a death 
    known as a &quot;Glasgow Smile&quot;. Google them if you don't know 
    what they are.) and has an atmosphere not usually found during 
    network prime time (A big &quot;Boo!!!&quot; to the show for refusing 
    to televise Episode 4 of the series out of &quot;respect&quot; for 
    the Boston Marathon bombing [It's not even about a bombing. It's 
    about children being brainwashed into killing other children.]. They 
    plan on never showing it on TV, but it will be on the DVD/Blu-Ray of 
    Season 1 when it is released [They released &quot;webisodes&quot; of 
    it on the Internet, but completely edited out the plot and Molly 
    Shannon's appearance as the villain]. I think we, as a whole, are 
    mature enough to understand fact from fiction, but NBC and the makers 
    of the show think otherwise. This coming from a series about a person 
    who eats people! Apparently, the episode is only being pulled in the 
    United States. Those living outside the country will still be able to 
    watch the episode.). Otherwise, the regular TV network series are the 
    same old, same old. <B>UPDATE:</B> Episode 4 of <B>HANNIBAL</B>, 
    which still cannot be seen on U.S. TV, is now available for download <A HREF="under_the_dome_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/under the dome series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="176" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>on
     iTunes. Thanks to Michael Prymula for this information. This is the 
    reason why I don't get involved in network shows. Fifty percent of 
    the network shows I like will not survive to see a second season. The 
    ratings they got would be manna from Heaven for non-network shows, 
    but they just don't satisfy the advertisers who pay for commercials 
    on network prime time, especially the coveted 18 to 49 age bracket. 
    Older viewers like myself aren't even in the equation when it comes 
    to networks. As a matter of fact, some non-network shows do better in 
    the ratings during prime time than some network shows, which means 
    that the word &quot;network&quot; will probably disappear in about 
    ten years. Hopefully. At least cable TV series don't rely on huge 
    numbers to renew shows. Four million viewers is considered large on 
    cable, but would be certain death on networks. <B>NOTE:</B> Season 2 
    is getting dismal numbers, but I believe that is because NBC has it 
    on Fridays at 10:00pm opposite <B><A HREF="blue_bloods_tv_series_2010.htm">BLUE
     BLOODS</A></B>. Since <B>HANNIBAL</B> is the most adult show on 
    Network TV and the makers of the show have it mapped out to be a 
    three season series, maybe some enterprising non-network cable 
    station can pick up the series for the final season and make it even 
    more graphic (NBC announced in May 2014 that it would be renewed for 
    a third season). <B>UPDATE #2: </B>The new Summer 2013 CBS network 
    series <B><A HREF="under_the_dome_tv_series_2013.htm">UNDER THE DOME</A></B> 
    (which has been renewed for a second season 13-episode Summer series 
    starting on June 30, 2014, so don't expect any major resolutions this 
    season. It was then cancelled in 2015 after three seasons.) caught my 
    interest in the first couple of episodes, but like all things Stephen 
    King, I expect it to become more soap opera than fantasy/sci-fi. I'm 
    keeping my fingers crossed that it is not the case this time (The 
    final episode of Season 1 ended in typical cliffhanger style). Time 
    will tell, but it opened with huge numbers (nearly 13 million 
    viewers) and had some disturbing gory scenes for a network series 
    (especially the cow cut in half when the dome appeared). It's nice to 
    see that network TV is finally accepting that opening new shows 
    during the Summer is just as important as introducing them in the 
    Fall, since cable TV has been doing it for years and stealing away 
    network watchers in droves, including such scripted series as TNT's <B><A HREF="major_crimes_tv_series_2012.htm">MAJOR

    have been constantly interrupted by pre-season football and NBC 
    didn't even bother to tell anyone that both series could be seen 
    playing at their normal times on a little-known NBC cable station, so 
    if you missed an episode, you can always catch them streaming, on VOD

     my conundrum: People are getting fired or arrested for things they 
    say on Twitter and Facebook. While the majority of us don't agree 
    with a single word these dolts say, as long as they don't threaten 
    people's lives, what's the harm? One cop gets convicted (he may get a 
    life sentence) because he lived a fantasy life online about eating 
    people and talked to like-minded people about it. Disgusting? Sure it 
    is. Criminal? No way. We always believed that the &quot;Thought 
    Police&quot; was something of a <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/twitter altered logo small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Should This Be Twitter's New Logo?" BORDER="0">fantasy
     itself but, apparently, it's true. Since when did it become a crime 
    to express your opinion? Is it different doing it on a computer than 
    saying it to a person standing next to you? The New York Post seems 
    to be the major offender. They seem more interested in getting people 
    fired from their jobs for what they write on Twitter and Facebook 
    (They must have a full-time person who scans these accounts) than 
    actually reporting the news. Forget their prejudice against President 
    Obama (it's huge); they seem more interested in destroying people's 
    lives. People like you, me and your next door neighbor. I always 
    thought we had a right to say and believe anything we wanted to (as 
    long as we don't yell &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater), but 
    everything changed after 9-11. We now have the federal government 
    reading our mail, searching for keywords on Twitter and Facebook and 
    looking for photos that will incriminate a person. Listen, if you are 
    stupid enough to put up a photo of yourself holding an automatic 
    weapon while smoking a joint, you deserve everything that comes your 
    way, but if your avatar is a photo of Adolph Hitler and you say you 
    hate Jews, you could lose your job and also be put in jail. We may 
    not agree with what these idiots have to say, but they have the right 
    to say it as long as they don't threaten anyone's life. The Computer 
    Age has changed everything and none of those changes are positive for 
    you. At least according to the government. Watch what you say and do 
    on the Internet. Once it is on there, it can't be destroyed (even if 
    you erase it, because both Twitter and Facebook back up their sites 
    every night and keep the pages forever and so do most other social 
    networking sites), so don't say anything that will bite you on the 
    ass. Because people with nothing better to do will find it and make 
    your life miserable, just because they can. I speak from experience. 
    Even trying to find a job sometimes depends on your credit score and 
    what you say or post on your Facebook account. Remember when people 
    in power said that even the thought of this happening was a fantasy? 
    I wonder what these people think today? Law enforcement use the 
    internet daily to catch criminals (especially pedophiles) and that is 
    fine with me, but what other information are they collecting? A lot 
    of stuff written on the Internet can be taken out of context and the 
    progress of time may make those remarks seem more threatening than 
    they were when they were originally written. Be judicious when 
    writing anything on the Internet because (and I have taken a lot of 
    ribbing years ago for saying this): &quot;Once on the Internet, 
    always on the Internet.&quot; <B>UPDATE:</B> The newest line of 3-D 
    printers (costing anywhere from $3,000 and up, although prices are 
    falling) are now able to make guns out of plastic with 
    interchangeable barrels to fire any caliber of bullet (the cost of 
    the plastic is about $10.00). After about ten shots the barrel 
    becomes useless, but it can be easily changed. Not only are these 
    guns extremely dangerous, they are also practically undetectable at 
    airport screenings. One asshole company posted the blueprints for 
    such a gun on the Internet, but the bad press they received forced 
    them to pull it off the Internet, but not before the blueprints were 
    downloaded 900,000 times in less than 24 hours. If one of these guns 
    is responsible for one death, whether it be an American or anyone 
    else, the people who posted these blueprints should be thrown in 
    jail. I'm all for freedom of expression, but this is tantamount to 
    murder and the Second Amendment has nothing to do with it, no matter 
    what this company says (Of course, they are based in Texas!). I see 
    no point in working plastic guns except to bypass security and cause 
    mayhem. We thought the plastic gun John Malkovich carried in the film <B><A HREF="in_the_line_of_fire_1993.htm">IN

     thoughts on the 2013 - 2014 TV Season. All times listed are Eastern 
    Standard Time (EST): Well, the new Fall TV Season is upon us and here 
    are my thoughts on some new programs which should interest<A HREF="sleepy_hollow_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sleepy hollow series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    readers of this site. First up: FOX's <B><A HREF="sleepy_hollow_tv_series_2013.htm">SLEEPY
     HOLLOW</A></B> (Mondays 8:00 pm), a fun, visually inventive horror 
    series (on a limited 13 episode first season run) which turns 
    Washington Irving's tale on its head (pardon the pun). In this 
    retelling, Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) was a Revolutionary War soldier 
    working for General George Washington to fight the British. He 
    defeats a seemingly indestructable British soldier by cutting off his 
    head, but is mortally wounded in the battle. Somehow (it is only 
    hinted at in the pilot), Crane wakes up in modern-day Sleepy Hollow 
    (where he is a fish-out-of-water, marveling such things as cars, TV 
    and automatic weapons), just when the Headless Horseman comes back to 
    life (with his possessed red-eyed horse!) and kills the Sheriff 
    (Clancy Brown, in a 9-minute cameo, but there is always hope he will 
    return in flashback sequences [which, thankfully, he has]). Crane 
    joins forces with cop Abbie Mills (Nicole Beharie, <B>SPOILER!!!:</B> 
    She died on the final episode of Season 3) to uncover the secret of 
    the town and the Headless Horsman who, it turns out, is one of the 
    Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse. The pilot was full of inspirational 
    photography tricks, including an unusual way to depict the 
    decapitation of a parish priest. When the Headless Horseman picks up 
    a shotgun and automatic weapons and starts shooting up the town 
    (killing fellow cop John Cho; which seemed to be another extended 
    cameo, but further episodes reveal that he is actually undead), some 
    people may have rolled their eyes, but I found it a wild ride. One 
    funny scene finds Crane shooting a handgun at the Headless Horseman 
    and then throwing it to the ground after firing only one shot, 
    thinking that pistols are only capable of one discharge before 
    reloading! Here's to hoping that they can continue the lunacy of the 
    pilot, but only time will tell. The first episode did bring FOX their 
    highest ratings for a scripted TV series in seven years, but since it 
    started one week before all the other competing series would 
    premiere, let's reserve judgment until it has several episodes under 
    its belt. Any show that features <B><A HREF="fringe_tv_series_2008-2013.htm">FRINGE</A></B>'s
     (2008 - 2013) John Noble (who becomes a regular in Season 2) can't 
    be all that bad, can it? (<B>NOTE:</B> The show has been picked up 
    for a second &amp; third season and had one hell of a satisfying 
    season finale. The second season of <B><A HREF="following_tv_series_2013.htm">THE
     FOLLOWING</A></B> [already renewed for a third season, but FOX 
    announced on May 8, 2015 it would be the last since Season 3 was not 
    only low-rated, the plot was even more ridiculous than the first two 
    seasons, and that's quite a feat!] will now occupy the time slot.) <B>*</B> 
    Next: NBC's <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE BLACKLIST</A></B> 
    (Mondays 10:00 pm; the middle of Season 2 moved to Thursdays 9:00 
    pm), which I would have watched just for the fact that it starred 
    James Spader (who has packed on a few pounds and wears a convincing 
    prosthetic that looks like he shaved his head), but this is an 
    excellent action mystery unlike most procedurals on TV right now. 
    Spader stars as Raymond &quot;Red&quot; Reddington, a nattily dressed 
    master criminal who, for the past twenty years, has eluded all major 
    crime authorities and has been selling top secret information to the 
    highest bidders (for reasons as of yet unknown, since he disappeared 
    two decades ago, leaving his wife and children, without any advance 
    warning). That is, until one day he walks into FBI <A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blacklist season 1 tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="208" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>headquarters
     and voluntarily gives himself up. He offers to help capture the 
    world's most elusive criminals, but with one caveat: He will only 
    talk to and work with Agent Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Keen (Megan 
    Boone), who is beginning her job as a full-blown FBI agent at 
    Quantico on this very day. What is the connection between Liz and 
    Red? Liz was raised as an orphan and has a severe scar on&nbsp; her 
    right hand and wrist after her criminal father abused her her and 
    then died (which, somehow, Red knows about), but no connection 
    between her and Red can be found. In the first episode, Red helps Liz 
    solve the case of Serbian terrorist Ranko Zamani (Jamie Jackson), who 
    kidnaps an American General's young daughter and uses the little girl 
    as a human bomb; out to kill as many children as possible at a zoo 
    with a lethal chemical timebomb because his family was killed by an 
    American airstrike on his village during the Bosnian War. As the case 
    is solved, Liz also learns some disturbing news about her husband, 
    Tom (Ryan Eggold), thanks to clues given to her by Red. It is all the 
    more disturbing because, before the bomb is rendered harmless, Liz is 
    forced to witness her husband being stabbed two times by Zamani in 
    their own home and must make the choice of getting her husband to the 
    hospital or stopping Zamani from leaving the house. She chooses her 
    husband, who lies in a hospital bed on a respirator drifting between 
    life and death, and when she goes home to scrub the blood off their 
    rug, she discovers loose floorboards under the carpet, containing a 
    box with a small fortune in cash (in various foreign denominations) 
    and several passports of her husband under different names. What does 
    this all mean and will it affect them from adopting a baby girl (she 
    is either incapable of bearing children or her husband is shooting 
    blanks; it is not made clear in the pilot episode)? This was a fairly 
    absorbing 44 minutes of television and, since the pilot was directed 
    by Joe Carnahan (<B><A HREF="smokin_aces_2006.htm">SMOKIN' ACES</A></B> 
    - 2006; <B><A HREF="a_team_2010.htm">THE A-TEAM</A></B> - 2010), 
    there are some outstanding action set-pieces, including the tense 
    kidnapping of the young girl on a bridge. This was actually more like 
    watching a small movie than a TV show and I can't wait to see what 
    comes next. Spader is simply fantastic (when is he not?) and the 
    supporting cast, including Harry Lennix (<B><A HREF="man_of_steel_2013.htm">MAN
     OF STEEL</A></B> - 2013) and Diego Klattenhoff (Showtime's <B><A HREF="homeland_tv_series_2011.htm">HOMELAND</A></B>),
     do a great job. <B>UPDATE:</B> This is also the most DVRed new show 
    on television, with <B>AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D.</B> (see below) and <B>SLEEPY
     HOLLOW</B> (see above) not far behind. It has also been renewed for 
    a second season and rightfully so. <B>*</B> I wish I could say the 
    same thing about CBS's new series <B><A HREF="hostages_tv_series_2013.htm">HOSTAGES</A></B> 
    (which plays opposite of NBC's <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE
     BLACKLIST</A></B> on Mondays 10:00 pm), but this limited, 
    uninterrupted 15-episode series, executive produced by Jerry Bruckhe<A HREF="hostages_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hostages series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="198" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>imer,
     is about as common as they come, even though it contains some 
    excellent actors and some nice action sequences. The story is about 
    troubled FBI agent Duncan Carlisle (Dylan McDermott; <B><A HREF="wonderland_2003.htm">WONDERLAND</A></B> 
    - 2003), who is suffering from some devastating personal and 
    financial problems and takes the family of surgeon Dr. Ellen Sanders 
    (Toni Collette; <B><A HREF="fright_night_2011.htm">FRIGHT NIGHT</A></B> 
    - 2011) hostage with the help of some military buddies (including <B><A HREF="following_tv_series_2013.htm">THE
     FOLLOWING</A></B>&nbsp; and <B><A HREF="sons_of_anarchy_tv_series.htm">SONS
     OF ANARCHY</A></B>'s Billy Brown). Duncan wants Ellen to botch the 
    fairly routine operation she is soon to perform on the President of 
    the United States, Paul Kincaid (James Naughton; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Diary Of The Dead">DIARY
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 1976), and administer a deadly poison to him 
    (for reasons not yet made clear, but Duncan says he's doing &quot;bad 
    things for the right reasons&quot;), or he will kill her husband 
    (Tate Donovan), teenage son (Mateus Ward) and teenage daughter (Quinn 
    Shepard). Since this is a serialized thriller and we have wait to see 
    just what Ellen will do to postpone the operation, subplots abound, 
    including when we learn that her family have secrets of their own, 
    including her husband having an affair, her daughter is pregnant and 
    her son is involved in a drug deal. Duncan seems to know all the 
    family's secrets (How? That also is not made clear.) and has eyes 
    everywhere, so it will be extremely hard for Ellen and her family to 
    get away with anything, especially since Ellen is getting a lot of 
    press coverage for her upcoming operating on POTUS. While the premise 
    may sound intriguing, the writing never goes above average, which is 
    a shame, because actress Toni Collette deserves better. There are 
    some nice action sequences, including a tense bank robbery in the 
    beginning of the pilot, but the plot is about as cliched as they come 
    (flashbacks abound) and there are dead spots that lead to boredom. 
    Time will tell if this catches on with audiences, but I think it will 
    not do too well in the ratings. Who knows? I may be wrong. It won't 
    be the first time. (<B>Update:</B> It looks like <B>THE BLACKLIST</B> 
    kicked <B>HOSTAGES</B>' ass in the ratings for the first week [Not 
    counting DVR, On-Demand or streaming viewing]. Either CBS will have 
    faith with this timeslot, move it to another day or cancel it. We'll 
    see in the upcoming weeks, but they did repeat the series pilot on 
    the following Saturday, hoping it will attract more viewers).<B> NOTE:</B> 
    The series is now over and we will never hear from it again, except 
    for its eventual Blu-Ray/DVD release. CBS officially announced its 
    cancelation March 14, 2014. <B>*</B> I must say that I did enjoy the 
    premiere episode of ABC's <B><A HREF="agents_of_shield_tv_series_2013.htm">AGENTS
     OF S.H.I.E.L.D.</A></B> (Tuesdays 8:00 pm), Marvel's latest attempt 
    to conquer the filmic universe and a TV spin-off of their popular 
    theatrical release <B><A HREF="avengers_2012.htm">THE AVENGERS</A></B> 
    (2012), but I kept getting the feeling that this series was more 
    suited for The CW than ABC, thanks, in part, to the primary cast of 
    handsome and pretty young actors that populate this series. Don't get 
    me wrong, I absolutely love Clark Gregg and his portrayal of Agent 
    Phil Coulson (who also <A HREF="agents_of_shield_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/agents of s.h.i.e.l.d. series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="196" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>was

    and died in <B>THE AVENGERS</B>, but was brilliantly resurrected for 
    this series) and the action in the pilot was way above average 
    (thanks to direction by Joss Whedon), but since this is shown during 
    the &quot;family friendly&quot; hour of 8:00 PM, the violence level 
    is kept to a TV-PG minimum. I felt that it was played a little too 
    safe and could use some more more maturity in the writing. I know 
    Marvel has an image to uphold, where they make films and TV series 
    fit for teenagers and younger kids (with the exception of the <B><A HREF="blade_trio_1998-2004.htm">BLADE</A></B> 
    trio of films [1998 - 2004] and <B><A HREF="punisher_war_zone_2008.htm">THE
     PUNISHER: WAR ZONE</A></B> [2008; Marvel's name is nowhere to be 
    found in the opening or closing credits of the film!]), but this 
    series could use a little more of an adult touch if it wants to reach 
    more than teens and Marvel fanboys. I certainly didn't hate the pilot 
    (there were a few fun visual Easter Eggs for fans of the Marvel 
    Universe), even though most of the characters were underwritten and 
    the plot seemed somewhat rushed in the 44 minutes of air time (but 
    since this is a weekly TV series, it leaves plenty of room for 
    characters to be fleshed-out and, hopefully, plots that will be given 
    time to develop), but I need more than what the pilot offered if they 
    want me to watch this on a weekly basis. I know this will probably 
    get some fantastic ratings and will most likely have a long and 
    healthy lifespan, but it was missing that certain 
    &quot;something&quot; that keeps me coming back for more. (<B>Update:</B> <B>S.H.I.E.L.D.</B>

    viewers from the premiere episode, down to 8.4 million viewers, but 
    has held steady since. ABC has ordered a full season of scripts, but 
    has yet to announce whether it would be renewed for a second season, 
    but at this point, it is way too early to tell. Stan Lee puts in his 
    patented cameo in the February 4, 2014 episode.). To add insult to 
    injury, they have tied a recent episode to the newest <B><A HREF="thor_the_dark_world_2013.htm">THOR:

    episode of FOX's <B><A HREF="brooklyn_nine_nine_tv_series_2013.htm">BROOKLYN
     NINE-NINE</A></B> (Tuesdays at 8:30 pm and the Second Season Sundays 
    at 8:30 pm) because it features Andre Braugher and Terry Crews as 
    co-stars. The star of this police comedy series is former SNL star 
    Andy Samberg, so the success of this show hinges on whether enough 
    people like him or not. Personally, I think he is an overrated talent 
    and I find this series (Which some critics compare to <B><A HREF="barney_miller_tv_series_1974-1982.htm">BARNEY
     MILLER</A></B> [1974 - 1982]. Did they even watch this?) only 
    occasionally funny and none of it has to do with Samberg. Both 
    Braugher and Crews show a deft hand at comedy (But why did they have 
    to make Braugher gay? Does there have to be a gay person in every 
    sitcom?), but I bet that this series will only survive one season 
    because of the competition up against it, which includes the 
    previously-mentioned <B>NCIS</B>, <B>THE VOICE</B> and <B>AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D.</B>.
     While the first episode opened with respectable ratings numbers 
    (mainly due to<A HREF="american_horror_story_coven_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american horror story coven season 3 premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="217" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    the fact that it premiered one week before all the other networks 
    started their new season), the second episode lost nearly half its 
    viewers. Definitely not a good sign. Look for FOX to change days and 
    time slots for this series very soon if they hope for it to survive 
    even one season. (<B>NOTE:</B> FOX will be doing just that after the 
    Super Bowl, in which the show will be in the coveted spot after the 
    game is over. Sandberg's show will end in March after being moved to 
    an hour later. <B>NOTE #2:</B> In what seems like an alternate 
    universe, the Golden Globes has given Andy Samberg the award for Best 
    Actor in a Comedy Series and <B>BROOKLYN NINE-NINE</B> Best Comedy 
    Series. Either I'm dreaming or our world has become a much stupider 
    place. The Foreign Press, which compromise the Golden Globes, must be 
    on a drinking binge. FOX will now feel compelled to give it a second 
    season even if the ratings are no better than any show on the CW.) <B>*</B>

    simple fact that they just don't interest me: The CW's <B><A HREF="originals_tv_series_2013.htm">THE

    actually improve its ratings to the Tuesday move); <B><A HREF="tomorrow_people_tv_series_2013.htm">THE
     TOMORROW PEOPLE</A></B> (Wednesdays 9:00 pm), another fantasy from

    after a day of high school is watching another history lesson (<B>NOTE:</B>

    the same daughters, who always die at young ages in unusual ways) and 
    one who is like a cat and only has nine lives (in the pilot, she 
    already loses one). In the first place, since it airs on Lifetime, no

    will also bring back a character from the first season. It looks like 
    this is going to be off the hook. NOTE: It was already renewed for a 
    fifth season.). I enjoyed binge-viewing the first two seasons of this 
    weirdly violent and inventively visual series that way, so I'm not 
    going to do it any different this time. The hardest part is trying 
    not to read any spoilers before it reaches Blu-Ray (Especially when <A HREF="http://ew.com">Entertainment

    Movie.). <B>*</B> NBC's <B><A HREF="ironside_tv_series_2013.htm">IRONSIDE</A></B> 
    (Wednesdays 10:00 pm) is an updating of the old <B><A HREF="ironside_tv_series_1967-1975.htm">IRONSIDE</A></B> 
    (1967 - 1975) TV series and you couldn't ask for a more vanilla show, 
    even though Ironside is now played by a black man (remember that 
    disasterous 2005 TV series where Ving Rhames played <B><A HREF="kojak_tv_series_2005.htm">KOJAK</A></B>?).
     In the original series, Robert Ironside (Raymond Burr) was a cop who 
    was permanently put in a wheelchair by an assassin's bullet to his 
    spine yet, with the help of a crew of racially-diverse crackerjack detectives<A HREF="ironside_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ironside 2013 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    and helpers, solved eight season's worth of murders and other crimes 
    in San Francisco. In the new reboot, Robert Ironside (Blair 
    Underwood) is a cop who is put permanently in a wheelchair due to 
    being accidentally (?) shot by his own partner (Brent Sexton) in New 
    York City. Ironside hand-picks a crew of racially-diverse crackerjack 
    detectives and other people to help him solve crimes. Not much of a 
    difference between the two series, right? Wrong. In this incarnation, 
    Ironside is buff, works out, has sex with his girlfriend and is 
    extremely violent with perps, something which the original series was 
    not (and, really, who wanted to watch Raymond Burr get it on with any 
    woman?). Since this is shown during the 10:00 pm hour, the violence 
    level and language is amped-up from most network cop shows, but 
    viewers don't keep watching for the violence and a few 
    &quot;bullshits&quot; being spoken. They watch because of the 
    storyline. And in this case (at least based on the pilot), there is 
    too much going on to keep track of (including Ironside's life before 
    he became paralyzed and Sexton's constant beating himself up for 
    crippling his partner [by turning into a whiny alcoholic] and it gets 
    to be a bit too confusing to keep track of. They crammed way too much 
    into 44 minutes to make us really care much about any character. You 
    would also think that in today's society, they could have found a 
    real paraplegic actor to play Ironside instead of a well-known 
    thespian pretending to be one (the &quot;before&quot; scenes could 
    have easily been done with CGI). It would have added a needed bit of 
    realism to the series, since everyone knows Underwood from his many 
    TV and movie appearances, including a recurring role on the 
    long-running TV series <B><A HREF="la_law.htm">L.A. LAW</A></B> (1986 
    - 1994) and a starring role in the failed TV series <B><A HREF="event_tv_series_2010-2011.htm">THE
     EVENT</A></B> (2010 - 2011). As it stands, this series offers 
    nothing new to a well-worn genre, which is a shame, because a little 
    more thought&nbsp; and realistic casting could have made this reboot 
    something a little different on a Wednesday night. <B>IRONSIDE</B> 
    doesn't have a leg to stand on. I'll stick with Ted Danson and <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI:</A></B> (<B>Update:</B> 
    Looks like I was right in sticking with <B>CSI:</B>, because <B>IRONSIDE</B> 
    opened as the lowest-rated fall drama premiere ever in NBC's history 
    and was canceled after showing only two episodes, while <B>CSI:</B> 
    was renewed for a 15th Season!.). <B>*</B> I got an early look at the 
    pilot episode of NBC's <B><A HREF="dracula_tv_series_2013.htm">DRACULA</A></B> 
    (Fridays 10:00pm) and I am glad to report that it is one of the best 
    new network shows of the season. The only thing I worry about is the 
    day it is shown and the timeslot, a slot that has been dominated by 
    CBS' <B><A HREF="blue_bloods_tv_series_2010.htm">BLUE BLOODS</A></B> 
    for the past four years. NBC hopes to make Friday night a 
    supernatural night, since the new show follows <B><A HREF="grimm_tv_series_2011.htm">GRIMM</A></B> 
    (a show I have watched several times, but was not able to get 
    attached to), which is opposite of CBS' popular revival of <B><A HREF="hawaii_five_0_new_tv_series.htm">HAWAII
     FIVE-O</A></B>, so people have to decide whether they would rather 
    watch monsters or crime and crime usually wins every time (The last 
    time supernatural shows survive<A HREF="dracula_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dracula 2013 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>d
     on Friday nights were Chris Carter's <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
     X-FILES</A></B> [which was eventually moved to Sundays] and <B><A HREF="millennium_tv_series_1996-1999.htm">MILLENNIUM</A></B> 
    [that lasted for three seasons]). That would be a crying shame since 
    the new <B>DRACULA</B> is such a sumptuously-filmed and well-acted 
    series about the well-known bloodsucker (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) moving 
    to Victorian London pretending to be a rich American businessman. He 
    is there to get revenge on the people who turned him into a vampire 
    centuries ago under the guise of bringing modern science to the 
    country. He gets sidetracked, however, when beautiful woman Mina 
    Murray (Jessica De Gouw), turns out to be the spitting image of his 
    dead wife and Dracula thinks she could very well be her 
    reincarnation. The story may play fast and loose with Bram Stoker's 
    novel, but this is a very interesting take on the Dracula legend. 
    Just when you think the vampire genre is played to death, along comes 
    a show that proves you wrong. Like many cable series, this is only 
    slated to run for ten episodes for the first season, a tactic that 
    should be used for more network shows (<B><A HREF="hannibal_tv_series_2013.htm">HANNIBAL</A></B> 
    [now in its second season and renewed for a third, and final, season] 
    did it earlier in 2013 and the low-rated <B>HOSTAGES</B> is doing it 
    this Fall season, as is the sleeper hit <B>SLEEPY HOLLOW</B>), since 
    it keeps the writing fresh (with very little filler) and keeps the 
    action moving at a brisk pace. Even if you are a fan of Tom Selleck 
    and his series, you should DVR this new series and give it a chance 
    (the first two episodes got terrible ratings). Maybe NBC will trade 
    places with the now-canceled <B>IRONSIDE</B> and put this excellent 
    new series on at Wednesdays at 10:00pm. I would hate to see this 
    series fail and have NBC burn-off episodes on Saturday nights (like 
    they did with <B><A HREF="firm_tv_series_2012.htm">THE FIRM</A></B> 
    in 2012 and the Jekyll/Hyde medical series <B><A HREF="do_no_harm_tv_series_2012-2013.htm">DO
     NO HARM</A></B> - 2013; which actually turned into an involving 
    series that had me hooked on Saturday nights). Since Neilsen Ratings 
    now take DVR and time-shifting recordings into ratings numbers, do 
    yourself a favor and get involved with this excellent new series. 
    This is one is worth your time, even if it isn't at Fridays at 
    10:00pm. <B>NOTE:</B> The show aired all ten of its episodes on 
    Fridays, but I will be very surprised if it is renewed for a second 
    season. The ratings were anemic. That's not good for a show about a 
    master vampire. It was canceled on May 10, 2014. <B>*</B> Just to 
    proved that not everything that J.J. Abrams touches turns to gold, I 
    give you FOX's <B><A HREF="almost_human_tv_series_2013.htm">ALMOST HUMAN</A></B> 
    (Mondays 8:00 pm) and it is pretty bad and already done to death 
    (although not in this format) on TV since the mid-60's. The story is 
    simple: thirty-five years from now, a cop (played by Karl Urban, whom 
    I like a lot), just out of a coma, is partnered with an android 
    (Michael Ealy) to solve crimes. Both use their powers, Urban his 
    brain and gut and Ealy his human-like computer processor and unusual 
    strength, to solve crimes. While this is happening, Urban and Ealy, 
    who aren't the fondest of partners, become to respect each other for 
    what they do and figure out if they work together, they can be 
    unstoppable. You <A HREF="almost_human_tv_series_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/almost human series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="217" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>know,
     the same old shit. Since this was filmed on the <B><A HREF="fringe_tv_series_2008-2013.htm">FRINGE</A></B> 
    sets (hey why not recycle?) to save money since this is one of the 
    most expensive TV shows of the new season, a lot of the background 
    sets may look familiar to those who loved the latter series (me 
    included). The fact is that this new series reminded me of that Will 
    Smith flop <B><A HREF="i_robot_2004.htm">I, ROBOT</A></B> (2004) in 
    both looks and attitude and that just doesn't wash with me. Listen, 
    when the advertising materials on the series has a quote by <A HREF="http://ew.com">Entertainment
     Weekly</A> that states, &quot;A bromantic <A HREF="blade_runner_1982.htm"><B>BLADE
     RUNNER</B></A>.&quot;, all I wanted to do was cry. 
    &quot;Bromantic&quot;? Really? And then I got a sneak prevue of the 
    series and I wanted to cry some more. My advice to J.J. Abrams: I 
    know you are now a hot commodity, but slow down a little and let the 
    creativity flow. This is not the first show about a human/android 
    partnership. Remember Maxwell Smart &amp; Hymie on <B><A HREF="get_smart_tv_series_1965-1970.htm">GET
     SMART</A></B> (1965 - 1970)? How about <B><A HREF="holmes_and_yo_yo_tv_series_1976-1977.htm">HOLMES

    little movie and TV franchise called <B><A HREF="robocop_1987.htm">ROBOCOP</A></B>?
     There are too many more examples to mention. What I am basically 
    saying is that while the technology may have improved, the premise 
    has been around for many decades on TV and even longer in books. So 
    don't piss down my leg and tell me that it is raining. I will give 
    the show some time to develop, but I doubt the stories are going to 
    make me change my mind. The series also bumps one of FOX's best-known 
    series, <B><A HREF="bones_tv_series_2005.htm">BONES</A></B>, to a 
    death sentence in the Friday 8:00 pm&nbsp; time slot. Goodbye, <B>BONES</B>,
     it was nice knowing you. Nine years was a nice run (Although it is 
    getting good ratings for Friday airings. Now that is fan dedication! 
    It still got good enough ratings to merit a 10th Season! This is a 
    show that has had so many different days and time period shifts [now 
    it is on Mondays!], yet fans still stuck with it. I love being proved 
    wrong. Season 10, airing on Thursday September 25, 2014 [another new 
    time slot yet again!] opens with the shocking murder of Dr. Sweets 
    [John Francis Daley], which proves there is still life in the old 
    show yet!). Don't look for <B>ALMOST HUMAN</B> to achieve that 
    milestone. I'll give it a season or two at most and that's being 
    kind. I sometimes wonder who makes these decisions or is there some 
    type of spinning carnival-like wheel that tells these business suits 
    where to put their programs? FOX is losing viewers and it's 
    bone-headed moves like this that will make them even loose more. I 
    predict a few million viewers for the Sunday November 17, 2013 &amp; 
    Monday November 18, 2013 series premiere, but I wouldn't count on 
    viewers staying around to watch it week after week unless it changes 
    course really soon. <B>NOTE:</B> FOX canceled the series on April 29,

    period detail (especially the clothing) and language, borderline 
    nudity and violence which goes way beyond what basic cable usually 
    allows (which garnered it a TV-MA rating, unusual for a basic cable 
    program), the actual miniseries is nothing spectacular. As a matter 
    of fact, it really just drags along until its inevitable conclusion. 
    Filled with flashbacks during the mobsters and cops younger years, it 
    reminded me somewhat of what Sergio Leone's <B><A HREF="once_upon_a_time_in_america_1984.htm">ONCE

    better. While not a total failure by a long shot, one gets the 
    feeling that Frank Darabont made this rather quickly as a big 
    &quot;Fuck You&quot; to AMC for&nbsp; being uncerimoniously tossed 
    off <B>THE WALKING DEAD</B>'s set for reasons that are still unclear 
    (especially since it was Daramont's baby). What could have been a 
    landmark miniseries is nothing but an average period detective film 
    noir with a gallery of good actors and bloody violence. I'm sure a 
    lot more people will like it more than I do, but the same goes 
    towards my feelings towards <B>THE WALKING DEAD</B>, which I find 
    full of cliched characters, banal dialogue borderlining on religious 
    mumbo-jumbo and a required zombie attack during every episode. Some 
    people think all you need is bloody violence to make a good series. I 
    demand more than that. I demand believable characters that I can care 
    about and plots that are more than your basic scenarios that have 
    been done many times before. That describes what both of theses 
    series lack in spades (although watching Edward Burns getting shot to 
    pieces was a nice touch in an otherwise dreary series). Darabont 
    can't get thrown off this series (he still has a lawsuit over at AMC 
    over <B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE WALKING DEAD</A></B>)
     because it is already done and in the can, but maybe next time he 
    can do a series that contains real characters we can aspire to? (<B>NOTE:</B>

    asking yourself, &quot;Marg Helgenberger left <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI:
     CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION</A></B> for this?&quot; Helgenberger plays 
    Lillian Strand, Gabriel Vaughn's &quot;handler&quot;, and boy does 
    she have a lot on her hands. The first question that crossed my mind 
    when I watched the first episode (which will premiere on Tuesday 
    January 7, 2014 at 9:00pm, right after a new episode of <B><A HREF="ncis_tv_series.htm">NCIS</A></B>,
     just to make sure the new series gets the best audience numbers 
    possible since it follows the most successful scripted series on TV) 
    is why would they give a guy who likes to do things his way and hates 
    following orders the most advanced technology in the world? The 
    episodes I have seen so far (one of the perks of running a web site) 
    are nothing to write home about, but they are entertaining, if you 
    can get beyond some of the plots' most gaping holes. And there are 
    plenty, but I'll let you discover them since the first episode will 
    probably get great Neilsen ratings. It won't do too well in its 
    regular time slot because it runs opposite of the popular new series <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE
     BLACKLIST</A></B> (and rightfully so), since that show seems to be 
    getting better and better as it progresses. Still, the series does 
    have some positive points, such as Holloway's charm and natural 
    screen presence, some great action sequences and also a recurring 
    role by Lance Reddick of <B><A HREF="fringe_tv_series_2008-2013.htm">FRINGE</A></B> 
    (2008 - 2013). It may become popular on a different day or at a 
    different time, but I don't see this lasting beyond the first 13 
    episode order in its current time slot. I would like this series to 
    succeed, but I'm not in charge of TV programming. Some of their 
    choices are truly head-scratching, including this one, considering 
    all the talent in front of the camera. Maybe CBS will come to their 
    sense before it is too late for this series. (<B>NOTE:</B> The second 
    episode, shown in its regular time slot of Mondays 10:00pm drew in a 
    paltry 1.6 million viewers. CBS will have to do something quick to 
    save this series from oblivion. <B>NOTE #2:</B> The series will not 
    be renewed after all the current episodes are shown due to poor 
    ratings) <B>*</B> I don't want to know about HBO's new series <A HREF="true_detective_tv_series_2014.htm"><B>TRUE

    two different stars as partners to solve a crime for eight episodes. 
    On the freshman season. those two stars happen to be Woody Harrelson 
    and Matthew McConaughey. How could it not be great? These two stars 
    have had excellent career resurgences in the past several years and 
    whomever thought of putting them together should get an Emmy for<A HREF="true_detective_tv_series_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/true detective 2014 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    casting. I don't know anything about the plot (I refused the first 
    two episodes as screeners from HBO because I want to witness it with 
    the rest of the world.), but when you put these two actors together 
    you just know that fireworks are going to explode. And that, my 
    friend, is what TV is all about. If I am disappointed in this series, 
    I think I will shoot myself! (<B>NOTE:</B> The first episode was a 
    corker, telling the story in flashback fashion starting in 1995 
    investigating a heinous crime and then skipping to 2012 [but not 
    before experiencing important events that happen in 2002 later in the 
    series], with both detectives speaking to Internal Affairs seperately 
    [with McConaughey's character looking entirely different than the 
    flashback parts], which lets you know something extremely big 
    happened [the actual murder, about a dead and bound young woman with 
    antlers attached to her head, only took less than 5 minutes of screen 
    time, but it's a head-scratcher] and introducing us to the 
    fascinating characters. For once, Harrelson is the straight-laced 
    detective who is married with a family [but the marriage is far from 
    perfect; as a matter of fact, it is as far from perfect as you can 
    get] and McConaughey the troubled partner with a past that concerns a 
    deceased wife [who took her own life] and daughter who was killed by 
    a speeding car [The scene where McConaughey shows up drunk for his 
    first dinner at Harrelson's house is a masterpiece of acting and 
    doesn't end the way you think it would.]. The pilot episode left you 
    wanting to watch the whole eight episodes at once. An A+ all the 
    way!). I particularly like McConaughey's take on the beginning of 
    religion in the third episode: &quot;Been that way since one monkey 
    looked at the sun and said to the other monkey, 'He told me for you 
    to give me your fucking share.' People are so goddamn frail that they 
    rather put a coin in a wishing well than buy dinner.&quot; The 
    &quot;Mowing My Lawn&quot; sequence in the third episode is also a 
    thing of beauty that should be studied by aspiring actors everywhere. 
    The same episodes also informs us that McConaughey suffers from a 
    rare condition where he can taste colors! Another recent episode had 
    a six minute action scene shot in one interrupted take. You can't ask 
    for better than this. Now we just have to find out who the 
    &quot;Yellow King&quot; is (pay close attention to all the subtle 
    clues dropped in every episode)! And we wonder why pay cable series 
    shine when compared to their network counterparts. It's not the 
    nudity. It's not the foul language. It's because they tell better 
    stories and take chances just like I have just explained. Watch it 
    and be amazed just for the philosophical words that come out of 
    McConaughey's mouth thanks to writer/creator Nic Pizzolatto and 
    director Cary Fukunaga (All who did the entire eight episodes and 
    Cary was the only one in the entire series to win a 2014 Emmy 
    Award&reg; for directing the episode &quot;Who Goes There&quot;, the 
    one with the six minute uninterrupted take, but a big &quot;BOO!&quot;
     for not giving Matthew McConaughey the Emmy&reg; for Best Actor. If 
    this wasn't Bryan Cranston's final year on <B><A HREF="breaking_bad_tv_series_2008.htm">BREAKING

    thanks to NBC screeners and it is a well-written show with a lot of 
    action and some great character actors as stars (Jason Beghe, John 
    Seda, Sophia Bush, Mykelti Williamson, Patrick John Flueger, Elias 
    Koteas and J.B. Smoove), but it would get much better numbers in an 
    earlier time spot opposite something a little less popular, but since <B>CHICAGO

    NBC for giving us more scripted TV than reality TV as of late and I 
    hope this series picks up the same numbers as its companion series. 
    This way the Chicago heritage can live on for a full season without

    FOX's <B><A HREF="rake_tv_series_2014.htm">RAKE</A></B> (Thursdays

    thirteen-episode series based on an <A HREF="rake_australian_tv_series_2010.htm">Australian
     show of the same name</A>) and it's no coincidence that the 
    advertising materials are comparing it to <B><A HREF="house_md_tv.htm">HOUSE
     M.D.</A></B> (2004 - 2012), but instead of having Hugh Laurie in his 
    ascerbic performance as Dr. House, we have devil-may-care criminal 
    defense attorney Keegan Deane (the wonderful Greg Kinnear). Besides 
    being a lawyer, Keegan is also a compulsive gambler (who gets beaten 
    up for not paying his debts, even though he has a friendly rapport 
    with the gambling enforcer, played by Omar Dorsey) and a womanizer 
    whose biggest problem is his mouth. He just doesn't know when to keep 
    it shut, whether he is in court or out of it (that also gets him 
    beaten up a lot). Kinnear is pitch perfect as the lawyer with a big 
    mouth who says out loud what we usually only think. Don't get me 
    wrong, this is just another procedural show, but this show gives that 
    genre a needed shot in the arm thanks to Kinnear's grand performance 
    and some of the things he says are so funny, I nearly pissed my 
    pants. There are a few problems with the show, like Deane's current 
    wife Scarlet (Necar Zadegan) being the opposing counsel in many of 
    his cases (she knows he's a womanizing prick and the first time we 
    see Deane, he is drunk with a prostitute on his arm!) and some of the 
    cases are only so-so (the pilot has a serial killer, played by the 
    brilliant Peter Stormare, trying to recant his confession), but since 
    the pilot was directed by none other than Sam Raimi, it all seems to 
    go down like a spoonful of sugar. I'll leave it to you, my dear 
    readers, to discover this show, because it deserves a long life just 
    like <B>HOUSE M.D.</B> did. The fact that Deane learns absolutely no 
    lessons from his verbal and physical miscues on the show is one of 
    its strongest points. This is one show that should not have a short 
    life span, so watch or DVR it when it is on! Put this show on your 
    viewing schedule. Watch all of the thirteen episodes so it will 
    return again in the fall. <B>NOTE:</B> After a short move to Fridays,

     X-FILES</A></B>, except that you can't go into the middle of this 
    show without being confused, because it plays like a continuous arc 
    soap opera rather than a single-story-per-episode series. The premise 
    is this: CDC scientist Dr. Alan Farragut is called to a secret lab 
    located in the middle of the Artic to check out that the possibility 
    of a new strain of mutagen has been unleashed. Unfortunately, Alans's 
    brother, Dr. Peter Farragut (Neil Napier), is the first to be 
    infected and he gains superhuman strength and infects other members 
    of the staff by kissing them and oozing a black substance in their 
    mouths (remind anyone of anything?). Since they can't catch Peter, 
    Alan wants to inform the CDC, but his orders are blocked by the lab's 
    mysterious boss, Dr. Hiroshi Hatake (Hiroyuki Sanada), who may or may 
    not know just what this mutagen is and does. All manner of 
    transportation has been destroyed, as well as every manner of 
    communication, so Alan and the surviving staff must quarantine the 
    infected and catch Peter before he does more harm, Just what this 
    mutagen does (Is it alien or man-made?) will be answered as the show 
    progresses (there is a nice shot of hundreds of frozen monkeys 
    standing in a row outside in the freezing snow, after one of the 
    visiting female scientists, played by Catherine Lemieux, is told by 
    one of the lab's lackeys that no monkeys were ever at the lab), but I 
    lost interest after three episodes and will probably not return to 
    it. The episodes compromised endless scenes of people crawling 
    through heating ducts looking for Peter (and with absolutely no idea 
    how to stop him if they found him, which is proven in at least one 
    instance). It is just too familiar to the many infectious disease 
    movies and TV shows I have seen in my lifetime. It's also obvious 
    that this was made in Canada because some of the actors don't even 
    try to disguise their accents. I do love the ad for the show, though 
    (see above right). (<B>NOTE:</B> SyFy has ordered a second season of

    reboot, or whatever you want to call it, will be shown at 9:00pm. Not 
    a shock, but still a surprise that the show was getting really poor 
    ratings. <B>NOTE #2:</B> A&amp;E gave the show to their sibling 
    network LMN (formerly Lifetime Movie Network) to burn off the final 8

    motivation and manipulation. Liking the show depends on your 
    tolerance for Steve Zahn (who nearly ruined the first season of HBO <B><A HREF="treme_hbo_series.htm">TREME</A></B>&nbsp;
     - 2010-2013, before toning it down) as Clark Edwards, a genius in 
    human psychology who also happens to be bipolar (which lets him go 
    off the edge and act like some crazy idiot savant every now and then) 
    and his ex-con brother Ross Edwards, played by DTV king Christian 
    Slater. They, along with some of Clark's students, solve clients 
    problems using their minds and manipulation rather than violence. The 
    ending of the pilot episode left me slackjawed and made me wonder how 
    they were going to fix things (I'll leave it for you to discover, 
    unless ABC changes the ending when it originally airs February 25, 
    2014). Since I was only given the pilot before actual showtime (it 
    was moved up from March 11, 2014 due to the dismal ratings of <B><A HREF="killer_women_tv_series_2014.htm">KILLER
     WOMEN</A></B>), I, along with you, will have to see if they can fix 
    it. Until then we'll just have to wait. Since TNT has the 
    similarly-themed show <B><A HREF="perception_tv_series_2012.htm">PERCEPTION</A></B> 
    (2012 - 2015), starring Eric McCormack as the crazy professor who 
    uses deduction and manipulation to solve crimes (and talks to 
    imaginary people who help him solve those crimes, basically a 
    metaphor for him being able to say he solved the crimes not using his 
    own brain), the success of this show depends on whether you can 
    accept two similar shows (on the same day and time, no less!) dealing 
    with the same subject. My guess is that this series will run this 10 
    episode season and then will disappear. Steve Zahn just rubs me the 
    wrong way and if he does that to me, he will do that to a lot of 
    other people. (And a lot of people who are really afflicted with the 
    biploar disease Zahn has on the show are voicing the way Zahn 
    portrays it comedically, especially when he goes off his meds.). At 
    least Christian Slater can fall back on DTV films. <B>NOTE:</B> Guess 
    I was right. On March 27, 2014, after airing 5 episodes, ABC pulled <B>MIND
     GAMES</B> from the schedule&nbsp; due to poor ratings and replaced 
    it with a reality show called <B>CELEBRITY WIFE SWAP</B> (now in its 
    second season), to be shown after airing a couple of encores of <B>RESURRECTION</B> 
    (see next). <B>*</B> ABC's <B><A HREF="resurrection_tv_series_2014.htm">RESURRECTION</A></B>

    always good Kurtwood Smith and Francis Fisher play Henry and Lucille 
    Langston, who one day are <A HREF="resurrection_tv_series_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/resurrection 2014 series premiere tv ad3 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="520" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>delivered
     their young son Jacob (Landon Gimenez; who wakes up in a rice paddy 
    in China) by Immigration agent J. Martin Bellamy (Omar Epps) to their 
    farmhouse in the sleepy little town of Arcadia, Missouri. The problem 
    is, Jacob died over 30 years ago and hasn't aged a day. Soon other 
    dead people begin turning up in the town, but these people are not 
    zombies or the living dead. They have all the qualities of a normal 
    human being. Based on the novel &quot;The Returned&quot; by Jason 
    Mott, this series sets off to tell how families deal with the people 
    they thought were dead brought back into their lives, rather than 
    trying to find out why it happened (I guess if we find out why, the 
    series would be over). I like a good mystery just like the next guy, 
    but this is a more personal tale about how families, especially Henry 
    and Lucille, deal with a young son at their advanced age and 
    wondering if it is their son at all (DNA evidence seems to prove that 
    it is.). Series like this don't seem to last too long nowadays 
    because serialized dramas (with a touch of science fiction) don't 
    seem to flourish during the regular TV season. They seem to do much 
    better as a Summer series (Take a look at the success of <B><A HREF="under_the_dome_tv_series_2013.htm">UNDER
     THE DOME</A></B>.). Of the first three episodes I have seen (thanks 
    to screeners provided by ABC), I can say with a clear conscience that 
    this is a well-acted show (Matt Craven plays Sheriff Fred Langston, 
    who also happens to be Henry's brother and whose wife drowned trying 
    to save Jacob 30 years earlier), but it needs more information on why 
    the dead are returning back to life and only in the town of Arcadia. 
    There is a subplot where Fred's daughter Gail (Devin Kelly) believes 
    that Jacob knows more than he is saying (which is true), but giving 
    the viewers morsels during each episode will not sustain an audience, 
    at least not during a time when new series and old favorites jam-up 
    Sunday nights. If you ask me, they should have waited until the 
    Summer to air this series, because it doesn't stand much of a chance 
    during it's current day and time period. It may have been a hit 
    during the Summer, but as it stands now, I don't see it lasting more 
    than it's limited 8-episode run. And that's a shame. <B>UPDATE:</B> 
    Seems like I was wrong. <B>RESURRECTION</B> opened to very strong 
    numbers and factoring in DVR recordings, surpassed the numbers <B>THE BLACKLIST</B> 
    (see above) are getting. It looks like a lock for renewal.<B> NOTE:</B> 
    It was renewed for a second season (starting Sunday September 28, 
    2014 at 9:00pm), but many people and critics complained that the 
    season-ending episode was a real letdown that they will probaby pass 
    on the second season. No questions were answered and it turned more 
    into a soap opera than a supernatural series. It really disappointed 
    the loyal viewers by asking more questions and giving no answers. It 
    may have worked on <B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B>

    episodes on Netflix. The A&amp;E Network is reportedly remaking the 
    French series. The big question here is: Why? Do we really need two

    zombies, but as they were when they originally passed away?</FONT></FONT></P>

     murdered in an automobile &quot;accident&quot;, a group known as the 
    &quot;True Believers&quot; who have been protecting the little girl 
    for her entire life decide the best person to protect her is Tate 
    (Jake McLaughlin). The only problem is that Tate is on Death Row (and 
    says he is innocent) and about to be executed, so True Believer 
    member Winter (Delroy Lindo, dressed as a prison priest) breaks Tate 
    out of prison, attaches an unremovable tracking device to him and 
    teams her up with Bo, who is in the hospital recovering from the 
    automobile &quot;accident&quot; (She makes an MRI machine go haywire 
    when the attendants refuse to turn it off.). Now they are both

    unknown and sends female assassin Leeds (Katie McClellan) to do the 
    deed, but Bo manages to save the day time and time again. Bo and Tate 
    have a connection which will be revealed at the end of Episode 1, so 
    it should make for interesting viewing (the secret is not hard to 
    figure out after watching the entire first episode, the only screener 
    supplied to me). There's also a small subplot about a young doctor 
    and his dying father that is very touching and is resolved by the end 
    of the episode. This series stands a chance of becoming a cult hit as 
    long as it is given the right time slot (It is certainly crowded on

    (2013), who directed and co-wrote the pilot, the series stands a 
    chance of becoming a midseason hit if given the time to mature. NBC 
    really has nothing to lose since they only have three or four of 
    their shows that regularly make it into the top 25 TV shows of the 
    week (now that football and the Olympics are off the air), so giving 
    this limited 9-episode series a chance to flourish could only be in 
    their best interest. The series is well-shot and acted and deserves a 
    chance to prove itself. Let's hope that NBC has the guts to give this 
    series a chance to catch on. Of course, NBC (or rather Comcast), in

    (actually filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada) and contains the funny 
    accents, has nothing to do with the film. This is an extremely black 
    comedy 10-episode self-contained series that is adult in nature (and, 
    according to the creators, takes place one day after the events of 
    the original film), about a lurid stranger named Lorne Malvo (an Emmy 
    Award&reg;-winning performance by Billy Bob Thornton) who arrives in 
    a small Minnesota town and begins having bad effects on people, 
    especially insurance salesman Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman), which 
    leads to murder, kidnapping, blackmail and lots of violence and 
    humor. I have seen the first three episodes thanks to screeners and I 
    will officially put this on my DVR since it runs opposite <B><A HREF="person_of_interest_tv_series_2011.htm">PERSON

    promised that this series is self-contained and won't have the story 
    continued next year, I think if this series is successful (and it 
    should be), it will take the route of HBO's <B><A HREF="true_detective_tv_series_2014.htm">TRUE

    season, with new actors or some returning ones. This is one of the 
    better new series of the &quot;second season&quot;, so give it a try 
    and you will probably find yourself hooked on the very first episode.

    has turned into nothing into a pale imitation of the movie it is 
    based on. But things took a drastic turn in later episodes and the

    While the series is nothing to write home about, it is still one of 
    the most violent shows on TV right now, filled with hangings, graphic 
    burnings, brandings, crushings, thumb screws, the Pear of Anguish (if

    devices and ways used to get normal, everyday people to confess they

    stomach-turning violence. That is, if they get the channel at all. My 
    cable company does not carry it (my review is based on screeners), so 
    my only hope of watching it is if it is on VOD on my Roku 3 streaming 
    player. If I can't get it there, I will have to wait for the eventual 
    Blu-Ray/DVD release. I give the series points for pushing the 
    boundaries of what is acceptable violence on a non-pay cable channel 
    (Most of the episodes are Rated TV-MA), but since this series has 
    been in the planning stages since 2012, the story line could have 
    been much, much better (One Puritan actually says , &quot;I call 
    bullshit!&quot;). Proceed at your own risk, but the violence here 
    makes that in <B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE WALKING DEAD</A></B>

    been renewed for a second season, with the beautiful Lucy Lawless

     10:00pm) is a limited series mash-up of all horror icons of 19th 
    Century 1891 Victorian London, including Dr. Frankenstein (Harry 
    Treadaway), his Monster (Rory Kinnear), Dorian Gray (Reeve Carney), 
    characters from the Dracula novel like Mina Harker (Olivia Llewellyn; 
    but not Dracula himself, at least not yet) and stars Timothy Dalton, 
    Josh Hartnett and Eva Green as original characters in this gothic 
    melodrama with plenty of bloody violence (the first scene opens with 
    the dismemberment murders of a young girl and her pregnant mother). 
    The real-life literature written during this period will blow your 
    mind, including Stevenson's<I> THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE</I> 
    and Welles' <I>WAR OF THE WORLDS</I> and <I>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</I> 
    are just a few examples. At first the storyline to this series is 
    confusing and illogical, but it soon calms down and becomes a scary, 
    gory ride where people don't always seem who they say they are. There 
    are a lot of strange visuals on view and some nice art direction, but 
    since Showtime was stingy and only sent me the screener of the first 
    episode, I will have to watch the rest of the 10-episode season with 
    you. The first episode sets up fish-out-of water American 
    sharpshooter Ethan Chandler (Hartnett) arrival in London in a Wild 
    West show and the way it affects African explorer Sir Malcolm Murray 
    (Dalton) and spiritualist Vanessa Ives (Green) and all the other 
    characters. Sir Malcolm needs Ethan's skills to help him find his 
    missing daughter and soon Dr. Frankenstein and his Monster join in 
    the search. Has Jack The Ripper returned after a three year absence? 
    Since I love gothic melodramas and it looks like <B><A HREF="mentalist_tv_series.htm">THE
     MENTALIST</A></B> is not going to be renewed (Nope, It was renewed 
    on August 10, 2014 for a final 7th Season. Yea!), this looks like my 
    go-to show on Sundays at 10:00pm for 8 weeks. I'm afraid I can't tell 
    you more because I'm just in the dark as you are, but this looks like 
    it could be a mind-bending series that mixes fictional literary 
    characters with new ones (I can tell you that Ethan and Dorian Gray 
    have sex!). Only time will tell, but since Showtime no longer has <A HREF="dexter_tv_series.htm"><B>DEXTER</B></A>,

     with a third season to follow in 2015.) that will either make 
    Showtime a name to contend with or sink them like the Titanic. My 
    vote if for the former. <B>NOTE:</B> The series has already been 
    renewed for a second season. One June 16, 2015 it was renewed for a 
    third season.<B> NOTE #2:</B> It seemed like the third season was the 
    last, which took everyone by surprise (including myself) when they 
    killed Eva Green's character in the final episode of the season and 
    an end title card stating simply &quot;THE END&quot; was shown on 
    screen. It caused a firestorm on the internet, but I found it to be 
    the perfect ending for a series dripping heavy in gothic atmosphere. 
    The fact that Showtime was able to keep the end of the series a 
    secret is one of the most amazing parts. <B>*</B> <B><A HREF="crossbones_tv_series_2014.htm">CROSSBONES</A></B> 
    (Fridays 10:00pm) is the second pirate series of 2014 (Starz's <B><A HREF="black_sails_tv_series_2014.htm">BLACK
     SAILS</A></B> was the first and was renewed for a third season on 
    October 12, 2014 and then for a fourth season on July 31, 2015 before 
    the third season even started.) and it is the third series on NBC to 
    be shown in that time slot (the canceled <B><A HREF="dracula_tv_series_2013.htm">DRACULA</A></B> 
    and the renewed <B><A HREF="hannibal_tv_series_2013.htm">HANNIBAL</A></B>,
     which had one hell of a season-ender, were the other two) and it is 
    also by far the weakest. The always enjoyable John Malkovich portrays 
    Edward, a.k.a. Blackbeard the Pirate (although Molkovich only sports 
    a small grey beard) and his band of mateys are infiltrated by Tom 
    Lowe (Richard Coyle), the pirate-day version of James Bond, as he 
    tries to destroy Blackbeard's business and catch him in the act of 
    piracy, so everyone can see him hanging at the end of a rope. This 
    once 10-episode series, cut down to 9 episodes, is pretty to look at 
    (although some of the CGI is dodgy), but it is apparent that 
    Malkovich is just slumming here and just having fun when he should be 
    acting a litle more serious. The storyline is uninvolving and it 
    looks like NBC doesn't have much faith it it, so don't look for it to 
    get a renewal next season unless a miracle happens and it becomes a 
    cult series (but I doubt that very much because it plays fast and 
    loose with the time period it supposedly takes place in). As eye 
    candy, the series is a dandy, but as a drama, best to go visit your 
    mama. Hey, that rhymes! I'm not going to stick around to watch any 
    more episodes and I am sure that I am not the only one. Hiring 
    Malkovich to do a series was a genius idea, but to put him in 
    something this ordinary and unimaginative was a bullshit idea. He 
    could have been put into something much better than this, like James 
    Spader was put on <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE BLACKLIST</A></B>.

    will be missed for your many conspiracy theories (a true-life Belzer 
    trait, too), your sarcastic humor (especially about your many 
    marriages and divorces), your black suit with dark sunglasses and 
    fedora, some standout episodes of <B>SVU</B> and your longevity in a

    people (myself included) complained about your lack of substantial 
    screen time in some of the episodes during the middle of the first 
    decade of the New Millennium, you always handled yourself with grace 
    and dignity. Although you rarely got an episode devoted solely to 
    your character, when you did, they were some of the most memorial 
    episodes of the series (The fifth season assisted-suicide episode 
    titled &quot;Painless&quot;, with guest star Marlee Matlin, was one 
    of the best Munch-centric shows of the series, as was the eighth 
    season episode titled &quot;Uncle&quot;, where Jerry Lewis portrayed

    unstable uncle.), Here's to bigger and better things Richard Belzer! 
    I hope we don't see the last of Detective John Munch. Thank you for 
    over 20 years of entertaining television! <B>NOTE:</B> He pays Olivia 
    Benson (Mariska Hargitay) a visit on the final episode of the 15th 
    Season, so Retired Detective Munch is still around! And while we are 
    at it, let's bid a fond farewell to Dann Florek, who played Captain 
    Donald Cragen on both <B>LAW &amp; ORDER</B> (from 1990 to 1994) and 
    then on <B>LAW &amp; ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT</B> (from 1999 to 
    2014; both from their pilot episodes). He was written out of the 15th 
    season of <B>SVU</B> shortly after Belzer left the series due to him 
    reaching mandatory retirement age of 63 in the police force (Florek 
    is actually 64) and was replaced by Donal Logue as Lieutenant Declan 
    Murphy after Mariska Hargitay had a short-lived command of the squad. 
    Florek appeared in over 400 episodes of both series. He will also be 
    missed. But the series has survived more than a handful of major cast 
    changes and still goes strong. Only Hargitay is now an original 
    member of the series. And why does she get more beautiful as every 
    season debuts? Could it be because she inherited some great genes 
    (from Jayne Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay, who are both no longer 
    with us.)? As long as she is on the show, it will survive.</FONT></FONT></P>

    and put out films that they ask for. Even if you don't agree with

     along with three other movies listed above (I'll leave it for you to 
    find out which ones). <B>NOTE:</B> William Olsen has been acting 
    somewhat strange as of late (a lot of people would say, &quot;So 
    what? That's the way he usually acts.&quot;), but he has been acting 
    a lot more stranger than usual and not releasing his films on the 
    schedule he promised and has quit shipping overseas himself and has 
    not supplied Diabolik with the discs he has promised overseas buyers 
    (if he did, they all sold out in record time, which I highly doubt). 
    Don May Jr., who runs Synapse Films, has offered to buy out Code Red, 
    so we will have to see how this plays out, but since they are bitter 
    enemies (the least said about the incident, the better), we will see 
    how this plays out. Strange times indeed. <B>UPDATE #3:</B> September 
    20, 2014: After a long drought, Bill just announced the pre-booking 
    of four Blu-Rays in a bundle: <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Messiah Of Evil">MESSIAH
     OF EVIL</A></B> (previously available on DVD), <B><A HREF="revenge_of_the_cheerleaders_1976_blu-ray.htm">REVENGE
     OF THE CHEERLEADERS</A></B>, <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BrotherhoodOfDeath">BROTHERHOOD
     OF DEATH</A></B> and <B><A HREF="lady_stay_dead_1981_blu-ray.htm">LADY,
     STAY DEAD</A></B> for release sometime in mid-October 2014 (which I 
    did buy). In less than a day, he no longer offered them as a 
    four-pack bundle for $79.99, instead offering them as single discs 
    only, stating that too many overseas customers were complaining. 
    Since he no longer ships overseas himself and seems to have found 
    some type of twisted logic in his mind (he has always shipped discs 
    overseas, whether he was supposed to or not), he says that he is only 
    allowed to ship the Blu-Ray <B>MESSIAH OF EVIL</B> overseas and not 
    the other three films. If Bill keeps up this behavior, there will be 
    no Code Red in the near future. Let's see if he supplies Diabolik 
    with enough copies of <B>MESSIAH OF EVIL</B> to satisfy overseas 
    customers. Meanwhile, overseas customers have to rely on American 
    friends to purchase the DVDs and Blu-Rays for them and then ship them 
    to their foreign addresses. Since overseas customers amount to almost 
    40% of Code Red's customers, there seems to be a lot going wrong here 
    and it is the customers who are suffering. For five years Bill was 
    shipping every title he released overseas and now he finds a 
    conscience? Is this any way to run a DVD company? Or did he get some 
    type of warning from some license owners of the films he sells? Bill 
    is staying mum on the subject and would rather forget about every one 
    of his customers unless they live in North America (yes, Canada can 
    get every title, but they will have to use Diabolik to get them 
    (because Bill or Brad [who is handling things in Seattle until Bill's 
    unknown return] do not want to fill out Customs forms); and pay much 
    more for the privilege). Is it any wonder Code Red customers are 
    moving over to Bill's brother Walter's Scorpion Releasing for a much 
    more stable release schedule and knowing the exact date when titles 
    are going to be released (not to mention that Walter is opening his 
    own store in the first week of October 2014 [which was pushed back, 
    but you can still buy some of his titles at his temporary Big Cartel 
    store at <A HREF="http://scorpionreleasing.bigcartel.com">scorpionreleasing.bigcartel.com</A>])?
     Surprises are fun, but when you are nowhere near your vault to 
    release what has already been pressed (and issue no press releases on 
    the dates they will be released), customers begin to leave you in 
    disgust. And his Facebook group is run like the Gestapo, which should 
    come as no surprise since the head moderator likes to dress up in 
    Nazi clothing and point her gun at another woman's head. My 
    infatuation with Code Red is rapidly fading. Bill has no one to blame 
    but Bill. Scorpion seems to be releasing the better titles now, 
    except for the Cirio H. Santiago post-nuke and Andy Milligan's films 
    that Bill has, but who knows when they will be released? <B>UPDATE #4:</B> 
    Bill Olsen has announced that three Andy Milligan films will be 
    released on Blu-Ray sometime in the middle of November, 2014 (Turns 
    out it was the end of November since Bill had an &quot;accident&quot; 
    where a bunch oh heavy boxes fell on him and he injured the left side 
    of his body. <I>cough</I>bullshit<I>cough)</I>. They are <B><A HREF="bloodthirsty_butchers_1970_blu-ray.htm">BLOODTHIRSTY

    (1974) which Bill also has the print and rights to and is probably 
    Milligan's best (and most accessible to non-Milligan fans) horror 
    film. And the <A HREF="http://www.codereddvd.com">Code Red website</A> 
    has finally been updated after more than a year of showing the same 
    DVDs (some of which are now OOP) on the homepage. <B>UPDATE #5:</B> 
    In December 2014, Code Red is offering the following films for sale: 
    A Blu-Ray of <B><A HREF="eerie_midnight_horror_show_1974_blu-ray.htm">EERIE
     MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> and DVDs of <B><A HREF="zebra_force_1976_dvd.htm">ZEBRA

    FROM HARLEM</A></B>; and <B><A HREF="six_pack_volume_three_dvd.htm">SIX
     PACK VOLUME THREE</A></B> (which Bill says will be the last because 
    the other two volumes sold so poorly, or as he puts it on the back of 
    this volume's DVD cover: &quot;Six duds in one big set. Surely you 
    must like one of them.&quot;). He keeps opening and closing his Big 
    Cartel store because he only takes 20 to 70 orders at a time, closes 
    his store, mails the orders and then reopens the store without 
    telling anyone. He supposedly gave 500 copies (including 126 copies 
    of <B>MESSIAH OF EVIL</B>) of his September 2014 Blu-Ray Four Pack to <A HREF="http://www.diabolikdvd.com">www.diabolikdvd.com</A> 
    in late November and they sold out in less than an hour (yeah, 
    right). I'm glad he has begun releasing films again, but he still 
    ignores his overseas fanbase (he seems to revel in the drama), calls 
    his customers names, such as &quot;horders&quot; (sic), puts down the 
    films he releases (on the back of one DVD cover it says 
    &quot;Pointless Code Red Trailers&quot;) and runs his business 
    without making much sense at all. I ask you, is this any way to run a 
    DVD company? <B>UPDATE #6:</B> May 3, 2015: Three new Blu-Rays 
    appeared on the Code Red Big Cartel store, <B><A HREF="obsessed_one_1976_blu-ray.htm">THE
     OBSESSED ONE</A></B> (which I really, really want!); <B><A HREF="devils_wedding_night_1973_blu-ray.htm">THE
     DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT</A></B> (I'm kind of indifferent to this one) 
    and <B><A HREF="night_child_1975_blu-ray.htm">NIGHT CHILD</A></B> 
    (good, but nothing special), but an hour after they were posted, they 
    were deleted. I'm sure that they will return on and off again 
    throughout the next few months, but it would be nice if the titles 
    stayed on the store so people could buy them at their convenience, 
    not Code Red's. Bill has also posted two new DVDs for sale: <B><A HREF="this_is_a_hijack_1973.htm">THIS
     IS A HIJACK (1973)</A></B> starring Neville Brand and a double 
    feature DVD of <B><A HREF="trip_with_the_teacher_1974_jail_bait_babysitter_1977_dvd.htm">TRIP
     WITH THE TEACHER (1974)/JAIL BAIT BABYSITTER (1977)</A></B>. After a 
    half-dozen tries, I finally managed to score all the new titles. <B>UPDATE
     #7:</B> May 26, 2015: Code Red, like Scorpion Entertainment (run by 
    Bill Olsen's brother Walter), announced some exclusive Blu-Ray titles 
    to be sold only by <A HREF="http://www.screenarchives.com">Screen 
    Archives Entertainment</A>. The titles are: <B><A HREF="shakma_1990_blu-ray.htm">SHAKMA</A></B> 
    (1990); <B><A HREF="retribution_1987_blu-ray.htm">RETRIBUTION</A></B> 
    (1987; which Code Red already released on DVD) and Tobe Hooper's <B><A HREF="spontaneous_combustion_1990_blu-ray.htm">SPONTANEOUS
     COMBUSTION</A></B> (1989). Hopefully, Code Red will offer all of 
    their future releases this way, because overseas customers will be 
    able to purchase them (even though they are more expensive than what 
    is offered on Bill's Big Cartel store). <B>UPDATE #8:</B> In one of 
    the gutsiest moves in Code Red's history, William Olsen has released 
    three of late Filipino director Cirio H. Santiago's post-nuke films 
    on Blu-Ray. They are <B><A HREF="wheels_of_fire_1984_blu-ray.htm">WHEELS
     OF FIRE</A></B> (1984); <B><A HREF="equalizer_2000_1986_blu-ray.htm">EQUALIZER
     2000</A></B> (1986; it it's uncut form, the first time in the U.S.) 
    and <B><A HREF="sisterhood_1987_blu-ray.htm">THE SISTERHOOD</A></B> 
    (1987). Since I am a HUGE Cirio H. Santiago fan, I ordered these from 
    Screen Archives Entertainment as soon as they became available (and 
    they were delivered to me four days later). Here's hoping that Bill 
    Olsen continues to take chances like this (Blue Underground released 
    a trio of Italian post-nuke films around the same time) and get all 
    of Santiago's post-nuke films, such as <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Stryker1983">STRYKER</A></B> 
    (1983), <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#DuneWarriors">DUNE </A></B></FONT></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="BLACK"><A HREF="science fiction.htm#DuneWarriors">WARRIORS</A></FONT></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="BLACK"> 
    (1990) and <B><A HREF="action.htm#RaidersOfTheSun">RAIDERS OF THE SUN</A></B> 
    (1991) on DVD or Blu-Ray. If he does, I'll be one of the happiest 
    people in the world. Buy these discs, people, and let Code Red 
    thrive! <B>UPDATE #9:</B> Since I have quit Facebook and all their 
    bullshit, I no longer have anything bad to say about Bill, because he 
    keeps his Big Cartel open without closing it down, allowing me to 
    purchase some OOP DVDs that would have cost me a lot more from Amazon 
    Sellers or on eBay (His store is chock-full of back-dated goodies, 
    but make sure you click on the &quot;All&quot; button to see the 
    second page of DVDs &amp; Blu-Rays or you'll be missing out on a lot 
    of goodies.). He also has released a few more Blu-Rays on Screen 
    Archives Entertainment that are exclusive, including Andy Milligan's <B><A HREF="rats_are_coming_the_werewolves_are_here_1972_blu-ray.htm">THE
     RATS ARE COMING...THE WEREWOLVES ARE HERE</A></B> (1972) and <B><A HREF="legacy_of_satan_1972_blood_1974_blu-ray.htm">LEGACY
     OF SATAN (1972)/BLOOD (1974)</A></B> (thanks for <B>BLOOD</B>, Bill, 
    and it looks like it's in its uncut form for the first time on home 
    video!), making me a very happy man. Other Code Red Blu-Ray 
    exclusives are <B><A HREF="terror_circus_1974-blu-ray.htm">TERROR CIRCUS</A></B> 
    (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Barn Naked Dead">BARN OF THE 
    NAKED DEAD</A></B> - 1974; which has already been released three 
    times on Code Red DVD) and the Italian crime film <B><A HREF="sicilian_connection_1973_blu-ray.htm">THE
     SICILIAN CONNECTION</A></B> (1973) starring the late Ben Gazzara. I 
    have to say I am delighted to see Code Red thrive and Bill doing so 
    well. Now, if he would just answer my emails! <B>UPDATE #10:</B> It 
    looks like Code Red is strictly in the Blu-Ray market now, as they 
    haven't released a new DVD (except for <B><A HREF="splitz_1982_dvd.htm">SPLITZ</A></B> 
    - 1982) in over half a year. Their newest Blu-Ray releases are three 
    Cirio H. Santiago treasures released by Screen Archives Entertainment 
    only: <B><A HREF="devastator_1985_blu-ray.htm">THE DEVASTATOR</A></B> 
    (1985), <B><A HREF="silk_1986_blu-ray.htm">SILK</A></B> (1986) and <B><A HREF="dune_warriors_1990_blu-ray.htm">DUNE
     WARRIORS</A></B> (1990; with 15 minutes of footage restored that 
    Roger Corman edited out. A special shout-out to Bill for releasing 
    this one since I've been wanting it on disc for a long, long time.). 
    He also released some Blu-Rays of his previous DVD releases in his 
    Big Cartel store. Time for DVD-only people to upgrade because these 
    Santiago &amp; Milligan Blu-Ray titles look like they were filmed 
    yesterday! Not all of Bill's recent releases need to be on Blu-Ray, 
    but I really appreciate the time spent to put together the Milligan 
    films. And it couldn't have been easy with the Santiago films, 
    either. But films like <B><A HREF="cut_throats_nine_1972_blu-ray.htm">CUT-THROATS

    April 12, 2016: Bill has finally released a batch of new DVDs that 
    are available on his Big Cartel store only. Some of the titles 
    include (all the films are in anamorphic widescreen): <B><A HREF="spasms_dvd_1982.htm">SPASMS</A></B>

    martial art films on two DVDs. There are even more titles, which I 
    will be buying and scanning when Bill re-opens his Big Cartel store. <B>UPDATE
     #13:</B> July 14, 2016: Bill Olsen continues to surprise. After 
    watching the trailer on nearly every Code Red release, Bill has 
    finally released <B><A HREF="family_honor_1973_blu-ray.htm">FAMILY HONOR</A></B> 
    (1973) on Blu-Ray, along with the late Wayne Crawford-starrer <B><A HREF="headhunter_1989_blu-ray.htm">HEADHUNTER</A></B>

     also on Blu-Ray for the first time on home video (I ordered it 
    immediately and received it in three days! Lucky for me I did, 
    because it looks like it sold out. <B>NOTE:</B> William Olsen 
    actually pulled the Blu-Ray from his store because it was the 
    PG-Rated Version and not the hard-to-find original R-Rated Version as 
    it says on the sleeve. This is the reason why small labels get called 
    names. I ordered the other two titles a couple of days later and 
    received them in two days! Thanks, Bill, but next time at least do 
    some investigation of the film versions you are releasing.). Bill 
    also has plenty of other surprises on the horizon (He just released <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Maniac! 1976">MANIAC!</A></B> 
    [1977] and <B><A HREF="black_gestapo_1975_blu-ray.htm">THE BLACK GESTAPO</A></B>

    deal with a huge Italian distributor) and other slasher and 
    exploitation films from the 70's &amp; 80's. Now if he would only get

    when Bill's brother, Walter Olsen, and his label Scorpion Releasing 
    just released the film on BR, in an uncut &quot;extended composite 
    cut&quot; (91 min), as well as the 89-minute &quot;shorter 
    version&quot;. There are no extras on the disc, but I have been 
    waiting for an uncut version to be released in the States before I 
    would review it. I owe Paul Naschy at least that much. Look for a 
    review soon.</FONT></FONT></P>

     16, 2014: One of the Encore pay cable channels just ran the uncut 
    version of Meir Zarchi's <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave.htm">I SPIT 
    ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B> (1978). They advertise it as the R-rated 
    version, but believe me, it is the uncut version. I thought it was a 
    misprint on my DVR and they were actually going to show an R-Rated 
    version of the <A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave_2010.htm">2010 remake</A>,
     but imagine my surprise when I saw it was the uncut print of the 
    original version. I still like the 2010 version better (of which a <A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave_2_2013.htm">sequel</A> 
    was made in 2013), but it took balls to release this 70's classic of 
    rape and vengeance on TV. As far as I know this was the first time it 
    was ever shown uncut on television. Or shown on television at all. 
    Too bad it was a fullscreen version, but for people who have never 
    seen it and watched it for the first time (especially the bathtub 
    penis slicing), it must have been quite the eye-opener with 
    continuous rape, both male and female full-frontal nudity and 
    shocking bits of violence. I remember showing this on VHS to a bunch 
    of friends (mostly female) during the early 90's while we were down 
    at the Jersey Shore and they still talk about it till this day. It's 
    one of those movies that never leaves your brain once you have seen 
    it. To show it in its full uncut glory on TV took guts. I checked for 
    the next two weeks and it is not on their schedule to be shown again, 
    but just showing it once is a milestone in TV. It's not like when FX 
    aired a heavily edited version of Wes Craven's <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST
     HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> (1972) on their channel. This was the real 
    unadulterated deal. Bravo, Encore. Bravo. What's next,<B> <A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nekromantik">NEKROMANTIK</A></B> 
    (1987)? <B>UPDATE:</B> Encore Suspense has two showings on Saturday 
    April 19, 2014 starting at 11:05 PM. Set your DVRs! <B>NOTE:</B> 
    Encore Suspense also showed the 2010 remake on September 1, 2014 in 
    widescreen. It was advertised as the R-Rated version, but it was also 
    the Unrated version. I'm impressed that even pay cable stations would 
    show these films. <B>UPDATE #2:</B> On April 9, 2016, Encore Suspense 
    showed all three recent movies, including <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave_2_2013.htm">Part
     2</A></B> (2013) &amp; <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave_3_vengeance_is_mine_2015.htm">Part
     3</A></B> (2015). Just like before, they advertized them as the

    - a recently new zine (20 issues so far, which includes 3 half issues 
    and a #0) that covers everything from American to Mexican, Malaysian 
    and other foreign weirdness. Not available by subscription, but 
    issues can be picked up easily online from Amazon. A great read from 
    beginning to end. I really loved the article and interview in Issue 3 
    with the owner on Mark IV Productions, who made those religious films 
    like <B><A HREF="thief_in_the_night_1972.htm">A THIEF IN THE NIGHT</A></B>,
     <B><A HREF="distant_thunder_1978.htm">A DISTANT THUNDER</A></B>, <B><A HREF="image_of_the_beast_1980.htm">IMAGE

    PRODIGAL PLANET</A></B> in the 70's &amp; 80's. Be prepared to spend 
    hours with each issue, because most issues are binded and run over 
    100 pages. This is not your father's home-made zine. One of my 
    favorites as soon as I started to read the first issue. Editor &amp; 
    Publisher Brian Harris and Editor &amp; Designer Timothy Paxton have 
    turned out a zine full of rare ad mats and photos from films you 
    likely never heard of before. This should be an instant buy for 
    readers of this site. <B>NOTE:</B> Issue #5 is an astounding 265 
    pages long. This sucker is not a magazine, it's a fricking book! And 
    a fricking good book at that. Another major plus is that there are no 
    advertisements, which makes the 265 pages all meat and no filler. 
    What are you waiting for? Go to Amazon and order it ASAP!<B> NOTE #2</B>:
     Issue #6 is another monstrosity; a staggering 240 pages<B><A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/weng's chop number 11.5 front cover small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="215" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A></B> 
    of everything you could demand in a horror magazine and more. Author 
    Steve Fenton does his usual amazing job in Part 2 of his extensive 
    article of jungle women films (you'd be surprised how many there 
    are!) and lists reviews of all the films that start with the letter M 
    to the letter Z; Brian Harris writes about the trilogy of Japanese <B><A HREF="rape_zombie_lust_of_the_dead_trilogy_2012-2013.htm">RAPE
     ZOMBIE</A></B> films (new to me); writer George Pacheco writes about 
    the <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR WARS</A></B> rip-off films 
    of director Al Bradley (a.k.a, Alfonso Brescia); Author Troy Howarth 
    writes about the WIP films of director Jess Franco (my least favorite 
    director, but the article is good); There's a great long 
    collaborative article by Brian Harris and George Pacheco about the 
    waning years (1987- 1992) of Italian horror films, with extensive 
    reviews of all the films of the period (my second favorite article of 
    the issue); Writer Peter Davis has a look at the <B><A HREF="saw_massacre_german_franchise_2008-2010.htm">SAW
     MASSACRE</A></B> trilogy (so far) of films. If you never heard of <B>SAW
     MASSACRE</B>, don't worry. They are just German retitlings of films 
    like <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KnockKnock">KNOCK KNOCK</A></B> 
    (2006) that can be found on this website; Writer Louis Paul writes a 
    nice article about mostly 70's pornography films that contain horror 
    elements; Brian Harris interviews Andrew Allan of <A HREF="http://www.CultMovieMania.com">Cult
     Movie Mania</A>, who releases films like <B><A HREF="bloody_bloody_bible_camp_2011.htm">BLOODY
     BLOODY BIBLE CAMP</A></B> (2011), usually in both VHS and DVD 
    incarnations; Harris also interviews horror artist Kelly Forbes and 
    illustrator/comics creator Joe Deagnon; Phillip Root does an 
    extensive article on the low-budget 1985 gore film <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Bits And Pieces">BITS
     AND PIECES</A></B> and talks to director Leland Thomas, who explains 
    how Trans World Entertainment made him remove some gore shots from 
    the VHS release (photos of which we see in the article) and that all 
    the missing film shots were destroyed, although he still retains a 
    1&quot; tape master of them; My favorite article of the issue: a 
    collaborative look and review of all the mid-Century beach films, 
    whether horror-based or not. This article runs for over 30 pages and 
    is chock-full of information of films you may have never heard of 
    before; Stephen R. Bissette takes a look at the 1964 <B><A HREF="horror_of_party_beach_1964.htm">HORROR
     OF PARTY BEACH</A></B> photo comic (I still own mine from when I 
    originally bought it as a kid); Bissette also does a great article on 
    fairy tale horror films; A long overdue look at what films Godfrey Ho 
    used as the basis of his cut-and-paste films by writer Jeff Goodhartz 
    (I hope this is a continuing article in future issues); An obituary 
    section by Steven Ronquillo; a bunch of film reviews for movies not 
    usually given the respect they are due; another article on Jess 
    Franco, this time Greek VHS tapes of his films and so much more.&nbsp;
     It's about time everyone jumped aboard the WENG'S CHOP train and 
    enjoyed the ride. It only costs a measly $12.00 and will give you the 
    satisfaction that so few horror zines today do. <B>NOTE #3:</B> Issue 
    #6.5 is a digest-sized 109-page special issue that is smaller in size 
    and page numbers, but still has the high level of writing we come to 
    expect from Brian, Tim, Tony &amp; Steve. After a mostly funny series 
    of editorials about Halloween by Brian, Tony and Tim (who still 
    manages to throw in a couple of little-known Indian family-friendly 
    fantasy films into his editorial), there's a 25-page review section 
    of genre films from the 1950's &amp; 60's (<B><A HREF="leech_woman_1960.htm">THE
     LEECH WOMAN</A></B> - 1960) till today (<B><A HREF="werewolf_rising_2014.htm">WEREWOLF
     RISING</A></B> - 2014), some (like writer Steve Fenton's review of 
    the Jack Palance-starrer <B><A HREF="craze_1973.htm">CRAZE</A></B> - 
    1973) getting more space than others. All the reviews are written by 
    different people and are enjoyable reads that make you want to go out 
    and buy some (which I plan to do on Amazon once I am done with this 
    review). We then move to the interview section, where the first 
    person to be interviewed is director Daniel Stamm (<B><A HREF="last_exorcism_2010_last_exorcism_part_2_2013.htm">THE
     LAST EXORCISM</A></B> - 2010; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#T13Sins2014">13
     SINS</A></B> - 2014; both films I found highly entertaining) by 
    writer Art Stevenson, which covers Stamm's career in films from the 
    beginning and is very informative. The next article is Stevenson's 
    interview with director Marcus Dunston, who was the architect of the <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW</A></B> 
    film franchise (2004 - 2010) and directed the effective home invasion 
    flicks <B><A HREF="collector_2009.htm">THE COLLECTOR</A></B> (2009) 
    and its sequel <B><A HREF="collection_2012.htm">THE COLLECTION</A></B> 
    (2012), which were twisty, booby-trapped horror films. Next up is 
    Louis Paul's collection of reviews of 70's porno films, back when 
    porno had a plot as well as hardcore sex. I'm not a big porno fan, 
    but Louis could make ice an interesting subject to Eskimos. Following 
    that is Part 1 of George Pacheco's overview of strange director Mario 
    Siciliano, who made Italian porno films, while directing weird 
    non-porn films like <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EvilEye1975">EVIL EYE</A></B> 
    (1975) and <B><A HREF="action.htm#Rolf">ROLF</A></B> (1983; his last 
    film). Siciliano made 16 films between 1974 and 1983, the majority of 
    them being hardcore porn films. Pacheco does a great job of 
    describing the films of this obviously deranged director and I can't 
    wait to read Part 2. Next up is Brian Harris' article on the six most 
    ridiculous shark films of the past nine years and I couldn't agree 
    with his choices more (He wisely avoids the <B><A HREF="sharknado_2013.htm">SHARKNADO</A></B> <A HREF="sharknado_2_the_second_one_2014.htm">franchise</A> 
    because we all know how awful they are), although I do like <B><A HREF="hammerhead_shark_frenzy_2005.htm">HAMMERHEAD:
     SHARK FRENZY</A></B> (2005), just for the stupidity of it all. 
    Author Stephen R. Bissette then goes into a lengthy review of 
    director Kevin Smith's horror film <B><A HREF="tusk_2014.htm">TUSK</A></B> 
    (2014), which he advises those who have not seen the film not to read 
    his article until they do (I'm also in the minority of liking Smith's 
    other horror film <B><A HREF="red_state_2011.htm">RED STATE</A></B> - 
    2011). I have seen the film and agree (mostly) with Stephen's 
    assessment of it. Up next is the strangest article in the issue: 
    Writer James Bickert's pairing of the top 10 pumpkin beers and the 
    films each one should be watched with. I don't know where James 
    (a.k.a. &quot;Dirty Uncle Jimbo&quot;) came up with this novel idea, 
    but it sure as hell was an entertaining read. We then move on to Tony 
    Strauss' article on the lesser-known Halloween animated TV specials, 
    many that haven't been shown after they originally aired. Did you 
    known The Grinch made a Halloween special? Well, he did, in 1977. 
    Following that is Christos Mouroukis and Christoforos Theodorou's 
    career retrospective of Greek director Nikos Nikolaidis, who is best 
    known to western audiences for directing the violent and 
    controversial <B><A HREF="singapore_sling_1990.htm">SINGAPORE SLING</A></B> 
    (1990), but as you will read, he made much stranger films than this 
    and was also a novelist and TV commercial director, to boot! The 
    always-enjoyable Steven Ronquillo then offers his recollections of 
    his favorite 70's &amp; early-80's Halloween TV shows, including <B><A HREF="paul_lynde_halloween_special_1976.htm">THE
     PAUL LYNDE HALLOWEEN SPECIAL</A></B> (1976; the expression on 
    Lynde's face when he first looks at rock group KISS is priceless!) 
    and the highly effective 1981 Halloween horror film, <B><A HREF="dark_night_of_the_scarecrow_1981.htm">THE
     DARK NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW</A></B>. The issue closes out with a 
    review of author Lee Lambert's book &quot;The Illustrated History Of 
    Don Post Studios&quot; and bios on all the writers who contributed to 
    this issue. Once again another winner of an issue, which is all 
    information and no advertisements. Please pass on the information to 
    all your friends how good WENG'S CHOP is and how nothing in the DIY 
    zine universe comes close to this in sheer informational and 
    entertainment value. <B>NOTE #4:</B> WENG'S CHOP still holds the 
    mantle for best DIY zine well into 2015. The only thing I wish is 
    that it was published on a regular schedule like sister zine 
    MONSTER!. But each issue is giant in page numbers (with no 
    advertizing) and well worth the wait.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    with a toe tag from &quot;D'Amato Morgue&quot;, a nice little extra. 
    In other words another winner of an issue. Here's hoping EVILSPEAK 
    lasts a long, long time. <B>NOTE #2:</B> Still waiting for Issue #4 
    to drop (Issue #3 was the size of a book and crammed full of great 
    articles), since they promised it was going to be over 300 pages 
    long. Now that's dedication! <B>NOTE #3:</B> Issue #4 dropped and 
    it's a giant 210 page monster, crammed with articles (including a 
    Pete Walker/David McGillivray retrospective; glad I'm not the only 
    one who is a fan of <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Comeback">THE COMEBACK</A></B>&nbsp;

    reason this is one of my favorite zines (even though it is more like 
    a book) and I keep an extra issue in my bathroom for those long dump 
    breaks (That's a compliment, not a put-down.). Get on Amazon and 
    order a copy ASAP. <B>NOTE #4:</B> Issue #5 (200 pages) will be the 
    beginning of the zine being published once a year. So we will have to

     <A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm">MONSTER!</A></B> - 
    Founder/Editor/Jack-Of-All-Trades Tim Paxton has revived his old 
    publication and I am glad to report that if your thing is for monster 
    films, than this is the publication for you. Filled with reviews of 
    monster films from around the world, Issue #2 (it is published 
    monthly) is filled with reviews from America, Mexico, India and Hong 
    Kong for a lot of films I never heard of, so each 66 to 70 page issue 
    (professionally bound like Paxton's WENG'S CHOP, but in a digest 
    format) was a wellspring of new information to me. That makes it an 
    essential purchase. Subscriptions are not available, though 
    individual issues can be purchased online from Amazon. Everyone likes 
    monster films, but learning about monster films you never heard of 
    before just makes it all the sweeter. <B>NOTE:</B> Issue #3 is now 
    available and if you like Bigfoot films or monster films from Canada, 
    this is a must-buy issue. And Steve Ronquillo continues his excellent 
    article on the monster films of India's The Ramsay Brothers. I may 
    have to move this zine up a number or two if it gets any better! (and 
    it probably will). I would also like to thank Issue #3 for making me 
    take a chance on seeing <B><A HREF="pacific_rim_2013.htm">PACIFIC RIM</A></B> 
    (2013). What a great film! I would have passed it by if not for Brian 
    Harris' review. <B>NOTE #2:</B> Issue #4 is now available and it is 
    its regular great read, especially author Douglas Waltz's &quot;Bottom
     Of The Barrell Bigfoot&quot; article of reviews of the worst recent 
    Bigfoot films that escaped on home video for public consumption. 
    Sorry to say that I have already seen most of them and could have 
    used this article months ago. <B>NOTE #3:</B> Issue #5 has now been 
    released and is it has its usually excellent writing. It has an 
    article on the Filipino <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Brides Of Blood">BLOOD
     TRILOGY</A></B> that blows the article in GRINDHOUSE PURGATORY #2 
    out of the water, mainly because writer Louis Paul tosses-in his 
    personal history with those films. Seriously, if you want to learn 
    about monster films from all around the world you have never heard of 
    before, you can do not better than MONSTER! This issue has many 
    reviews (including a lengthly review of <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Octaman1970">OCTAMAN</A></B> 
    and one of my 80's favorites, <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Island Claws">ISLAND
     CLAWS</A></B>), as well as a timely retrospective of Godzilla films 
    and other juicy goodies. If I haven't convinced you on buying an 
    issue (it's only $5.00, for crying out loud!), then you just plain 
    don't like monster movies. And I pity you.<B> NOTE #4:</B> Issue #6 
    has just been released and it's another winner. Inside its 74 pages 
    are really informative articles on <B><A HREF="abominable_snowman_1957.htm">THE
     ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN OF THE HIMALAYAS</A></B>, <B><A HREF="cyclops_1957.htm">THE

    on <B><A HREF="dunwich_horror_1970.htm">THE DUNWICH HORROR</A></B> 
    (1970) and how star Dean Stockwell brought something fresh to his 
    role as H.P. Lovecraft's Wilber Whateley (detouring from Lovecraft's 
    version and adding a hippie aspect to the proceedings), &quot;found 
    footage&quot; monster movies (God, how I hate them!), Dracula movies 
    and the usual reviews of monster films from around the world that 
    many of you probably never heard of (and thankfully, I'm not the only 
    one who thinks <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#FrankensteinsArmy13">FRANKENSTEIN'S
     ARMY</A></B> is unique, even if it is considered a &quot;found 
    footage&quot; film). So get off your fat lazy asses and buy this 
    issue now. Hell, stay on your fat bums and order it from Amazon off 
    your computer! <B>NOTE #5:</B> Issue #7 contains the usual excellent 
    reviews of monster films around the world, plus special features of 
    sexy vampire films (complete with nudity), Taiwanese and Indian 
    fantasy films (some of them you have to read to believe!) and 
    articles on <B><A HREF="hand_of_death_1962.htm">HAND OF DEATH</A></B> 
    (1962) and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Incredible Melting">THE 
    INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN</A></B> (1977) and and Steven M. Ronquillo's 
    interview with director Christopher R. Mihm, who directed the 2013

     which Ronquillo reviews after the interview (I may just have to buy 
    this one!). Another outstanding issue that even has a review of the 
    first episode FX's new series <B><A HREF="strain_tv_series_2014.htm">THE
     STRAIN</A></B>. <B>NOTE #6:</B> Issue #8 may be the best issue yet. 
    Editor/Jack-of-all- trades Tim Paxton continues with Part 5 of his 
    look at the House Of Ramsay, India's premiere film company of monster 
    weirdness (Can't wait for the book Tim!). I always learn something 
    new with these articles and it wants me to see them all the more. 
    Greg Goodsell looks at Roger Corman's <B><A HREF="not_of_this_earth_1957.htm">NOT
     OF THIS EARTH</A></B> (1957) and the two remakes (1988 &amp; 1995) 
    and offers more information on the movie then I ever heard of before. 
    Great article. Brian Harris interviews <B><A HREF="13_eerie_2012.htm">13
     EERIE</A></B> (2012) and <B><A HREF="wolfcop_2014.htm">WOLFCOP</A></B> 
    (2014) director Lowell Dean. If you haven't seen the movie, I suggest 
    you do. There's a slew of monster movie reviews, including an 
    extended review of <B><A HREF="knights_of_badassdom_2013.htm">KNIGHTS 
    OF BADASSDOM</A></B> (2013) by Adam Parker-Edmondston. An extended 
    and detailed look at all the Paul Naschy/Waldemar Daninsky werewolf 
    films in chronological order by writer Louis Paul and where you can 
    find them for purchase. (Naschy is a horror hero of mine, which is 
    why his obituary, along with Forrest J Ackerman's, will never be 
    taken off the home page of this site). Stephen R. Bissette takes a 
    long look at pre-1970's fungus horror films (Why has no one thought 
    of this before and why is the theme song for <B><A HREF="green_slime_1968.htm">THE
     GREEN SLIME</A></B> now occupying my brain?). And, of course, the 
    always helpful movie checklist at the end of this 74 page zine which 
    allows you to locate any film reviewed in the issue by just looking 
    up the title, along with tidbits of information about each film not 
    mentioned in the actual reviews themselves. All zines should have 
    this feature because it make looking up a title extremely easy. 
    Please support this zine by buying all the issues you may have missed 
    and if you haven't bought an issue yet: Shame on you. One of the few 
    zines I read in one sitting from cover to cover without looking at 
    the clock and watching the hours click away. Another great job, Tim! <B>NOTE
     #7:</B> Issue #9 hit Amazon in late September and it's another 
    interesting issue. It opens with Stephen R. Bissette's lengthy and 
    informative article on the 1959 Swedish monster film <B><A HREF="rymd_invasion_i_lappland_1959.htm">RYMD
     INVASION I LAPPLAND</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="terror_in_the_midnight_sun_1959.htm">TERROR
     IN THE MIDNIGHT SUN</A></B>) and the Jerry Gross re-edit (with added 
    scenes of John Carradine)&nbsp; which turned it into the 
    incomprehensible 1962 mess <B><A HREF="invasion_of_the_animal_people_1959_1962.htm">INVASION
     OF THE ANIMAL PEOPLE</A></B>, (much in the same way <B><A HREF="reptilicus_1961.htm">REPTILICUS</A></B> 
    was treated). It shows how Jerry Gross made his bones early in his 
    career by recutting foreign films and then selling them to theaters 
    and TV. Definitely an interesting retrospect, complete with 
    interviews of late screenwriter Arthur C. Pierce and late director 
    Virgel W. Vogel, who both offer their personal experiences working on 
    the film and what was done to it after they finished it; extensive 
    reviews of plenty of monster films around the world, including <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Voodoo Black">VOODOO
     BLACK EXORCIST</A></B> (1973) and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Escape Coral Cove">ESCAPE
     FROM CORAL COVE</A></B> (1986). We then go to Part 1 of writer Steve 
    Fenton's look into the killer cat genre (they're not quite 
    werewolves, but just as dangerous), as he starts from the beginning 
    of the genre, with 1946's <B><A HREF="catman_of_paris_1946.htm">THE 
    CATMAN OF PARIS</A></B> and works his way to the TV film <B><A HREF="cat_creature_1973.htm">THE
     CAT CREATURE</A></B> (1973) for the first installment of this 
    excellent series. Tim Paxton then does my favorite part of this zine, 
    writing Part 6 of his exhaustive examination of the monster films of 
    India's infamous House Of Ramsay. The sheer amount of monster films 
    they turned out cries for some DVD company to subtitle these films on 
    DVD or Blu-Ray and release them in the U.S. All Tim had were mostly 
    badly-mastered VCDs or Indian-language only DVDs. If more people 
    (besides the Indian population, that is) watched these films, they 
    would become instant classics because of their sheer weirdness. But 
    the same goes for the Hong Kong horror films I<A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/monster issue 34 winter 2019 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    have been touting for years on my website, but they still don't have 
    the audience they deserve. I'm glad Tim does this series, because 
    there are some of us in the U.S. interested in these films and 
    appreciate him doing us the favor. You get all this for a measly 
    $5.00. If you like monsters, $5.00 is all you need to get your 
    monthly fix. I can't go an issue without buying some film they review 
    or talk about. If that's not what is excellent about this zine, I 
    don't know what else is (besides the excellent writing). <B>NOTE #8:</B> 
    Issue #10 has streeted just in time for Halloween 2014 and it is a 
    giant 100-page ad-free monstrosity (that's a good thing!). After a 
    funny editorial by co-editor Tim Paxton about Halloween costumes and 
    what MONSTER! stands for, he begins the issue with a review/insight 
    piece on the non-Ramsay Bros. Indian monster film <B><A HREF="khooni_panja_1991.htm">KHOONI
     PANJA</A></B> (1991; a.k.a. &quot;<I>Bloody Hand</I>&quot;), which 
    flopped at the Indian boxoffice, but still sounds interesting. A girl 
    named Pinky is possessed by the corpse of the ex-wife (her hand 
    reaches up from the dirt and grabs Pinky before she is able to 
    struggle free) of the husband who murdered her in the graveyard where 
    she caught him with his future bride (ah, a graveyard, how 
    romantic!), vowing revenge on all those who have anything to do with 
    her husband. Too bad that Pinky is about to become the sister-in-law 
    of the murderous husband and his ex-wifey won't let a shallow grave 
    keep her down. All kinds of supernatural things happen (Pinky's eyes 
    glow when she is possessed), including the appearance of a monster 
    that in Tim's words &quot;reminds me of William Sach's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Incredible Melting">THE
     INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN</A></B> (1976)&quot; and that's all I needed 
    to hear for the film to pique my interest. You'll have to read the 
    rest of the review for yourself. Tim then goes on to review a 2014 
    Indian monster film called <B><A HREF="creature_3d_2014.htm">CREATURE 3D</A></B>,
     which also bombed at the box office and has some terrible CGI, but 
    Tim makes me want to see it anyway. We then get four monster film 
    reviews, including <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">ANTHR</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">O</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">POPHAGUS</A></B> 
    (1980; a.k.a. <B><A HREF="grim_reaper_1980.htm">THE GRIM REAPER</A></B>),
     its supposed sequel <B><A HREF="absurd_1981.htm">ABSURD</A></B> 
    (1981; released here in the States as <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Monster Hunter">MONSTER
     HUNTER</A></B>), <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#CastleOfBlood1964">CASTLE
     OF BLOOD</A></B> (1964) and <B><A HREF="halloween_3_season_of_the_witch_1982.htm">HALLOWEEN
     III: SEASON OF THE WITCH</A></B> (1982; where the monsters are 
    mostly implied rather than shown), all written by different 
    reviewers. Noted author/researcher Troy Howarth then does a really 
    nice article on the Cornish Horror films that Hammer Films made in 
    the early-to-mid-60's (complete with some nice photos and comic art). 
    Writer Louis Paul then takes us on a welcome journey back to the 
    monster films and shows made expressly for television in the 70's, 
    including such MFTV gems as <B><A HREF="night_stalker_tv_movie_1972.htm">THE
     NIGHT STALKER</A></B> and <B><A HREF="night_strangler_1973.htm">THE 
    NIGHT STRANGLER</A></B> (1973), which led to the sadly short lived <B><A HREF="kolchak_the_night_stalker_tv_series_1974-1975.htm">KOLCHAK:
     THE NIGHT STALKER</A></B> TV series (1974-1975). It's a fun look 
    back at a time when watching original movies for TV was an event 
    because we didn't have 500 channels of reality TV to choose from. 
    God, I miss those days! Steve Fenton then gives us his second part 
    (continued from Issue #9) on the Killer Cat genre, this time avoiding 
    the films that came from the West (like <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Night 1000 Cats">NIGHT
     OF 1000 CATS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#CorpseGrinders">THE
     CORPSE GRINDERS</A></B>) and concentrating on those that came from 
    the Far East. I guarantee than you haven't heard of many of them and 
    this lengthy article goes all-out to make you want to track them down 
    so you can watch them. Thankfully, Fenton offers an appendix of what 
    companies has these available on disc and VHS (but a lot of them 
    still remain unavailable to Western audiences). It's a great piece 
    and a nice history of a genre hardly written about. Let's hope Steve 
    does a Part 3 in the near future. There are plenty of American (<B><A HREF="eye_of_the_cat_1969.htm">EYE
     OF THE CAT</A></B> - 1969), Canadian (<B><A HREF="uncanny_1977.htm">THE
     UNCANNY</A></B> - 1977) and Italian films (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SevenDeathsCatsEyes">SEVEN
     DEATHS IN THE CAT'S EYES</A></B> - 1973) that deal with killer 
    kitties. Writer John Harrison does a nice retrospective piece on 
    remembering Don Post masks (remember those ads in FAMOUS MONSTERS OF 
    FILMLAND?) and gives us a photo tour of his creations. Finally, 
    author Steven R. Bissette does my favorite piece in this issue, which 
    is surprising to me, because I was never a fan of comics. But he 
    takes a look back at the horror comics of the early 60's, giving us a 
    large history of what company put out what stories and the troubles 
    with the by-then outdated Comics Code and then goes on in length to 
    discuss the one comic story that I did read and it kept me up for 
    weeks. It was titled &quot;<I>The Monster Of Dread End...</I>&quot; 
    and concerned a giant snake-like creature with a giant claw instead 
    of a head and how it chased a boy around town, Now I grew up around 
    snakes in the wild and was never scared of them, but this story was 
    the most violent thing my six year old mind had ever laid eyes upon 
    (especially the ending) and it wasn't until the introduction of the 
    no-holds barred comics zines CREEPY and EERIE (along with other 
    non-Warren Publication horror comic zines) in the 70's that I would 
    finally get that image out of my mind. I was never a big buyer of 
    horror comics, but did pick up some due to their lurid covers, but 
    nothing (besides the comic Bruce Jones wrote that Dario Argento would 
    based his episode of <B><A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">MASTERS 
    OF HORROR</A></B> called &quot;<I>Jenifer</I>&quot; on in 2005) will 
    ever get that final image out of my mind. Thanks, Steven R. Bissette, 
    for bringing up old nightmares. And that is a compliment! The only 
    thing I miss here is Tim Paxton's continuing series of the monster 
    films of India's House Of Ramsay, but there is so much to read and 
    learn from here, I can wait another issue to get my Ramsay fix. This 
    issue is a steal at $5.95 so get to ordering it ASAP! <B>NOTE #9:</B> 
    Issue #11, shipped at the end of November 2014 and was renamed <B>KAIJ&Uuml;!</B> 
    for this issue only. If you don't know what Kaij&ucirc; is, you 
    really need to catch up on your giant monster knowledge.This is a 
    larger than normal 93-page issue and it is full of many interesting 
    articles, photos, drawings and ad mats on monster films, most of them 
    the giant monster kind. The issue opens with a series of reviews by 
    different writers of giant monster films from around the world, my 
    favorite being Steve Fenton's review of the highly awful nearly 
    30-minute short <B><A HREF="fear_force_five_2013.htm">FEAR FORCE FIVE</A></B> 
    (2013), which was presented as three 9 minute chapters (I saw them on 
    YouTube) and was directed by Jack Perez using the pseudonym &quot;Ace 
    Hannah&quot;. Since Perez is a person known for directing and writing 
    the extremely bad CGI films from The Asylum (<B><A HREF="mega_shark_vs_giant_octopus_2009.htm">MEGA
     SHARK VS. GIANT OCTOPUS</A></B> - 2009), it should tell you how bad 
    this short film really is and, therefore, should be seen by anyone 
    who love crappy giant monster films, but shortened by nearly one 
    hour. Believe me, when you see a <A HREF="fear_force_five_2013_shark_eye_photo.htm">shark
     pop out</A> of the giant monster's (dressed as a pirate!) left eye 
    to chow-down on what is obviously a doll, you'll either be laughing 
    hysterically or looking at your watch and wondering &quot;Can thirty 
    minutes actually be this slow?&quot;&nbsp; After the extensive 
    reviews, we then come to the &quot;The Great Giant Ape War Of 
    1976/1977&quot;, where writer John Harrison compares director Paul

    (1976); director Frank Agrama's abysmal kitchen sink comedy <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Queen Kong">QUEEN
     KONG</A></B> (1976) and director Ho Meng Wa's extremely enjoyable <B><A HREF="mighty_peking_man_1977.htm">THE
     MIGHTY PEKING MAN</A></B> (1977; originally released to U.S. 
    theatrical audiences as the slightly edited <B><A HREF="goliathon_1977.htm">GOLIATHON</A></B>).
     It's an extremely interesting article on how films from around the 
    world tried to copy the Dino De Laurentiis remake of <B><A HREF="king_kong_1976.htm">KING
     KONG</A></B> (1976). We then get examples of great artist Alex Ward 
    and his paintings of Japanese Kaij&ucirc; flicks, including the lost 
    Tura Satana-starrer <B><A HREF="violent_planet_1968.htm">VIOLENT PLANET</A></B> 
    (1968; it seems that not only the monsters were giant!). We then go 
    on to an extensive article about all the Quatermass theatrical and TV 
    films and the people that played Professor Quatermass. It is an 
    enlightening and incisive look at the history of the eventual Hammer 
    series by the always knowledgeable Louis Paul. We then get to my 
    favorite article in this issue: Author Stephen R. Bissette's 26-page 
    look how the film <B><A HREF="godzilla_vs_megalon_1976.htm">GODZILLA 
    VS. MEGALON</A></B> rocked him and the father and son sitting behind 
    him in <A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/monster issue 31 november 2016 cover small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>theaters
     during 1976. It is not only a fun nostalgic look at the past, but 
    also an informative piece of <A HREF="godzilla_films_1954-1977.htm">Godzilla
     history</A> up until that time, how readers of FAMOUS MONSTERS OF 
    FILMLAND hated articles and cover art on Japanese monster films (I 
    did not know that), how much footage distributor Cinema Shares 
    International cut from the film in order for it to receive a G-Rating 
    (some of the edits make sense, but most of them don't.), the 
    incredible story of how it was shown in Prime Time on NBC in a one 
    hour time slot in 1977 with host John Belushi donning a cheap 
    Godzilla suit and doing his shtick (!), and how the film fell into 
    public domain hell and was released on many budget VHS versions in 
    unwatchable condition over the years (The full version has since been 
    released uncut on widescreen DVD by Media Blasters.). Steven has a 
    way of putting old fogies like myself into his shoes and make you 
    feel like you were actually there watching the film with him. This is 
    a great piece of writing. The issue ends with Steve Fenton and Tim 
    Paxton's Movie Checklist, where more information on the films 
    discussed in the issue are presented and who distributes them in case 
    you would like to purchase any of them. It's a useful guide which 
    every genre zine should have. Another great issue that is worth twice 
    the $5.95 price tag. <B>NOTE #10:</B> Issue #12, the last issue of 
    2014, is the (un)usual mixture of monster movies known and unknown 
    and is a great read from beginning to end. We begin with an in-depth 
    review of <B><A HREF="alligator_people_1959.htm">THE ALLIGATOR PEOPLE</A></B> 
    (1959), which also happens to be on the cover, by Dennis Capicik. 
    Very well-written. We then have another well-written (by Troy 
    Howarth) in-depth review of Tobe Hooper's <B><A HREF="lifeforce_1985.htm">LIFEFORCE</A></B> 
    (1985) and how the extended cut is the preferred version (I agree). I 
    think this film is very under-appreciated and Troy gives it the 
    respect it deserves. Then there are a series of reviews, both short 
    and long, of such monster films as Bert I. Gordon's chintzy giant 
    grasshopper film <B><A HREF="beginning_of_the_end_1957.htm">BEGINNING 
    OF THE END</A></B> (1957), <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Cellar Dweller">CELLAR
     DWELLER</A></B> (1988), the unbelievable Filipino fantasy film <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#BoyGod1983">THE
     BOY GOD</A></B> (1982), <B><A HREF="war_of_the_gargantuas_1966.htm">WAR
     OF THE GARGANTUAS</A></B> (1966), the stupifyingly bad Bigfoot flick <B><A HREF="in_search_of_bigfoot_1976_cry_wilderness_1986_dvd.htm">CRY
     WILDERNESS</A></B> (1986) and a negative review of <B><A HREF="abominable_2004.htm">ABOMINABLE</A></B> 
    (2004), which I couldn't disagree with more. Writer/Editor Tim Paxton 
    then gives us Part 7 of his look at India's infamous House Of Ramsay 
    and his writing and reviews of films I never heard of before only 
    makes me want to learn more (Tim is writing a reference book of 
    Indian genre films, which I can't wait for). Next-up is writer Adam 
    Parker-Edmondston's 12-page look at the weirder moments in zombie 
    films, mentioning dozens of zombie films both past and present, 
    including <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ShockWaves1976">SHOCK WAVES</A></B> 
    (1977), <B><A HREF="dead_hate_the_living_2000.htm">THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING</A></B> 
    (2000), <B><A HREF="zombeavers_2014.htm">ZOMBEAVERS</A></B> (2014) 
    and many more, some that you may have heard of and many you may not 
    have. It's a great article. Writer Steve Fenton then delves into the 
    life of 30's &amp; 40's Western movie star/professional movie gorilla 
    Ray &quot;Crash&quot; Corrigan, who also played the title creature in <B><A HREF="it_the_terror_from_beyond_space_1958.htm">IT!
     THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE</A></B> (1958; his last film). Steve 
    talks about Crash's life and times (he died in 1976 at the age of 74) 
    and the hopefully upcoming biopic of his career. It's my favorite 
    article in this 105-page issue. Louis Paul then writes reviews on 
    monster films where eye creatures were the main attraction, including 
    one of my favorite 50's horror films, <B><A HREF="crawling_eye_1958.htm">THE
     CRAWLING EYE</A></B> (1958). Another excellent job done by Louis. 
    Stephen R. Bissette then writes a 24-page article on the giant 
    monster film <B><A HREF="giant_behemoth_1959.htm">THE GIANT BEHEMOTH</A></B> 
    (1959) and makes a good argument on how this film was unfairly 
    maligned when it was originally released. There is so much 
    information in this article, it just might make you want to buy the 
    film (I already own it). The issue then closes out with the always 
    informative Movie Checklist (written by Steve Fenton &amp; Tim 
    Paxton), where we are given the availability and further comments of 
    every movie mentioned within the pages. If you want to ring-out 2014 
    in grand style, order this issue ASAP! A steal at $5.95. <B>NOTE #11:</B> 
    MONSTER! just keeps on getting better, which is why I continue to 
    show their new covers well into 2016. If you still havent ordered 
    this zine, go to Amazon and do a search for &quot;Tim Paxton&quot;. 
    It's the easiest way of finding this much-needed genre zine. I 
    believe Stephen R. Bissette's extensive two-part article (in Issues # 
    17 &amp; #18) about the search for a little-known film called <B>THE GLASSHEAD</B> 
    (1998) should win a Rhondo Award&#153; for best-researched article. 
    One of the best reads I have had in a long, long time. I'm a sucker 
    for stories about &quot;lost&quot; films (I'm still on a quest to 
    find a print of Charles Nizet's <B><A HREF="voodoo_heartbeat_1972.htm">VOODOO
     HEARTBEAT</A></B> [1972] for the past 30 years, which would make an 
    interesting story in itself) and Stephen hits this one out of the 
    park. I am now searching for an original VHS of this film. I'm not 
    holding my breath, though, since so few were made. I hope to see a 
    Rhondo on Stephen's mantle next year! If not, there is something 
    seriously wrong with their voting process. <B>NOTE #12:</B> The 
    special double issue, #28 &amp; #29 (April - May 2016) is an amazing 
    217 pages long and there is not one article in it that won't hold 
    your attention. Screw James Patterson's 150-page 
    &quot;Bookshots&quot;, this is what reading material should be. And 
    it will take you a full day to read it without stopping for bathroom 
    or meal breaks. Even the extra-large &quot;Movie Checklist&quot; is 
    more informative than most genre zines on the market. <B>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</B> 
    MONSTER! will now be published on a bi-monthly schedule beginning 
    with Issue 30 instead of a monthly schedule. While my heart sank a 
    little, it is totally reasonable when you factor in Tim Paxton's 
    hectic business schedule (he has an actual job and just doesn't 
    write, edit and do the layout for his zines)&nbsp; and, more 
    importantly (you have to know Tim to understand how important this 
    is), his family life. Waiting two months instead of one for an issue 
    is a small price to pay when you factor in all that criteria. <B>NOTE #13:</B> 
    Issue #31 is over 260 pages (it looks more like an oversized 
    paperback book than a zine) and their usual &quot;Monster 
    Checklist&quot; for this issue contains more information than one 
    issue of most professional horror zines! I particularly liked the 
    film reviews and history of Baltimore's late Don Dohler and 
    Baltimore-based actor George Stover (who appeared in nearly all of 
    Dohler's films as well as the films of John Waters.). Stover appeared 
    in one of my favorite Dohler films, <B><A HREF="blood_massacre_1988.htm">BLOOD
     MASSACRE</A></B> (1988), which turns out to have quite an 
    interesting production and criminal history. This was the film that 
    made Dohler give up filmmaking for over 10 years. Ah, the perils of 
    low-budget filmmaking. <B>NOTE #14:</B> Issue #32 is an amazing 361 
    pages long. You'll get cramps in your wrists and fingers if you try 
    to read this issue in one sitting. <B>HORRIBLE NEWS:</B> Tim Paxton's 
    sister Heather, who suffered from physical and emotional problems and 
    spent her life in a wheelchair, passed away on June 10 2017. My 
    condolences to Tim (who loved his sister like no other brother ever 
    could) and his family for their awful loss.<B> NOTE #15:</B> After 
    waiting nearly a year, Issue #33 drops and it is an amazing 369 
    pages. I'm in the middle of reading it now. Full review when I gain 
    my sight back!</FONT></FONT><BR>

     <A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm">GOREZONE</A></B> - FANGORIA 
    editor Chris Alexander has revived the long-dead horror zine and made 
    it a full-color glossy zine. The zine is not available by newstand,

     Alexander has numbered the issue to correspond with the last issue 
    in the 90's and the zine does a good job covering the independent 
    horror scene, as well as retrospective articles on gore films of the 
    past (issue #30 deals with the cannibal films of Umberto Lenzi like <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Sacrifice!1972">MAN

    has a sexy photoshoot and centerfold with actress Danielle Harris

    opinion), a cover story on the <B><A HREF="guinea_pig_3_1986.htm">GUINEA

    the New Millennium, <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeadlyEnd">DEADLY END</A></B>

    is very little gore on view.<B> NOTE #2:</B> Issue #32 is a marked 
    improvement over the issue before it, thanks to more bloody photos

     OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="night_of_the_zombies_1983.htm">NIGHT

    ripped-off by the sand monster; now this is what GOREZONE should be

    effort, <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#LostEmpire1983">THE LOST EMPIRE</A></B>,
     finally made its appearance on DVD; an unneeded article about 
    Misfits member Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein (once again proving 
    that editor Chris Alexander can't help but show his music roots in 
    magazines that have no place for music unless it is about horror 
    soundtracks); a look at the troubled production history of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Spookies">SPOOKIES</A></B> 
    (probably the best article in this issue); the second part of a 
    multi-part article on Jess Franco (it is better than Ambien if you 
    are not a fan of this director, of which you can count me in on); and 
    a couple of other articles to fill up space. I still think charging 
    $11.99 for a 52 page full color zine is a might steep, but there is 
    some interesting things to be found within the pages and this time 
    the photos are getting gorier, which finally lets the zine live up to 
    its name. <B>NOTE 3#:</B> Issue #33 (the last issue of 2014) is 
    exceptional in two ways: First, it has a lengthy and well-written (by 
    John Torrani) article on the &quot;Death Tapes&quot; that were 
    released in the 80's &amp; 90's, thanks to the success of the first <B><A HREF="faces_of_death_1978.htm">FACES
     OF DEATH</A></B> (1978), but since <B>FOD</B> was eventually exposed 
    to have more faked footage than actual death footage, it really 
    doesn't count as a &quot;Death Tape&quot;. The article is 
    well-researched and full of rare VHS scans (including the simply 
    horrible <B><A HREF="death_in_focus_1989.htm">DEATH IN FOCUS</A></B> 
    - 1989) and Torrani declares the <B><A HREF="traces_of_death_1993.htm">TRACES
     OF DEATH</A></B> series (1993 - 2000) the best Death Tapes in a 
    crowded field because all of the footage was real (I concur). The 
    second thing is the article on Wes Craven and his involvement in 
    pornography during the 70's. The article (written by Joseph 
    Maddrey&nbsp; and excerpted from his book &quot;<I>Beyond Fear</I>&quot;)
     makes a strong case that Craven directed (there's no doubt he 
    starred in it, but didn't perfom in the sex scenes) the 1975 porn 
    film <B><A HREF="fireworks_woman_1975.htm">THE FIREWORKS WOMAN</A></B>,
     using the pseudonym &quot;Abe Snake&quot;. Even though Craven 
    refuses to acknowledge that he directed it (but he hinted at it in 
    interviews throughout his career), Maddrey offers too much proof to 
    the contrary to doubt that Craven did direct it. Great article that 
    makes me want to buy his book. There is also an article on whether 
    the torture film <B><A HREF="men_behind_the_sun_1988.htm">MEN BEHIND 
    THE SUN</A></B> (1988) is educational or exploitation; a short 
    interview with director James Cullen Bressack (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MyPureJoy2011">MY
     PURE JOY</A></B> - 2011; <B><A HREF="to_jennifer_2013.htm">TO JENNIFER</A></B>

    of the long-forgotten horror film <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#RedVelvet2009">RED
     VELVET</A></B> (2009); another interview with a little-known scream 
    queen (in this case it is Chanel Ryan); and yet another interview 
    with a heavy metal music artist, this time Anthrax's guitarist Scott 
    Ian. Gorezone is finally starting to live up to its name again. <B>NOTE

    was tired of seeing wasted pages of this thin zine being devoted to

    chronological date? I sure as hell don't. I'll buy a music zine if I 
    want to know or look it up on WikiPedia., which I am sure the writer 
    of this article did. It has no place in a zine called GOREZONE. Chris 
    Alexander should start his own music rag if he wants to cover the 
    Heavy/Death Metal scene. <B>NOTE #5:</B> With the departure of Editor 
    Chris Alexander in late 2015 and the downfall of FANGORIA as a print 
    zine (it is available as a digital download only in the .pdf format,

    form. Do not count on it, since he owes writers thousands of 
    dollars), it looks like GOREZONE is dead again after Issue #35. Hey,

    first issue. So much for the sophomore slump. <B>NOTE #2:</B> Issue 
    #3 is a thin 50 pages long with lots of advertising, but there are 
    some informative articles and interviews. First up: A retrospective 
    on the original <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">TEXAS

    and how they lost Band hundreds of thousands of dollars (most stores

    two, except for the Tobe Hooper and Dave Parker interviews, which 
    makes me believe that this issue was turned out rather quickly and 
    without much thought. So far, it is the worst of the issues released. <B>NOTE
     #3:</B> Issue #4 (which should be called the All-Interview Issue) is 
    a marked improvement of the previous issue and contains a great 
    interview with Lisa Petrucci, wife of the late Mike Vraney, who 
    founded Something Weird Video in 1990 and how she is going to keep 
    the label alive (that is great news for fans of<A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/delirium issue 7 may-june 2015 front cover small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="218" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
    the label, which includes me). We then have an interview with 
    director Frank Henenlotter, who was instrumental in helping Vraney 
    get a deal with Image Entertainment (even if they had to make trims 
    to films that Image deemed &quot;hardcore&quot;) and had his own line 
    of films on Something Weird Video (&quot;Frank Henenlotter's Sexy 
    Shockers&quot;, which included one of my all-time favorite films <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Satan's Children">SATAN'S
     CHILDREN</A></B> - 1974). Then there are one page interviews with 
    Herschell Gordon Lewis and Jimmyo Burril (<B><A HREF="chainsaw_sally_season_one_dvd.htm">THE
     CHAINSAW SALLY SHOW</A></B>). There is also a longer interview with 
    Fred Olen Ray about his film <B><A HREF="sideshow_2000.htm">SIDESHOW</A></B> 
    (2000). An interview with Spanish director Victor Matellano and his 
    new film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wax2014">WAX</A></B>. A nice 
    interview with Full Moon regular Tim Thomerson and a nifty German VHS 
    centerfold of <B><A HREF="trancers_1985.htm">TRANCERS</A></B> (1985). 
    We then have an interview with John Lechago and how his good 
    ultra-low-budget film <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Blood Gnome">BLOOD
     GNOME</A></B> (2003) led to him directing a series of <B><A HREF="killjoy_series_2000-2012.htm">KILLJOY</A></B> 
    films for Charles Band and Full Moon. We then have a pretty decent 
    interview with Skinny Puppy musician-turned-actor Nivek Ogre, who 
    starred in such films as <B><A HREF="repo_the_genetic_opera_2008.htm">REPO:
     THE GENETIC OPERA</A></B> (2008) <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#a2001ManiacsScreams">2001

     PARK</A></B> (2012). Also in the issue are interviews with director 
    Mick Garris; new director (and wife of great director Neil Marshall) 
    Axelle Carolyn; director Chuck Russell of <B><A HREF="blob_1988.htm">THE
     BLOB</A></B> remake (1988) and his great horror film career in the 
    80's; and non-interview pieces, including a review of Vampira book, 
    VAMPIRA: DARK GODDESS OF HORROR, by author W. Scott Poole and Part 
    One on the History of Horror Comics. Missing is Part 2 of William 
    Shatner's interview of Stan Lee, but that was the most useless 
    article in the previous issue. Not bad for a fourth issue and better 
    than most they have turned out so far, thanks to some rare photos and 
    ads, all in color. <B>NOTE #4:</B> Issue #5 (the final issue of 2014) 
    is probably the best issue yet because it deals with zombie and 
    cannibal films of the past. The first article is with director Ken 
    Wiederhorn, who directed what some consider the first Nazi zombie 
    horror film, <B><A HREF="shock_waves_1976b.htm">SHOCK WAVES</A></B> 
    (1977), and the interview (by Fangoria and Gorezone editor Chris 
    Alexander) is informative and full of great photos, posters and ad 
    mats. Chris then writes the next article about two terrible Nazi 
    zombie films, <B><A HREF="zombie_lake_1980.htm">ZOMBIE LAKE</A></B> 
    (1981) and <B><A HREF="oasis_of_the_zombies_1981.htm">OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES</A></B> 
    (1982), both originally released on big box VHS by Charles Band's 
    company Wizard Video and which one is worse (<B>OASIS</B> wins by a 
    hair). We then move on to a rare interview with actress Me Me Lai, 
    who starred in the first Italian cannibal film, director Umberto 
    Lenzi's <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Sacrifice!1972">MAN FROM DEEP RIVER</A></B> 
    (1972), and starred in a few more cannibal films (Ruggero Deodato's <B><A HREF="jungle_holocaust_1976.htm">JUNGLE
     HOLOCAUST</A></B> - 1977; Lenzi's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EatenAlive1980">THE
     EMERALD JUNGLE</A></B> - 1980) and other movies before retiring from 
    acting in 1984. This is her first published interview since her 
    retirement and is therefore a must-read for Italian cannibal film 
    enthusiasts. We then have a short one page review of two of late 
    director Bruno Mattei's latter-day cannibal flicks: <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CannibalHoloBegin">CANNIBAL
     HOLOCAUST: THE BEGINNING</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="mondo_cannibal_2003.htm">MONDO

     THE LAND OF THE CANNIBALS</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="land_of_death_2003.htm">LAND
     OF DEATH</A></B> - 2003), both recently released on no-frills DVDs 
    by InterVision Picture Corp.. Believe me, they don't deserve more 
    than one page. We then move on to a short two-page interview with 
    Zach Galligan about his work on <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Waxwork 2">WAXWORK
     II: LOST IN TIME</A></B> (1991) and a nice French centerfold poster 
    of <B>OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES</B>. David Jay then does a nice three page 
    write-up about the creation of Stuart Gordon's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Castle Freak">CASTLE
     FREAK</A></B> (1995) and offers a lot of tidbits of information you 
    may not know about it, including some words from Gordon himself and 
    some photos and artwork you may never have seen before (including a 
    graphic full-frontal photo of the Freak himself). There is much more 
    on view here, including an interview with Jeff Burr and the creation 
    of the horror anthology <B><A HREF="offspring_1987.htm">THE OFFSPRING</A></B> 
    (1987), the joining of Tom Holland and Tim Sullivan to form <A HREF="tnt_presents_ad_2014.htm">TNT

     MANIACS: FIELD OF SCREAMS</A></B> - 2010), a look at the films of 
    Andy and Arlene Sidaris, Part Two of A Brief History Of Horror Comics 
    (very informative) and reviews of Blu-rays and DVDs from around the 
    world. Charles Band also makes an important (and welcomed) <A HREF="charles_band_announcement_2014.htm">announcement</A> 
    on the final page (&copy;2014 Delirium Magazine). This zine keeps 
    getting better, but my only complaint is that some of the articles 
    are way too short and need to be elaborated on more. All in all, 
    still an above average issue. <B>NOTE #5:</B> Still reading this zine 
    in 2015 and it keeps on getting better and better.<B> NOTE #6:</B>

    Although it is only the last week of March 2014 as I write this, I

    will turn out a better book than this huge, 800-page monster (written 
    by John Szpunar) that deals with all manner of horror zines from the 
    beginning till now (only Tim Paxton gets a mention in this book 
    because the zines I mention above are brand new, but Tim has been 
    publishing zines for a long time). If you are looking for my zine, 
    CRITICAL CONDITION, in this book, you will be disappointed because my 
    subscription base was smaller than 500, but don't let that turn you 
    off from buying this hefty book. Filled with interviews of the 
    founding fathers of amateur and pro-zines (including the late, great 
    Andy Copp), all who tell very interesting stories about the trials 
    and tribulations of keeping a zine up and running. Since the book, 
    which is digest size, but humongous, weighs a lot, expect some 
    handstrain, but it is worth it, since some of the stories will keep 
    you captivated and for people like myself that published a zine, can 
    identify with. You will not be able to read this giant tome in one 
    day (I'm still reading it after three days of three hours each day), 
    but you will enjoy every minute. Let me make this absolutely clear: 
    You don't have to do anything with creating a zine to enjoy this 
    book. The stories are entertaining, some of the covers reproduced 
    inside brought a rush of nostalgia and readers of zines throughout 
    the decades will dig this book. From Headpress Books and available 
    online on Amazon. My highest recommendation.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Are you like me and love movies that deal with the post-apocalypse or 
    any film that deals with the impending doom of a post-nuke future? 
    Then you are going to love author David J. Moore's comprehensive, 
    large 435-page book that lists all these<A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm#Books"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/world gone wild book cover small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    films in alphabetical order and has interviews with the people who 
    made them. What I like about this book, besides the rare full color 
    photos, posters, VHS and DVD covers that fill this book up (not a 
    black &amp; white photo to be found on any of the pages), is that 
    there are films within these pages that I never heard of and I 
    consider myself a connoisseur of this genre of film (I review dozens 
    of them on this site, my favorite being the Italian ones). It is 
    apparent David J. Moore is an expert in this genre and fills the 
    pages with information and interviews that you have never read before 
    and you actually learn something about why this genre of film is so 
    popular (but not as popular as it should be, in my opinion.). Mr. 
    Moore had a terrific turnout for his book signing&nbsp; in Burbank, 
    California on the book's debut and he sold every copy (and had some 
    damn good guests that showed up to support him, including Steve 
    Barkett, the director/actor of one of my favorite U.S. post-apocalyptic
     films, <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Aftermath 1980">THE AFTERMATH</A></B> 
    - 1978 and he even has an interview in the book), This is bound to go 
    out of print very fast (I don't know if Moore has a deal with 
    Schiffer Publishing Ltd. for a second printing), so pony-up the 
    hardcover book's $34.99 price (even less if you are an Amazon Prime 
    member) and be prepared to spend a few days learning about this 
    particular sub-genre of the science fiction film. The book is as up 
    to date as it can be, covering films up to the year 2013, so drop 
    what you are doing, log on to your computer and order this excellent 
    tome of films that describe what mankind could be like if nuclear 
    war, disease, nature gone amok, germ warfare or any other disaster 
    turns our planet into one where only the strongest survive. Essential 
    reading for fans of these kind of films and very well written. I tip 
    my hat to David J. Moore.</FONT></FONT><BR>

     <A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm#Books">BRITISH CULT CINEMA: THE 
    AMICUS ANTHOLOGY</A> -</B> For those of you that think British horror 
    only consisted of Hammer films, author Bruce G. Hallenbeck (a 
    frequent contributor to the Hammer Films professional fanzine <B><A HREF="little_shoppe_of_horrors_magazine.htm">LITTLE
     SHOPPE OF HORRORS</A></B>) is here to remind you that there were 
    other British production companies turning out excellent horror films 
    during the 60's &amp; 70's. Although Amicus was known for making all 
    kinds of horror films, Hallenbeck wisely sticks to the anthology 
    films that Amicus turned out from the mid-60's to the mid-70's. 
    Starting with a foreward from Amicus anthology director Kevin Connor 
    and then a prologue that tells the story about<A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm#Books"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/amicus anthology book cover small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="217" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    how anthology films started (back to 1919!) and listing and 
    explaining the plots of various anthology films from the 20's to the 
    60's (and it's a great read full of info you never read before as 
    well as being profusely illustrated with stills and posters of the 
    films), Hallenbeck gets down to Amicus anthology business, starting 
    with their first anthology <B><A HREF="dr_terrors_house_of_horrors_1965.htm">DR.
     TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS</A></B> (1964), not only explaining the 
    film, but describing how Max J. Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky came to 
    come together and form Amicus Productions (&quot;Amicus&quot; is 
    Latin for &quot;friend&quot;) and how their <B>CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD</B> 
    (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="horror_hotel_1960.htm">HORROR HOTEL</A></B> - 
    1960), although listed as a &quot;Vulcan Production&quot; is actually 
    the first Amicus Production. Hallenbeck then goes into detail about 
    casting and shooting <B>DR. T</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">E</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>RROR'S</B> 
    (including pages from the actual script), giving the reader 
    information not available to them before, as well as each episode's 
    plot synopsis. Hallenbeck does the same thing for the rest of the 
    Amicus anthologies: <B><A HREF="torture_garden_1967.htm">TORTURE GARDEN</A></B> 
    (1967); <B><A HREF="house_that_dripped_blood_1971.htm">THE HOUSE THAT 
    DRIPPED BLOOD</A></B> (1971); <B><A HREF="tales_from_the_crypt_1972.htm">TALES
     FROM THE CRYPT</A></B> (1972); <B><A HREF="asylum_1973.htm">ASYLUM</A></B> 
    (1972); <B><A HREF="vault_of_horror_1973.htm">THE VAULT OF HORROR</A></B> 
    (1973) and <B><A HREF="from_beyond_the_grave_1975.htm">FROM BEYOND 
    THE GRAVE</A></B> (1975), giving us plenty of black &amp; white 
    photos, ad mats, photos and other paraphenalia (with a center section 
    of the film's posters and photos in color) to please both the reader 
    and those who just like to look at photos they have never seen 
    before. Along the way, Hallenbeck describes the trials and 
    tribulations that Rosenberg and Subotsky had to go through to get 
    their films made and there are anecdotes about other films in the 
    Amicus canon. Hallenbeck closes the book with a look at anthology 
    films after Amicus from around the world and how a small British 
    company changed the course of the horror film. Besides a few mistakes 
    made by publisher Hemlock Books (none of it has to do with Bruce 
    Hallenbeck's excellent writing) regarding wrong headers and missing 
    icons on pages (it's really not that distracting and only anal people 
    like me will notice), this is the book you want to read if you love 
    British horror films other than those put out by Hammer Films. My 
    hope is that Hallenbeck takes on other British horror production 
    companies like Tigon British Film Productions and Tyburn Films, along 
    with the non-anthology films of Amicus. I would be a truly happy man. 
    Great job, Bruce!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    HISTORY OF CANADIAN HORROR CINEMA</A> -</B> Author Caelum Vatnsdal 
    updated his ten year-old book of everything that is Canadian horror 
    (filmwise) and I have to say, since I am a fan of Canadian films in 
    general (not just horror,<A HREF="horror_magazines_2014.htm#Books"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/they came from within book front cover small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    but action and martial arts films as well), this is the book you want 
    if you love Canadian horror films, right up to the year 2014 (There's 
    a poster for Astron 6's <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#Editor2014">THE
     EDITOR</A></B> - 2014 [they also did the extremely graphic and funny <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FathersDay2011">FATHER'S

    - 2011] in the book's copious color center section, a film that I 
    have been dying too see since I heard about it about a week 
    previously). Mr. Vatnsdal breaks down the Canadian horror film 
    industry (first starting with a Foreward by David DeCoteau, which was 
    written for the first edition) from the beginning right up to the 
    present and covers the book in rare photos rather than the usual 
    posters and ad mats (The center section is reserved for most of the 
    color posters) and it's an interesting and entertaining read from 
    beginning to end. Since I never owned the original edition (which 
    only covered films up to the year 2004), this was like a history 
    lesson for me, especially the way Canadians were ashamed of their tax 
    shelter horror films of the late 70's &amp; 80's; most of the films 
    that I happen to love. What I particularly love about this book is 
    that it not only talks about the films, but the people themselves, 
    from the directors, producers, screenwriters, special effects teams, 
    film financiers and other people at length, so you not only get to 
    know the films, but a history of the people who made them. So if you 
    like a history of Canadian horror films, dating back to the 1910's to 
    1961's 3D extravaganza <B><A HREF="mask_1961.htm">THE MASK</A></B>, 
    right up until 2014's <B><A HREF="wolfcop_2014.htm">WOLFCOP</A></B>, 
    this is the book for you. There's an appendix at the back of the book 
    that lists all the films in alphabetical order with their complete 
    credits, so this book is a must for Canadian horror film junkies like 
    myself. I know there are a lot of you out there who feel the same way 
    as I do, which is why I was able to score the final copy that was 
    available on Amazon at the time. I hope they get more because this is 
    a great primer on learning about the creation of Canadian horror 
    films. I've seen a couple of other books and websites that deal with 
    this subject, but believe me, this is the book you want if you need 
    to know the complete history.</FONT></FONT></P>

     <A HREF="grindhouse_purgatory_issue_2_2014.htm">GRINDHOUSE PURGATORY</A></B> 
    - Publisher and Editor-In-Chief 42nd Street Pete (a.k.a. Pete 
    Chiarella) is one of the angriest zine publishers today. Right off 
    the bat, on Issue #2 of this black &amp; white zine of everything 
    Grindhouse, he states on the cover you &quot;Must be <A HREF="grindhouse_purgatory_issue_2_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/grindhouse purgatory issue 2 cover small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>OVER
     18 to purchase AND you must be able to actually READ!!&quot;. Yeah, 
    that will get people to buy your zine. Pete doesn't really care, 
    though, because inside the covers is some of the worst bile spilled 
    from a person's mouth, mixed in with reviews of grind house films of 
    the 70's &amp; 80's. While some may enjoy Pete's style of writing (he 
    also has guest writers who do a much better job), he just can't let 
    go of things that happened in his past and uses this zine as an 
    outlet to get revenge on those people he believes have wronged him. 
    (One example: &quot;Mainstream horror mags suck a huge AIDS-infested 
    cock.&quot; and then goes on to praise SHOCK CINEMA. And then there's 
    another article in the zine written by Pete called &quot;FULL MOON 
    FEVER Or: Getting Fucked By Chuck&quot;). While some of the other 
    articles written by other writers are interesting (even though I 
    strongly disagree with author Annie Riordan's list of recent lousy 
    remakes), there's an air of hostility that runs through the zine's 64 
    pages. Pete says this may be the last issue because all the money 
    comes out of his own pocket (yeah, right!) and I hope he's right, 
    because the horror world doesn't need this much negativity in its 
    life. I think it's time for 42nd Pete to retire and leave the new 
    zines to the people who can write a story without attacking someone's 
    personal life. That went out with Rick Sullivan's GORE GAZETTE in the 
    80's. You know not much thought went into making this zine when he 
    states on the Contents Page, &quot;No part of this publication can be 
    duplicated in any way without permission of the publisher. Except for 
    the photos. The pictures we already stole. Knock yourself out.&quot; 
    and then doesn't give credit where he stole the photos from (although 
    some seem very familiar to me). The last pages in this issue is 
    Pete's story on massage parlors from the late-60's until the 80's in 
    New York City. What a way for a perfect unhappy ending. Not 
    recommended unless you like to read an angry person complain about 
    his life and the lives (and deaths) of others. I have better things 
    to do with my life. Issues 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 are available from Amazon 
    if you like the masochistic lifestyle. <B>NOTE:</B> I have been 
    hearing that Pete is pissed off at me for naming his zine the 
    Angriest Horror Zine Of 2014. All I can say is a lot of people like 
    this style of writing and any publicity is good publicity. I have 
    Issue #3 on its way (a postal mixup has delayed its delivery), but I 
    will read it and then decide if this goes from Angry to one of the 
    top zines of 2014. I can only base things on what I read and these 
    are my picks and opinions, no one else's. I don't take anything Pete 
    says against me personally and he shouldn't take anything I say about 
    him and his zine personally, either. When it comes down to brass 
    tacks, Pete is doing what he loves and is getting free publicity. He 
    may not like the kind of publicity it is, but I know plenty of people 
    who will buy it based on this review. OK, I have read Issue #3<A HREF="grindhouse_purgatory_issue_2_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/grindhouse purgatory issue 3 cover small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    and my opinion hasn't changed. Pete still holds grudges against the 
    big horror zine (especially Chris Alexander and FANGORIA) and has a 
    fake and rather insulting interview with Michael Gingold (here called 
    &quot;Michael Whinegold&quot;). Pete has proven he can write well 
    with his heartfelt goodbyes to Michael Vraney and Al Goldstein (both 
    in Issue #3), but he is so goddamn angry about almost everything 
    else, he makes it very difficult to take him seriously. While the 
    entire layout of the zine is vanilla and undistinguishable, there are 
    some good articles by Josh Hadley and Pete about reliving the days 
    when VHS tape ruled the world and a trip down memory lane by Pete 
    about East Coast Wrestling (many bouts which took places at venues 
    near where I lived). There are also some porn articles and an 
    interview with porn star Serena and a cover story about the Italian 
    cannibal genre. GRINDHOUSE PURGATORY is improving, but it needs a 
    better layout and less venom in the writing. Then it will be a zine 
    to contend with. <B>NOTE #2:</B> It looks like 42nd Street Pete has 
    released Issue #4 (a review will be forthcoming after I receive it.) 
    after a long delay and I hear he has a lot of bad things to say about 
    me. Of course he will blame everyone but himself, but the layout and 
    bile-filled writing are the real culprits. I gave him three chances 
    to make the zine worthwhile to readers, but calling people names and 
    making up fake interviews are not what the people want. They want to 
    be informed, not inflamed. I can't wait to read what he has to say 
    about me. I take his insults as a badge of honor. Well, I have read 
    Issue #4 and I can say Pete is still being Pete. After heartfelt 
    obits to James Garner and Eli Wallach, he delivers a two page 
    editorial where he rips me a new asshole (without mentioning my name, 
    of course, because he knows he can be sued), saying that I have some 
    kind of agenda against him (I don't) and then goes as far to mention 
    that incident where someone faked my death on Facebook, saying that I 
    did it myself (And also calling me a woman-hating, closeted 
    homosexual who has a man-crush on him! I laughed so hard, I think 
    some pee leaked out!). If this came from some coherent and halfway 
    sane person, I would be angry, but since it came from Pete Chiarella 
    (oh, excuse me, 42nd Street Pete, because every schizophrenic has to 
    have an alias), all I could do was laugh, imagining him drooling at 
    the mouth and snot coming out of his nose while he was typing his 
    bile against me. Pete said that he will never change his style of 
    hateful writing, which is why I have named this the Angriest Zine of 
    2014. He says that my trashing his zine (I gave it three out of five 
    stars on Amazon, but I guess he thinks that is too low) has actually 
    increased his readership (something that I said would probably 
    happen) and that I have to actually buy an issue to review it (Well 
    of course I do; I don't take anything for free because I have 
    standards. This way I can speak my mind freely because I spent my own 
    money. Christ, I don't even accept movie screeners for this website!) 
    The issue looks like every other one: badly laid-out one column 
    articles with plenty of empty white space, but this time with some 
    good guest writers like actor/stuntman Gary Kent (who probably wrote 
    the article to get a free full page plug for his excellent 
    autobiography and other films/<A HREF="grindhouse_purgatory_issue_2_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/grindhouse purgatory issue 4 2014 front cover small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="217" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>books

    located in Cleveland, Ohio; writer Robert Morgan does a piece on the 
    sadly neglected 70's trucker movie <B><A HREF="white_line_fever_1975.htm">WHITE
     LINE FEVER</A></B> (1975), starring Jan Michael Vincent; author John 
    Shatzer does an article on giant bug movies of the 50's and another 
    article on why the Internet sucks (it's actually a very interesting 
    take in the subject on how people lost personal connections with each 
    other); writer Josh Hadley does a great article on how print zines 
    will always be better than their digital counterparts (and I couldn't 
    agree more); Bill Adcock does an article on the Bigfoot softcore sex 
    film <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Beauties Beast">THE BEAUTIES AND 
    THE BEAST</A></B> (1973); Dave Kosanke does an article on the porn 
    features of star Amber Lynn and director Bruce Seven. But the 
    majority of articles are written by Chiarella himself (I also 
    believes he uses the name &quot;Dr. Rhonda Baughman&quot; here, since 
    I have never heard of &quot;her&quot; before, although I could be 
    wrong), as he does articles on the Western <B><A HREF="sabata_1969.htm">SABATA</A></B> 
    (1969); a look back at the long abandoned tradition of double 
    features at movie theaters; a retrospective on the biker films of the 
    60's &amp; early-70's and how they saved the indy genre (his best 
    article in this 112 page zine); a short article at the almost 
    forgotten film <B><A HREF="corrupt_ones_1967.htm">THE CORRUPT ONES</A></B> 
    (1967); a piece on the film <B><A HREF="snuff_1971-1976_dvd2.htm">SNUFF</A></B> 
    (1971/1976) and the furor it caused when it was released; a look back 
    on murdered wrestler Frank &quot;Bruiser&quot; Brody; and 
    articles/interviews by &quot;Dr. Rhonda Baughman&quot; (whose writing 
    style closely resembles Pete's) on <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Savage Streets">SAVAGE
     STREETS</A></B> (1984) star Johnny Venokur; 2014 interviews with 
    80's Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Michelle Bauer, 
    who have done a new movie together with director David DeCoteau; and 
    an interview with actor Ken Abraham (look him up on IMDb). On the 
    positive side, there are no fake interviews (which Pete says in his 
    editorial upsets me because I read FANGORIA!), the writing is a 
    little sharper and the zine more varied in its subjects. Hey, Pete: 
    You take things much too personally and you have to get used to 
    people not agreeing with you 100% of the time. That's the way of the 
    world. Get use to it. You still are angry, but insulting me is like a 
    badge of honor. And it helped your readership grow. You should be 
    thanking me instead of spreading lies about me. Oh, well, you can't 
    teach an old dog new tricks. And also Pete: My website, called 
    Critical Condition (www.critcononline.com) has been on the Internet 
    since 1999 and before that in zine form since 1982. I probably get 
    more readers in one day on my site than all four of your issues have 
    been read by different people. And it's not a $2.00 website. It takes 
    a lot of work and money to keep it looking old school, but my guess 
    is that you wouldn't know how to even begin to create your own 
    website (And not a blog, Anyone can have a blog.). It actually takes 
    work to keep it updated and relevant. I not only live in the past, I 
    also live in the here and now.<B> NOTE #3:</B> <A HREF="grindhouse_purgatory_issue_2_2014.htm">Issue
     #5</A> arrived in April 2015 and hardly anything has changed. The 
    layout is still the same vanilla one column pages with plenty of 
    white space (with a noticeable mistake on one page where a photo 
    slipped into the type, making the last line unreadable), but Pete 
    muffles most of his vitriol except when it comes to horror 
    conventions (he thinks they are shitty today) and how he and his 
    profile were deleted by Facebook for complaining about conventions 
    (Yeah, that HAS to be the reason!). Some good articles, though. 
    Proceed at your own risk, but at least I buy every issue that I read, 
    so I am supporting Pete's zine. <B>Note #4:</B> August 4, 2016:&nbsp; 
    Pete is still churning out his zine, but I can no longer support 
    articles written where the information is taken from Wikipedia and 
    the IMDb.</FONT></FONT></P>

     thoughts on the 2014 - 2015 TV season. All times are Eastern 
    Standard Time (EST). First up: Fox's <B><A HREF="gotham_tv_series_2014.htm">GOTHAM</A></B> 
    (Mondays 8:00pm). Marvel has had much success in movies and on TV <A HREF="gotham_tv_series_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/gotham 2014 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>showing
     the origins of their characters, so DC Comics tries the same thing 
    with this series (DC Comics is also premiering a reboot of their 90's 
    series <B><A HREF="flash_tv_series_2014.htm">THE FLASH</A></B> on 
    Tuesdays at 8:00pm on the CW Network [which I have no interest in 
    watching], that premieres a day before DC's <B><A HREF="arrow_tv_series_2012.htm">ARROW</A></B>,
     which has been on-air since 2012 and since The Flash and Arrow live 
    in the same superhero &quot;universe&quot;, there was a <A HREF="flash_arrow_crossover_episode_2014.htm">crossover
     episode</A> that aired on December 2 &amp; 3, 2014), which has a 
    nice 70's look, but otherwise is mainly a dud. It shows the 
    beginnings of Commissioner Gordon when he was Detective James Gordon 
    (Ben McKenzie, who seems miscast for the role) and his partner 
    Detective Harvey Bullock (the always interesting Donal Logue) as they 
    investigate the death of a young Bruce Wayne's (David Mazouz) 
    parents. The pilot episode also introduces us to Selina Kyle (Camren 
    Bicondova), soon to become the Catwoman, who also witnesses the 
    murder of Bruce Wayne's parents; Lord Alfred Pennyworth (Sean 
    Pertwee), young Bruce Wayne's butler and friend; Oswald Cobblepot 
    (Robin Lord Taylor), who would eventually become The Penguin; Edward 
    Nygma (Cory Michael Smith), who we all know who will become by his 
    name; and original characters, such as crime kingpin Fish Mooney 
    (Jada Pinkett Smith, who announced she will not come back for a 
    Season 2); Captain Sarah Essen (Zabryna Guevara), Gordon's superior; 
    and Barbara Kean (Erin Richards), Gordon's love interest. This may 
    all sound inviting, but the scripting and plotting is poor and you 
    could create a drinking game in the pilot by how many times someones 
    says &quot;James Gordon&quot;. I hope the series gets better, but 
    they need stronger writing and more original thinking to pull this 
    off for a complete season. It's pretty to look at, but you can only 
    look at something pretty for so long until you become bored. <B>NOTE:</B> 
    The second episode was a major improvement, but it still has a long 
    way to go if it wants me to be a regular watcher. The sub-stories 
    kill this series, but the main story, about Selina Kyle, was 
    interesting and well-written. I'll give it a couple more episodes to 
    find its groove. It dropped nearly one million viewers from the first 
    episode, which is not sitting well with Fox (They would have liked 
    higher numbers since it precedes last year's hit <B><A HREF="sleepy_hollow_tv_series_2013.htm">SLEEPY
     HOLLOW</A></B>, which has so far gotten a little over 5 million 
    viewers for its first two episodes, Definitely not the same audience 
    numbers as last year, but the show is still a corker.). The premiere 
    episode attracted 8.2 million viewers and the second episode got 7.4 
    million viewers, so Fox is worried, but will give the show a chance 
    to grow in this time period (It has failed to make it into the Top 25 
    TV Shows of the week, but ratings are steadily growing thanks to word 
    of mouth, mainly because of Taylor's chilling portrayal of the 
    villain that will eventually be known as The Penguin and Fox has 
    ordered a full season of episodes. It has also been renewed for a 
    Second Season.). <B>*</B> CBS' <B><A HREF="scorpion_tv_series_2014.htm">SCORPION</A></B> 
    (Mondays 9:00pm) had technophiles up in arms right out of the gate, 
    just from the<A HREF="scorpion_tv_series_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/scorpion 2014 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="294" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    first episode alone, because of its unreal depiction of computer 
    hacking, but they seem to forget this is just a TV series and a 
    rather entertaining one at that. A rather eccentric Black Ops Agent 
    (the always appealing Robert Patrick) assembles a crew of four tech 
    and math-savy geniuses (their combined IQ is over 700), who are 
    wasting their lives (and forget to pay their bills), and forms a team 
    to fight modern technical crimes, like in the opener, where someone 
    hacks the entire LAX airline landing schedule, where over 54 planes 
    will crash unless the virus inside the air traffic controller 
    software is wiped-out. The show is funny, tense and, yes, 
    unbelievable in its depiction of the way hacking works, but as far as 
    entertainment value goes, this is top-notch (there's a sub-plot about 
    an autistic boy genius and his cute waitress mother [Katharine 
    McPhee], who works in a cafe where the group have to make their 
    headquarters to fix the airline problem that, in the finale, becomes 
    a major plot point). It easily won the ratings war against last 
    year's breakout hit <B><A HREF="sleepy_hollow_tv_series_2013.htm">SLEEPY
     HOLLOW</A></B>, so look for that show to find a different time slot 
    (I like them both, so I am very conflicted) or for Fox to hope that 
    the new show will lower in the ratings department. It has already has 
    hackers up in arms, so it may have less of an audience than the first 
    episode, but I predict it will remain strong among younger viewers. 
    It not only has technical mumbo-jumbo and nerd humor, but also an 
    emotional core usually not found in a procedural show. I hope it 
    keeps that aspect flowing freely (<B>NOTE:</B> The second episode 
    attracted 13.3 million live viewers, only very slightly down from the 
    first episode [13.8 million live viewers], so this is considered a 
    qualified hit. <B>NOTE #2:</B> <B><A HREF="ncis_los_angeles_tv_series_2009.htm">NCIS:
     LOS ANGELES</A></B> and <B>SCORPION</B> had a crossover episode, 
    which means they exist in the same TV universe. And CBS has ordered a 
    full seasons of episodes and renewed it for a second season.) <B>*</B> 
    CBS' <B><A HREF="ncis_new_orleans_tv_series_2014.htm">NCIS: NEW ORLEANS</A></B>

    [1995 - 2005]) and has the coveted spot to run right after the #1 
    rated scripted drama on TV (<B><A HREF="ncis_los_angeles_tv_series_2009.htm">NCIS:

    always intriguing <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE BLACKLIST</A></B> 
    which, to me, is a boneheaded move. <B>NOTE:</B> It seems I was 
    right. The <B>NCIS</B> spin-off got the worst ratings in its six 
    season career.), which will guarantee it success at least for a 
    little while. The <A HREF="ncis_new_orleans_tv_series_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ncis new orleans series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="176" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>only
     problem is that the pilot nearly put me to sleep and if it weren't 
    for the acting abilities of Scott Bakula and Lucas Black (remember 
    him as a kid on the late, lamented TV series <B><A HREF="american_gothic_tv_series.htm">AMERICAN
     GOTHIC</A></B> [1995 - 1996]?), I would have turned it off. Even the 
    usually dependable CCH Pounder is wasted here as the team's coroner 
    and the show is brightened for a few moments by the video appearance 
    of Ducky (David McCallum), but it quickly switched back to boring 
    mode when his time was over. So what is the trick they use for ending 
    each part for their commercial breaks? <B>NCIS</B> uses a black &amp; 
    white flash-forward and <B>NCIS: LOS ANGELES</B> uses a series of 
    quick black &amp; white images with the sound of a camera clicking. 
    This new series ends each commercial break with the final frame being 
    saturated in color and solarized. The problem with network TV today 
    is that we are being overrun with crime procedural shows and not 
    enough of a mixture of other entertainment (except for reality shows, 
    which I never watch). While some of them are good, I found this 
    series lacking in the plot department and hope it gets better as the 
    cast gels. I'm all for giving a show time to develop, but the cast 
    has to click as a team for it to be interesting (The first episode 
    catipulted it into the Top Ten TV ratings with 20.1 million watchers 
    [17.2 million live and the rest by DVR watched within the first three 
    days, which Nielsen now calls &quot;+3 Days DVR&quot;], retaining 93%

    to Debra Messing's cop character, Detective Laura Diamond, but then 
    quickly sinks into a hole of stereotypes and cliches. She's also a 
    divorced mother of two young rambunctious young boys and (yes, you 
    are about to read this correctly) her ex-husband is her boss. The 
    pilot episode had some good scenes, but it is hard to get over the 
    fact that anyone could actually believe that her ex-husband (who 
    cheated on Laura and now wants her back) would be assigned her boss. 
    I know of no police department that would allow this and Laura would 
    automatically be assigned to another precinct. Besides, it is up 
    against CBS' powerhouse reality series <B><A HREF="survivor_tv_series_2000.htm">SURVIVOR</A></B>,
     so this show stands a snowball's chance in Hell of surviving unless

     which shows how a procedural show should be done right. When the 
    show first opens, we are experiencing four college students 
    discussing the best way to dispose of a body of a person they just 
    murdered by the toss of a coin. As we see the coin fly up towards the 
    camera, we flashback three months earlier, where the four students 
    are enrolled in a class at Middleton Law School, where the teacher, 
    Annalise Keating (the amazing Viola Davis), teaches her class with an 
    iron fist and is just as hard on her students as she is on the law 
    (She is a defense attorney and calls her class &quot;How To Get Away 
    With Murder&quot;, but it is really a crash course on how to get 
    guilty people off murder cases). Her first case involves a woman 
    known as &quot;The Aspirin Killer&quot;, who supposedly fed her 
    husband poisoned aspirin. This inspires the four students we have 
    seen in the first few minutes of the episode to (maybe) murder a 
    female student and we flash forward every now and then as we <A HREF="how_to_get_away_with_murder_tv_series_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/how to get away with murder 2014 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>see
     the foursome awkwardly trying to get rid of the body (and almost 
    getting caught by campus security) and failing miserably. This is 
    where the series shines. It is not just an indictment of people 
    getting away with murder, but a sharp black comedy on how difficult 
    it is to commit the perfect crime and Davis' performance as a tough 
    as nails, take no prisoners, teacher is just amazing to watch. We 
    know she enjoys what she does, but she will never break her facade to 
    show her students that part of her life (except for student Wes 
    Gibbins, expertly played by Alfred Enoch, when she confesses that she 
    and her husband have been trying desperately to have a child, but 
    even that turns out to be a big fat lie: her husband [who is white] 
    is actually cheating on her and it may be with the murdered girl and 
    she is having an affair with a police detective). She assigns her 
    students to come up with evidence to show her Aspirin Killer female 
    client not guilty and some evidence is gained by having gay sex with 
    a person of interest, even though the student isn't gay. It's a 
    wonderfully plotted episode with many surprises, which doesn't 
    surprise me one bit that it got 14 million viewers on the first 
    episode (I would usually be watching <B><A HREF="elementary_tv_series_2012.htm">ELEMENTARY</A></B>,
     but CBS decided to add another night of professional football to 
    their roster, so who knows when it will return? NOTE: It will return 
    October 30, 2014 at the same time as this series, Thank God for 
    DVRs!). The finale of the episode finds Keating getting her Aspirin 
    Killer client found not guilty by putting her boyfriend police 
    detective on the stand and forcing him to tell the truth about 
    tampered evidence (She may have been not guilty after all or did she 
    seduced him to get him to lie on the stand?), picking four students 
    to join her law firm (One being Wes. Will he become her 
    prot&eacute;g&eacute; or even her lover?), the finding of the 
    murdered body of the young female student in a water tank (the ground 
    was too frozen to bury her) and the four students burning the rug in 
    the forest the young girl was murdered on. I will keep watching to 
    see what happens and to experience Viola's intense acting abilities. 
    One of the best new series I have seen so far this season. And I 
    refuse to tell you who the four students involved in the murder are. 
    That, my friends, you will have to figure out for yourselves, but 
    don't think I have given you any clues above, because I haven't. (<B>NOTE:</B> 
    The second episode is as good, if not better, than the pilot and 
    opened up to great ratings and, as the series progresses, the writing 
    and Viola Davis' performance just gets better and better. It's first

    up with a completely unnerving scene where a stalker wearing a black 
    hoodie and a white mask pours gasoline on a woman, but she manages to 
    lock herself in her car (without her keys, but, in true TV style, the 
    stalker dangles the keys in front of her so she can see them through 
    her front window), so the stalker pours gasoline on the woman's car 
    as she puts the car in reverse, sets it on fire and the car rolls 
    backwards, slams into a telephone pole and explodes. We are then 
    introduced to Lieutenant Beth Davis (<B><A HREF="nikita_tv_series_2010-2013.htm">NIKITA</A></B>'s
     Maggie Q), who heads the LAPD's Threat Assessment Unit (TAU), as she

    glassy-eyed students that six million people in the United States are 
    stalked each year and breaks down the statistics. She then asks the 
    students if they have any questions and, of course, all the questions 
    they ask are stupid. We are then introduced to former New York 
    Detective Jack Larsen (Dylan McDermott of last season's failed series <B><A HREF="hostages_tv_series_2013.htm">HOSTAGES</A></B>)
     as he gets dressed to join the TAU team as its newest member. 
    Problem is, Det. Larsen may be a stalker himself, as he had an affair 
    with the Deputy Chief's wife in NYC (who was an Assistant District 
    Attorney there) and now has moved to L.A., where his ex-lover and son 
    live. His first meeting with Lt. Davis (who is a hard-ass and has 
    been a stalking victim herself) doesn't go too well, as Larsen jokes 
    that he joined the team to meet Scarlett Johansson and has watched 
    all the stalker movies like <B><A HREF="fatal_attraction_1987.htm">FATAL
     ATTRACTION</A></B> and <B><A HREF="swimfan_2002.htm">SWIMFAN</A></B>,
     which makes him qualified for the team (it's an awkward scene in a 
    pilot full of awkward scenes). Since this is another procedural show, 
    we are introduced to several suspects to the crime, but which one 
    could it be? The stalker tries his gasoline trick on another woman in 
    an elevator, but she manages to get away and be saved by Davis and 
    Larsen, only to have her kidnapped again by the stalker while she is 
    under police protection (he was hiding under her bedroom rug!) and 
    brought to a gym, where she is duct-taped to a stationary bike and 
    covered in gasoline. Davis and Larsen figure out who the stalker is 
    and save the victim just in the nick of time, where Larsen shoots and 
    kills the stalker just as he is about to strike a match (hasn't he 
    ever heard of a lighter?). This is an unremarkable police procedural 
    that was created by <B><A HREF="scream_1997.htm">SCREAM</A></B>'s 
    screenwriter Kevin Williamson and since he wrote the pilot, it is 
    full of film references and his usual celebrity name-dropping 
    baggage. Besides the pilot's effective opening, the rest of the 
    episode is nothing but your standard by-the-numbers cop show that 
    follows the basic formula of nearly every police procedural. Maggie Q 
    and Dylan McDermott have zero chemistry, which will probably doom 
    this series from ever making it to a second season. Hell, it may not 
    survive the first season. Only time will tell. Who knows, maybe there 
    will be a BUA-TAU crossover episode? (In episode 2, Larsen's ex-lover 
    gives him two weeks to leave L.A. or she will release something that 
    will end Larsen's career. Wanna make a bet he finds a way to stay in 
    L.A.? After watching four episodes, there is nothing here to 
    distinguish it from the many crime procedurals on TV, except for the 
    fact that many of the stalkers prefer black hoodies and, for some 
    unknown reason, CBS has ordered a full season of episodes. They 
    stopped the show after 18 episodes in mid-February of 2015 so they 
    could debut the show <B><A HREF="csi_cyber_tv_series_2015.htm">CSI: CYBER</A></B>

    in May 2015 on Mondays at 9:00pm, so it doesn't look good for a 
    second season. <B>NOTE:</B> CBS has canceled the series on May 11,

     show religiously because it was a tense, snappy 8-part murder 
    mystery. Too bad this new 10-part limited series follows the original 
    a little too closely, even using the original's star, <B><A HREF="doctor_who_tv_series.htm">DOCTOR
     WHO</A></B>'s David Tennant (who talks with an American accent here, 
    and not that convincingly), as Detective Emmett Carver, but instead 
    of taking place in the sleepy seaside town of Broadchurch in England, 
    this new series takes place in the coastal town of Gracepoint, 
    California (close to the Oregon border), where young boy Danny is 
    found dead in the sand next to the ocean. The storyline follows the 
    original almost exactly, except with American sensibilities, right up 
    to the internal strife within the police department where Detective 
    Carver (a new hire) takes the lead detective position that longtime 
    police officer Detective Ellie Miller (Anna Gunn of <B><A HREF="breaking_bad_tv_series_2008.htm">BREAKING
     BAD</A></B>) was promised when she got back from vacation. This 
    offers friction between the two detectives (Carver refuses to call 
    her Ellie [calling it &quot;silly&quot;] and rather use her last name 
    instead), as they try to discover who killed Danny while trying not 
    to pass any information to Ellie's nephew Owen (Kevin Zegers; <B><A HREF="wrong_turn.htm">WRONG
     TURN</A></B> - 2003), who is a newspaper reporter. There's not much 
    to recommend here if you have already seen the original, except for 
    the recurring role by Nick Nolte and an outstanding performance by 
    Michael Pe&ntilde;a (TV's <B><A HREF="shield_tv_series_2002-2008.htm">THE
     SHIELD</A></B>) as Danny's father, who may know more about his son's 
    death than he is letting on. David Tennant's Detective Carver is 
    extremely unlikable in the pilot and there are innuendos about his 
    past that also may play an important part as to why he is in 
    Gracepoint. But if you have seen the original, you will already know 
    why. There is talk that either episode 7 or 8 will divert extremely 
    from the original, but I just may bypass the proceeding episodes 
    until that happens. Others who may have not seen the original may 
    stick around to witness what happens or this series could flop 
    extremely hard. It's hard to gauge whether this series will be 
    successful or not. It is very well acted and a lot goes on in the 
    first episode, but even good series can suffer from the ratings 
    slump. I'm not against remakes of foreign shows (witness <B><A HREF="killing_tv_series_2011.htm">THE
     KILLING</A></B> and even going all the way back to <B><A HREF="all_in_the_family_tv_series_1968-1979.htm">ALL
     IN THE FAMILY</A></B>), but if you are going to do a scene-for-scene 
    remake, expect&nbsp; some backlash from those familiar with the 
    original show, no matter if only under one million Americans per 
    episode watched it on BBC America. Look at what happened when 
    director Gus Van Sant did a <A HREF="psycho_1999.htm">1998 
    scene-for-scene remake</A> of Alfred Hitchcock's <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> 
    (1960). It was villified. <B>NOTE:</B> FOX announced there will be no 
    second season. It was an &quot;Event Series&quot; so it really didn't 
    need a second season, but the British <B>BROADCHURCH</B> did get a

    still smoke.), his tough-as-nails demeanor and his thinking of humans 
    as less important than him (after all, he is an expert on the 
    occult!). Since this is a network show based on yet another DC Comics 
    character (from the comic zine &quot;Hellblazer&quot;), I was 
    expecting the worst, but Executive Producer David Goyer has found a 
    very interesting way to deal with Constantine's smoking addiction 
    (you have to play close attention to really get it) and star Matt 
    Ryan, who plays Constantine, assured audiences at this years' NY 
    Comic-Con that the character wouldn't be &quot;de-balled&quot;. And 
    judging by the pilot, he hasn't. There is plenty of&nbsp; 
    Constantine's patented cursing (some of the words they come up with 
    to replace the ones not allowed to be said on network TV are pure 
    genius) and human-hating, but since his job is mainly to keep Satan's 
    minions from coming up to the Earth and taking over the planet to 
    possess people he doesn't have feelings for would be a task that any 
    fallen angel with his soul damed to Hell would have a problem with.

    the DC Comics origins show <B><A HREF="gotham_tv_series_2014.htm">GOTHAM</A></B>),

    season of <B><A HREF="arrow_tv_series_2012.htm">ARROW</A></B> in late 
    2015. Both DC series are produced by Warner Bros. TV, which made the 
    guest spot possible. Ryan will guest in episode five, entitled 
    &#147;Haunted.&#148; <B>ARROW</B> star Stephen Amell has already been 
    a big proponent of the crossover &#150; back in May the actor 
    publicly offered on twitter to guest star on the show if it were 
    renewed by another network or streaming service. Bringing <B>CONSTANTINE</B> 
    to <B>ARROW</B> proper at least saves the character, and furthers 
    that show&#146;s increasing comfort with comic book themes. Starting 
    out with a much more grounded, gritty premise that eschewed super 
    powers in favor of what amounts to ramped up special forces training, 
    with the introduction of sister series <B><A HREF="flash_tv_series_2014.htm">THE
     FLASH</A></B>, <B>ARROW</B> has increasingly embraced comic book 
    themes. (Including the resurrection of the dead.) Bringing an actual 
    wizard into the mix makes for a very different show than the one that 
    premiered in 2012. Related to this, last spring during PaleyFest, <B>THE
     FLASH</B> and <B>ARROW</B> executive producer Greg Berlanti 
    suggested similarly increasing comic book-heavy themes for that show, 
    teasing an adaptation of the DC Comics crossover event 
    &#147;Flashpoint Crisis.&#148; <B>*</B>&nbsp; (Drumroll please) And 
    the first cancellation of the 2014 - 2015 Season is: ABC's <B><A HREF="manhattan_love_story_tv_series_2014.htm">MANHATTAN
     LOVE STORY</A></B> (Tuesdays 8:30pm; and I know, I never heard of it 
    either!). One of two half-hour situation comedies that led into the 
    second season of Marvel's <B><A HREF="agents_of_shield_tv_series_2013.htm">AGENTS
     OF S.H.I.E.L.D.</A></B>, which is floundering at its new 9:00pm time 
    slot. The new sitcom was averaging 2.4 million viewers per episode 
    and was canceled after four episodes were shown. ABC also canceled 
    the second half hour sitcom, <B><A HREF="selfie_tv_series_2014.htm">SELFIE</A></B>,
     that occupied the Tuesday 8:00pm timeslot, but will burn off the 13 
    episodes (two in a row) and then it will be buried in the TV show 
    graveyard. (<B>UPDATE:</B> ABC decided against doing this and show 
    Christmas specials and repeats of other shows instead. The final 
    seven episodes of both <B>MANHATTAN LOVE STORY</B> and <B>SELFIE</B> 
    will be shown on streaming service Hulu.) R.I.P. More cancellation 
    news: NBC has canceled their two new Thursday night comedies, <B><A HREF="bad_judge_tv_series_2014.htm">BAD
     JUDGE</A></B> (9:00pm), which averaged 4 million viewers, and <B><A HREF="a_to_z_tv_series_2014.htm">A
     TO Z</A></B> (9:30pm), which averaged 2.4 million viewers. Both will 
    run their full thirteen episode orders and then be replaced with as 
    yet, unnamed series. Fox also mercifully pulled the plug on their 
    reality series <B><A HREF="utopia_tv_series_2014.htm">UTOPIA</A></B> 
    (Fridays 8:00pm) after it was pulling in a measly 1.5 million viewers 
    per episode after getting 4 million viewers when it premiered. It 
    seems that no one was interested to see if Fox could make the 
    &quot;perfect society&quot; by isolating 15 people in a secret spot 
    and hoping for a New World Order (Just like Fox would like it). It 
    also seems that people are finally growing tired of reality 
    programming, as many established reality shows have opened to 
    terrible numbers this year and cable networks are finally switching 
    to scripted shows (even SyFy said they were going back to the time 
    when their network was more successful, which means less reality 
    programming and awful original movies and more &quot;must see&quot; 
    TV like the crazy, sexy <B><A HREF="lexx_tv_series.htm">LEXX</A></B>

     WALKING DEAD</A></B>, which opened up with over 17 million viewers 
    on its fourth season premiere (God knows why. It's such a cliched 
    show). Fox has also said their new drama <B><A HREF="red_band_society_tv_series_2014-2015.htm">RED
     BAND SOCIETY</A></B> would not get any more episodes made this 
    season after the initial 13 episode order (10 episodes will air in 
    2014 and the remaining three will be aired &quot;sometime in 
    2015&quot;). Fox has not said the show has been canceled, but it 
    doesn't bode well when three episodes will be burned off at a later 
    undertemined date. <B>Bad News Dept.:</B> The 2014 - 2015 TV Season

    move to Wednesdays @ 8:00pm, where the final eight episodes will air. 
    Speaking of CBS: They canceled the half hour sitcom <B><A HREF="millers_tv_series_2013-2014.htm">THE
     MILLERS</A></B> on November 14, 2014 after having a successful run 
    in the 2013 - 2014 Season. They moved it from Thursday to Monday this 
    year, where ratings were anemic (Monday is one of the busiest nights 
    on TV, with too many choices of programs to choose from) and added 
    Sean Hayes to the cast this year, but it still failed anyway. The 
    last episode will air on November 17, 2014. CBS will burn off the 
    remaining episodes on Saturdays during the Summer of 2015. Also: The 
    USA Network announced on December 7, 2015 that the fifth season of <B><A HREF="covert_affairs_tv_series_2010.htm">COVERT
     AFFAIRS</A></B> would be its last. Since the fifth season has 
    already aired, fans of the show will get no resolution to the ongoing 
    story arcs. I ask you: Is this any way to treat viewers loyal to the 
    show for five years? At least make a final TV Movie to tie up loose 
    ends. On January 13, 2015, the USA Network announced that its 
    heavily-advertised freshman comedy series, <B><A HREF="benched_tv_series_2014.htm">BENCHED</A></B> 
    (who played all those commercials for the series where the show's 
    star, Eliza Coupe, gave all her ex-bosses the middle finger [which 
    were optically blurred out, but not that you wouldn't notice what she 
    was doing] and told them &quot;You can all go piss up a rope!&quot; 
    during the daytime, no less!), would not be renewed for another 
    season. <B>Speaking of the end of Fall Season:</B> This practice of 
    interrupting a show for two months or more and then bringing it back 
    has got to stop. When <B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B> 
    was on the air and they did the same thing, audiences complained and 
    ABC then started showing the series uninterrupted until all the 
    episodes for the season were shown. But the practice seems to have 
    made a comeback. Case in point: <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE
     BLACKLIST</A></B> will end its Fall Season on November 10, 2014 
    (where we see Alan Alda explode to pieces with a bomb locked around 
    his neck [Where else can you possibly see that?] and Peter Stormare 
    getting shot at point-blank range by Red) and won't return until the 
    first week of February 2015 (right after the Super Bowl on February 
    1, 2015, and it will be the first part of a two-parter) and then will 
    move to its new timeslot and day starting Thursday February 5, 2015 
    at 9:00pm (Talk about cutting your own throat! They will definitely 
    have to tone down the violence for a 9:00pm timeslot.). NBC will 
    debut another new show, <B><A HREF="state_of_affairs_tv_series_2014.htm">STATE
     OF AFFAIRS</A></B>, in its timeslot the following week (They are 
    promoting it as &quot;From The Director of <B>THE BLACKLIST</B>&quot;.
     Which one? [Turns out it is Joe Carnahan, who directed two episodes 
    of <B>THE BLACKLIST</B> in 2013 and is Executive Producer of both 
    series]) and air that series in its 13 episode entirety (It will then 
    be taken over by yet another hospital show, the second season of the 
    limited series <B><A HREF="night_shift_tv_series_2015.htm">THE NIGHT SHIFT</A></B>,
     in February 2015, which, on May 8, 2015, NBC announced it would be 
    renewed for a third season). Meanwhile, people hungry for more of <B>THE
     BLACKLIST</B> (myself included) will have to wait nearly three 
    months for the show to return. I find this practice horrid and 
    harmful for the series. What if <B>STATE OF AFFAIRS</B> is not a 
    well-liked show (It was officially canceled on May 5, 2015 by NBC, so 
    there will be no Season 2) and the audience switches to another 
    channel, gets involved with another series and then decides to stay 
    with it until the season is over? What series suffers? Time to stop 
    this crap and start showing the entire season on a regular basis. I 
    know that December is considered a rerun month what with Thanksgiving 
    just over and everyone out shopping for Christmas, so they don't have 
    as much time for TV, but to hold back a series for three months is 
    unacceptable. That practice might work well for cable (think <B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE
     WALKING DEAD</A></B> and the final season of <B><A HREF="mad_men_tv_series_2007-2013.htm">MAD

    (Sundays 8:00pm) is a lighthearted fantasy series that takes up where 
    the <A HREF="librarian_tv_movies_2004-2008.htm">three Noah Wyle TV Movies</A> 
    (2004 - 2008) left off. Wyle is Librarian Flynn Carsen, who is in 
    charge of keeping real magic from permeating the human race, but a 
    competing faction of evildoers unleashes the magic into the world, 
    forcing Flynn to take on three new Librarians (Christian Kane as 
    Jake; Lindy Booth as Cassandra; and John Kim as Ezekial) and a former 
    Secret Service agent named Eve (Rebecca Romijn) as their protector. 
    When the main Library is &quot;lost&quot;, the three new Librarians 
    and Eve must use an annex, run by Jenkins (a welcome return to TV by 
    John Larroquette) and try to retrieve all the magic that escaped into 
    the world, while Flynn ventures out on a quest all his own (Wyle is 
    only occasionally going to appear on the first season of this show 
    because he is busy filming the last season of <B><A HREF="falling_skies_tv_series_2011.htm">FALLING
     SKIES</A></B>, also on TNT). While basically nothing more than a 
    humorous takeoff on <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS
     OF THE LOST ARK</A></B> (1981), this series shows promise, thanks to 
    a talented cast and some very funny guest appearances, including Bob 
    Newhart, Jane Curtin (both returning from the TV Movies), Bruce 
    Campbell (as Santa Claus), Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Matt Fewer as the 
    mysterious bad guy Dulaque. The episodes so far have been fun without 
    overly relying on graphic violence and, while there is some dodgy CGI 
    on view, it is perfect viewing for both children and adults alike. My 
    only problem in the beginning was the shameless over-acting by Noah 
    Wyle (if there were any more scenery, he would chew it up, but I 
    guess that is to compensate for his very grim character on <B>SKIES</B>),
     but now that John Larroquette is the show's anchor (and gets off 
    some very funny one-liners), the show has taken-on an identity of its 
    own. I hope this series lasts a few seasons, as long as they can keep 
    the imagination flowing and the humor funny. (<B>NOTE:</B> The series 
    had one of the shortest runs I can remember in a long time. This was 
    due to them showing some new episodes back-to-back. I really see no 
    common sense in that move. Especially on a Sunday night when there is 
    so much on TV. On December 15, 2015, it was renewed for a third 
    season.) <B>*</B> Fox's <B><A HREF="backstrom_tv_series_2015.htm">BACKSTROM</A></B> 
    (Thursdays 9:00pm), created by Hart Hanson (<B><A HREF="bones_tv_series_2005.htm">BONES</A></B>

     M.D.</A></B> (2004 - 2012) if he were a police detective. Rainn 
    Wilson (formerly the star of the U.S. version of <B><A HREF="office_tv_series_2005-2013.htm">THE
     OFFICE</A></B> [2005 - 2013] and also a Producer of this show) 
    portrays the acerbic cigar-chomping, Slurpee-drinking Lieutenant 
    Everett Backstrom, an overweight, high cholesterol, high blood 
    pressure, and enlarged-heart cop (yes, he is a physical mess) who was 
    just put back on Detective duty after spending a long time in Traffic 
    Division because of his health. His Indian (as in India) doctor, Dr. 
    Deb (Rizwan Manji), hands him a prescription that simply says 
    &quot;Make a friend this week&quot; or else he will put Backstrom 
    back on traffic duty. Better said than done. His first case is the 
    apparent suicide of the son of Senator Tobias Percival (Kyle Secor), 
    who is found hanging from a railroad bridge during a pouring 
    rainstorm, a case<A HREF="backstrom_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/backstrom 2015 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
    which he shares with Det. Sgt. John Almond (an excellent Dennis 
    Haysbert, who can be seen as the spokesperson for Allstate on TV 
    commercials and was formerly the star of <A HREF="unit_tv_series.htm"><B>THE
     UNIT</B></A> (2006 - 2009), who also happens to be a Preacher on 
    weekends (His small piece of dialogue about having &quot;black 
    balls&quot; to a rugby player is the best line in the pilot episode). 
    Backstrom believes that this is not a suicide and was actually a 
    murder and asks for help from his gay live-in thief Gregory Valentine 
    (Thomas Dekker; who supplies Backstrom's abode with expensive stolen 
    goods! Backstrom's sexual orientation is purposely kept a mystery.) 
    to help him find information on who would want the Senator's son 
    dead. After many false leads (a direct steal from <B>HOUSE</B>), 
    Backstrom finally solves the case, but not without doing something so 
    stupid, it will probably come back to haunt him on future episodes 
    (The episodes are not being shown in order [the fifth episode shot 
    was actually their second aired episode], so this throws a monkey 
    wrench into that theory). This series, based on a set of novels by 
    Swedish criminologist and novelist Leif G.W. Persson, is the type of 
    anti-hero series that seems to be so prevalent today and Rainn Wilson 
    acquits himself nicely in his role as the sarcastic, 
    I-hate-everybody, new head of Portland, Oregon's Police Bureau's 
    Special Crimes Unit (SCU). Everyone in the series seems to have a 
    quirk of their own and Backstrom does get to make a &quot;friend&quot;
     at the end of the episode (in a back-handed way), but it doesn't 
    seem to satisfy his doctor, who wants to see him every week if he 
    wants to keep his new job (a quite obvious plot device so Backstrom 
    can make fun of the male doctor's name, &quot;Deb&quot;, and also 
    have the doctor keep Backstrom in line, but Backstrom changes that 
    plot device with just a simple sentence, making sure it is not a 
    weekly thing). It seems Fox completely forgot about their other 
    failed anti-hero lawyer series from last year, <B><A HREF="rake_tv_series_2014.htm">RAKE</A></B>,
     and decided to take another chance on making anti-heroes popular 
    again. If anyone can do it, Rainn Wilson can (but then again, I 
    thought Greg Kinnear could do the same thing), but it depends on the 
    stories that will be told in this first season's thirteen episodes. I 
    do love quirky series and this is definitely one (not to mention 
    atmospheric, with Portland's continuous rain [actually filmed in 
    Vancouver, British Columbia] and Backstrom wearing an orange-hooded 
    rain slicker as much as possible [shades of the film <B><A HREF="dont_look_now_1973.htm">DON'T
     LOOK NOW</A></B> - 1973, where the mysterious villian wears a 
    red-hooded rain slicker]), but we will have to wait for the ratings 
    to decide whether this series will survive. I certainly hope it does. 
    It replaces the time slot occupied by <B><A HREF="gracepoint_tv_series_2014.htm">GRACEPOINT</A></B>'s
     first complete ten-episode season (which actually turned out really 
    satisfying after veering off direction in the seventh episode from 
    its British counterpart and was rather well done and unexpected) and 
    will eventually be up against the new day and timeslot for the 
    popular NBC series <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE BLACKLIST</A></B>,
     so I hope it does well enough in the ratings to merit a second 
    season. Only time will tell (This is also the first time I have seen 
    the word &quot;Dick&quot; used in an advertisement to describe 
    someone, although it could be taken two ways, but I think we all know 
    what direction Fox was taking, don't we?). <B>THE BLACKLIST</B> seems 
    to be getting good ratings on its new day and time slot, so this 
    doesn't bode very well for the new series. Too bad. <B>NOTE:</B> FOX 
    announced that there would be no second season. <B>*</B> My

    them (and since I have a Roku 3 player, watching it on my 
    large-screen HD TV will be no trouble). It's excellently produced, 
    even better acted by Welliver (<B><A HREF="deadwood.htm">DEADWOOD</A></B> 
    - 2004-2006) and with directors like Ernest R. Dickerson behind the 
    camera and Bosch crime novel creator Michael Connelly writing some of 
    the screenplays for the 2015 season, you know you are going to be in 
    for lots of surprises (Connelly says every episode unravels like a 
    chapter in a book). I, for one, am looking forward to the day when I 
    can binge-watch all 10 episodes of Season One. So should you. If you 
    don't get Amazon, now is the time to do so. <B>NOTE:</B> On March 18,

     - 2015 TV SEASON PART 2:</B> It must be weird for Patricia Arquette 
    to win a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award&reg; one week and then 
    to headline a new spinoff series on TV the next week, but that is 
    what she is doing with the new CBS series <B><A HREF="csi_cyber_tv_series_2015.htm">CSI:
     CYBER</A></B> (Wednesdays 10:00pm) and it turns out to be nothing 
    but a typical crime procedural with a computer tech slant that has 
    another The Who song as it's opening (&quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;,
     which is, strangely, appropriate). After a couple of solo 
    appearances on <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION</A></B> 
    (2000 - 2015), Ms. Arquette, who plays Avery Ryan, gets her own team 
    located in Washington, D.C, which includes James Van Der Beek (The 
    Beek!) as Detective Elijah Mundo (who happens to be a crack shot), 
    Charley Koontz as computer expert Daniel Krumitz, Hayley Kiyoko as 
    Raven Ramirez (another computer expert); Shad Moss (the musical 
    artist formerly known as &quot;Bow Wow&quot;) as new intern Brody 
    Nelson (who works out his computer problems in rhyme), a convicted 
    hacker who Avery wants on her team to hopefully teach her and her 
    underlings some new things or he goes to prison, and the always 
    welcome Peter MacNicol as Head Agent Simon Sifter (in a role not that 
    unsimilar from the defunct series <A HREF="numb3rs_tv_series_2005-2010.htm"><B>NUMB3RS</B></A> 
    - 2005-2010). The show begins like all computer geeks do: Arquette 
    just surfuing the Internet while sipping on a Slurpee (shades of Abby 
    on <B><A HREF="ncis_tv_series.htm">NCIS</A></B> - 2003-Present) when 
    a baby kidnapping<A HREF="csi_cyber_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/csi cyber 2015 series premiere tv ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    report pops-up on her screen and she assembles the team to go to 
    Baltimore, Maryland. The parents reported hearing a bunch of 
    different foreign voices on their baby monitor/camera, but the 
    Baltimore police stupidly unhook the camera's connection and destroy 
    the evidence (It wouldn't have made any difference anyway because the 
    kidnappers took the SIM card. Wait, baby monitors have SIM cards?). 
    After some hard work, which involves a women who uses her breast 
    implants as a way of being a drug mule, a shootout with a guy on a 
    motorcycle (this is where Elijah's gun skills come in handy) and 
    plenty of computer work (a lot of tech which still doesn't exist 
    today, including a full body hologram, not unlike the one Angela uses 
    on <B><A HREF="bones_tv_series_2005.htm">BONES</A></B> - 
    2005-Present), the team uncover a baby selling ring run by the 
    Russians, where the highest bidder gets a kidnapped baby (there have 
    been two more baby kidnappings and the babies have yet to be found 
    when they bust the headquarters). A computer holds the whereabouts of 
    the two babies, but there is one problem: It needs a twenty character 
    password to unlock the computer, which could take 3.4 billion years 
    to decipher. Brody deciphers it on the first try using his rhyming 
    technique (it is so unbelievable as to be funny) and Elijah saves one 
    of the babies from certain drowning (Awwww!). The episode closes with 
    Avery sitting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial after telling 
    Brody that she saved his ass from prison because when the internet 
    was new, some hacker stole all her private psychiatric practice 
    files, one of her patients was murdered and she has never found him. 
    She spends every night on the internet looking for him, hence the 
    beginning of the episode, and she could use his help. Truth be told, 
    there is nothing really new about this show. As you can see my 
    synopsis, this is more of a Frankenstein show that borrows tech and 
    peculiarities from other, more popular shows. Arquette makes a bland 
    leading lady and hopefully she will loosen-up in upcoming episodes, 
    otherwise people will tune this show out fast, like they did the new 
    show cop-buddy dramedy <B><A HREF="battle_creek_tv_series_2015.htm">BATTLE
     CREEK</A></B> (Sundays 10:00pm, which CBS announced there would be 
    no second season; not much of a surprise, but the show grew on me a 
    little), which ended up last on CBS' ratings list. But to be fair, 
    any show that plays Sundays at 10:00pm on CBS is like asking the Grim 
    Reaper to touch you on the shoulder. Why doesn't CBS do us all a 
    favor and bring back <B><A HREF="csi_miami_tv.htm">CSI: MIAMI</A></B> 
    (2002 - 2012)? At least that show was colorful and had some great 
    characters, including David Caruso, who could be an unrelenting 
    badass when pushed too far. I don't hold much hope for <B>CSI: CYBER</B>.
     If they really want to get my attention and make me a weekly viewer, 
    tell the truth about what happens to a person who has their identity 
    stolen by someone on the 'net. That I can identify with and if done 
    right, can be more frightening than any fictional cyber-crime. 
    Otherwise, this could end the legacy of the CSI dynasty. And no one 
    would hate that more than me. Just one thing: Why hasn't CBS 
    announced the cancellation of the original <B>CSI:</B>, the show that 
    outlasted all its spin-offs? Ted Danson has already signed on to a 
    new series and George Eads has stated that he wouldn't come back for 
    a 16th Season, so it seems to me that CBS should finally issue a 
    press release announcing the end of the dynasty. Or maybe they are 
    just waiting for this series to fail. Even <B><A HREF="stalker_tv_series_2014.htm">STALKER</A></B> 
    (which this new show occupies its time slot) was more entertaining 
    than this. <B>NOTE:</B> CBS is showing this series out of sequence. 
    The third episode shown was actually the 8th episode shot, which is 
    an indicator that CBS does not have much faith in the series 
    (Although this is during &quot;March Madness&quot; and CBS may be 
    burning off the more boring of the episodes. Only time will tell.). <B>NOTE
     #2:</B> The series is getting respectable, but not great, ratings 
    and CBS will soon announce whether it will be back for a second 
    season. So far, it doesn't look good because the series has been 
    somewhat ridiculous in the storylines. One newspaper critic called it 
    &quot;A lousy show you should be watching&quot;. He went on to 
    explain that even though the series is one of the worst on TV, it may 
    teach people to be more careful when they are online!<B> NOTE #3:</B> 
    On May 11, 2015, CBS announced that the show was renewed for a second 
    season (Ted Danson will be joining the cast as &quot;D.B. 
    Russell&quot; from <B>CSI:</B>) and that the original <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI:
     CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATIONS</A></B> would get a two-hour TV movie so 
    it can get the proper closure it needs. While I am not too pleased 
    with the former being renewed, the latter bit of news pleases me. <B>CSI:</B> 
    has been a mainstay on CBS since 1999 and won the network many 
    Emmy&reg; and other awards, not to mention being the top-rated show 
    on any network for four seasons. <B>*</B> Anyone but me underwhelmed 
    by the first 90-minute episode of USA Network's new &quot;Event 
    Series&quot; (a new term for the old-fashioned Mini-series) <B><A HREF="dig_tv_series_2015.htm">DIG</A></B> 
    (Thursdays 10:00pm)? After months of promotional commercials and even 
    inserting 3-second nearly-subliminal ads in all their programming (<B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT</A></B> repeats had at least one 
    of those subliminal ads in nearly every episode, sometimes right in 
    the middle of an important scene!), the first episode caused more 
    yawns than wonderment. I love TV shows and movies about ancient 
    secret <A HREF="dig_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dig 2015 mini-series tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>passageways,
     hidden treasure, mind-bending puzzles, booby-traps and archaeology 
    object finds and their repercussions, but this premiere episode, 
    which some critics said was a contender to <B><A HREF="da_vinci_code_2006.htm">THE
     DA VINCI CODE</A></B> (2006) theatrical film (A movie I didn't much 
    care for because it was boring, too. My tastes run more towards <B><A HREF="national_treasure_2004_national_treasure_book_of_secrets_2007.htm">NATIONAL
     TREASURE</A></B> [2004] and <B><A HREF="national_treasure_2004_national_treasure_book_of_secrets_2007.htm">NATIONAL
     TREASURE 2: BOOK OF SECRETS</A></B> [2007]), but <B>DIG</B> is 
    nothing but a basic biblical End Of Times story that spends too much 
    time on other things, like the relationship between stars Jason 
    Isaacs and Anne Heche (Is she a lesbian in real life or just 
    bi-curious?), while Isaacs investigates the murder of a young female 
    archaeologist in Jerusalem (he met her a day earlier and she reminds 
    him of his dead daughter; she even says something that her daughter 
    would always say to him) who may have discovered the Ark of the 
    Covenant (sound familiar?), with contents inside (including a 
    breastplate of a high priest which enables whomever wears it to talk 
    to God, but the 12 stones in the breastplate are missing, so it won't 
    work) that may predict the date of the Apocalypse (or the Rapture if 
    you prefer). There's also a sub-plot about a young boy named Joshua 
    (are you kidding me?) being kept prisoner in a compound in New Mexico 
    run by &quot;The Pastor&quot;, so the boy may be something special 
    and held prisoner by a religious cult (He escapes, much to The 
    Pastor's chagrin, so he has one of his female underlings find him, 
    shoot and kill him [She says to Joshua: &quot;It's too late. Your 
    feet have touched the ground.&quot; before she pulls the trigger.], 
    only for a second Joshua to show up at the compound, Could it be 
    cloning or something more sinister?) and some other questionable 
    doings, like Isaacs running and being able to keep up with a speeding 
    car. How will all this tie together? Will you watch the remaining 
    nine 60-minute episodes to find out how all this will piece together? 
    Based on the first episode, I sure won't, but I will give the second 
    episode a try just to see if it improves. If it does, I will DVR it 
    and watch the episodes when I have time. But, with me at least, first 
    impressions are usually the mitigating factor, and my first 
    impression is telling me that I probably won't be watching it past 
    Episode 2. While I do not mind mini-series (Oh, excuse me, Event 
    Series), this one looks like it is going to be a long slog and could 
    have been made into a three hour TV Movie. Early ratings of the first 
    episode were soft, but I'm sure the USA Network will give this a 
    chance to grow. They just put too much time and effort in promoting 
    this show to just drop it. The USA Network did itself no favors by 
    airing <A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">all</A> <A HREF="indiana_jones_and_the_temple_of_doom_1983.htm">four</A> <A HREF="indiana_jones_and_the_last_crusade_1989.htm">Indiana</A> <A HREF="indiana_jones_and_the_kingdom_orf_the_crystal_skull_2008.htm">Jones</A> 
    films before the series premiere, showing the viewing audience how 
    this type of thing can be done right in two to 2.5 hours (even if the 
    fourth movie was the weakest of the series). Like all ancient 
    artifacts, only time will tell whether this Event Series will survive 
    or whether it will fade away into dust. They are showing the first 
    episode a lot in their rotation during the first week, so they are 
    anxious to get this show to be seen by as many people as possible. I 
    know as soon as some people see that part of the show is subtitled 
    (most of it does take place in Jerusalem), they will instantly change 
    channels because they are too lazy to read while they watch. <B>*</B> 
    A&amp;E's <B><A HREF="returned_tv_series_2015.htm">THE RETURNED</A></B> 
    (Mondays 10:00pm) is a very well filmed and suspenseful series, but 
    there are two huge problems with it: Problem #1: If you have been 
    watching the original <A HREF="returned_tv_series_2012.htm">French 
    series of the same name</A> on VOD<A HREF="returned_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/returned 2015 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    that premiered in 2012, you will immediately notice that this new 
    series is nearly a scene-for-scene steal of the original series, and 
    the few of us that watched the first season of the French series are 
    highly disappointed in A&amp;E for not deviating from the original's 
    plot (not to mention that ABC already has a remake on TV called <B><A HREF="resurrection_tv_series_2014.htm">RESURRECTION</A></B>,
     but it looks like this is it's final season; on May 7, 2014, ABC 
    confirmed that fact by cancelling the series) and sticking with the 
    same format. For newbies, though, this is an entirely creepy series 
    about a school bus-full of children returning from a ski trip dying 
    when their bus goes over a cliff after avoiding a young boy in the 
    road. A few years later, the children begin climbing up the ravine 
    and return home. They haven't aged at all and remember nothing about 
    the bus crash and dying. Each episode is about one of the children 
    returning back to their family and the problems it causes. Are they 
    really their children or are they something else? The subplot is 
    about the young boy, Victor/Henry (Dylan Kingwell) also returning and 
    no one knows who he is or why he is here (It is eventually revealed 
    in future episodes). Which brings us to Problem #2, and it's a big 
    one: Even though it's at 42-minute program meant to fit in a one-hour 
    timeslot, A&amp;E shows commercials every six minutes and let the 
    show run over 3 or 4 minutes after the hour mark. This is just 
    unacceptable and may not be picked up by some DVRs, making each 
    show's finale unviewable to those who have DVR'ed it rather than 
    watch it live. This is just corporate greed, plain and simple and 
    there is no other excuse for it. This use to be a common practice 
    several years ago on network TV, so you wouldn't switch channels and 
    watch the next show on the network because you have already missed a 
    few minutes of another program you like on another channel, but it 
    was stopped when audiences complained because their VCRs would miss 
    the final minutes of the show (<B><A HREF="er_tv.htm">ER</A></B> was 
    particularly guilty of this). After watching the first two episodes 
    live, I have decided to DVR it from now on, but if you are going to 
    do the same thing as me, do so by adding an extra five minutes to the 
    end. Too many commercials (and I mean a lot!) spoil the mood for a 
    series like this and I hope A&amp;E learns this quick, because I, for 
    one, am sick and tired of this greedy practice, having five (!) 
    commercial breaks every 30 minutes. Otherwise this is a very 
    watchable show (all 10 episodes of the first season 
    &quot;written&quot; by Carlton Cuse, and I put that in parenthesis 
    because all he did was translate the French series into English to 
    make it more digestible for U.S. audiences). I would suggest waiting 
    until this series hits DVD &amp; Blu-Ray before watching it, but that 
    would be a double-edged sword. If it doesn't find an audience on TV, 
    A&amp;E has the habit of pulling series off the air very fast 
    (Remember what happened to <B><A HREF="those_who_kill_tv_series_2014.htm">THOSE
     WHO KILL</A></B> last year that occupied the very same time and 
    channel?). I suggest that you DVR it, even if you don't watch it 
    because ratings now take DVR recordings into the show's ratings 
    tally. I will watch it because I can fast forward through the 
    commercials rather quickly, but none of us would have to do that if 
    A&amp;E cared about their audience rather than corporate sponsors. 
    Shameful. <B>NOTE:</B> Even though the commercial breaks are 
    frequent, the show managed to reel me in, hook, line and sinker. It 
    gets better and better as each episode progresses and has some truly 
    frightening scenes, such what Henry makes Peter (Jeremy Sisto) see in 
    a graveyard (Peter was partly responsible for the murder of Henry and 
    his mother 29 <A HREF="daredevil_netflix_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/daredevil 2015 netflix ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>years
     ago). It keeps getting better and better, so I really hope a second 
    season will happen. <B>NOTE #2:</B> The series has been canceled in 
    June 2015. I guess A&amp;E shot themselves in their own foot with all 
    those commercials and the show not ending on time. People just 
    stopped viewing out of disgust. <B>*</B> The best series of 2015? 
    That's a no-brainer. It's Netflix's <B><A HREF="daredevil_netflix_series_2015.htm">DAREDEVIL</A></B>.
     Now hear me out before you shake your head. This is not your normal 
    superhero series and, please, ignore that <A HREF="daredevil_2003.htm">2003
     abortion of a film</A> of the same name starring Ben Affleck. This 
    is a superhero series for adults, not for kids. It's brutal, honest, 
    has great action scenes (better than most theatrical films) and has 
    one hell of a leading actor in Charlie Cox (&quot;Owen Slater&quot; 
    on two seasons of <B><A HREF="boardwalk_empire_tv_series.htm">BOARDWALK
     EMPIRE</A></B> - 2011-2012), who plays blind lawyer Matt Murdock by 
    day and the titled character by night, who only defends a 10 block 
    radius of his New York Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. It is also the 
    first Marvel series to earn a TV-MA Rating, which pushes the 
    violence, nudity and language into Hard-R-Rated territory. The 
    storylines don't pander to young audiences, as this is a series that 
    should not be watched by younger children, because the hero suffers 
    just as much (if not more) than the people he beats to a pulp (Maybe 
    children should watch this series to realize that there are 
    consequences that go along with being a superhero). And this is not 
    your ordinary superhero. This Daredevil has no superpowers besides a 
    heightened sense of hearing (heightened because of his blindness; 
    nothing like how Daredevil &quot;sees&quot; in the Affleck film) and 
    a knowledge on how to defend himself (thanks to his mentor Stick, 
    portrayed by Scott Glenn in three episodes), but for every punch and 
    kick he throws, he gets back in return, either in punches or kicks 
    received, or the damage hitting someone else causes him. I don't want 
    to give too much away except to say that you will not ever see a 
    better staged fight sequence that comes at the end of Episode 2, as 
    it is better choreographed and filmed than most big-budget superhero 
    films and some episodes will make you tear-up for their poignancy and 
    raw emotion. Vincent D'Onofrio plays Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. The Kingpin, 
    starting in Episode 3 (and he has never done better) and Deborah Ann 
    Woll (<B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE BLOOD</A></B> - 
    2008-2014) is excellent as Karen Page, hopefully a future love 
    interest to Matt Murdock, who has nude scenes that go way past what 
    we saw of her on HBO. I will keep this short and sweet: If you don't 
    have Netflix, now you have an excellent reason to sign up, because 
    this 13-episode first season (it has already been renewed for a 
    second season) is unlike anything else you will see on TV this year. 
    Its stories, acting and technical aspects (the sound mixing is 
    extraordinary and should win an Emmy Award&reg;) are way beyond 
    average and it will shock and surprise you. When was the last time a 
    TV Series has done that to you? Look for a roster of recognizable 
    actors (including Bob Gunton, Rosario Dawson and Vondie Curtis-Hall) 
    that round out the series regulars and my favorite regular has to be 
    Elden Henson, who plays Foggy Nelson. So stop reading and start 
    watching on Netflix now! You'll thank me for recommending this. (<B>NOTE:</B>

    Dept (with one caveat): </B>FOX has finally canceled <B>AMERICAN IDOL</B> 
    and next season's 16th, and final, season will be its last. I never 
    was a fan of these &quot;Who is the best 
    singer/dancer/comedian/juggler/crotch-grabber, etc....&quot; shows 
    and this one in particuular grated on my nerves and I thought it took 
    up way too much of FOX's measly two hours of prime time programming 
    every night. On the bad news front, FOX has optioned a new series 
    from Simon Cowell. This doesn't bode well. <B>* More Than A 
    Coincidence? Dept:<A NAME="Aquarius2015"></A></B> How great is it to 
    have both David Duchovny in the new series 60's-set cop drama <B><A HREF="aquarius_tv_series_2015.htm">AQUARIUS</A></B> 
    (with a Charles Manson backdrop) and Gillian Anderson in the third 
    season of <B><A HREF="hannibal_tv_series_2013.htm">HANNIBAL</A></B> 
    (she finally gets her name in the opening of the show, making her a 
    regular) playing back-to back on Thursday night on NBC during the 
    Summer? It's a great way to get ready for the six-episode revival of <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
     X-FILES</A></B> in late January, 2016. We all know that <B>HANNIBAL</B> 
    is one of the most adult TV series on network TV (as well as being 
    extremely gruesome), but <B>AQUARIUS</B> is also adult (but more 
    conventional) in its depiction of 60's California, where troubled 
    police detective Sam Hodiak (Duchovny) agrees to find the missing 
    daughter of a former flame, who is now in the clutches and control of 
    Charles Manson (an Emmy Award&reg; worthy performance by relative 
    newcomer Gethin Anthony, whose last claim to fame was appearing in 8 
    episodes of the HBO series <B><A HREF="game_of_thrones_tv_series_2011.htm">GAME
     OF THRONES</A></B> during 2011-2012). There are surprising scenes of 
    gay sodomy and homosexuality by the bisexual Manson, but it seems 
    that NBC has over-dubbed some curse words (such as &quot;shit&quot;) 
    with more conventional words because it plays in the family-friendly 
    hour of 9:00 PM. (I'm sure all the foul language will be on the 
    Blu-Ray/DVD sets that will eventually be released) It's still a great 
    series, full of little surprises (such as the reveal of Hodiak's new 
    partner's family) that make the series stand out from most police 
    procedurals. The 60's setting is also well used, so there are no such 
    things as personal computers, DNA matching or cell phones (Hodiak 
    says something funny regarding not having a phone in his car and 
    having to find a pay phone) and Miranda Rights have just been passed, 
    so some police officers don't know how to recite it yet, including 
    Hodiak, who gives a totally improper (but hilarious) reading of it. 
    The clothing, cars and other aspects of the series are right on the 
    money (believe me, I lived through it!), so if you have not yet begun 
    to watch the series, NBC has followed the Netflix model of making all 
    13 episodes of the show available at once, so you can binge-watch 
    them if you want (I'd rather enjoy it weekly so I can get my weekly 
    Duchovny/Anderson fix, something I haven't been able to do since 
    2002). The networks are finally wising-up that the Summer is not just 
    rerun time. There are plenty of people who will watch original 
    programming if you make it available, something cable TV has been 
    doing for years. This one-two punch by NBC is a great start, since 
    CBS found success with <B><A HREF="under_the_dome_tv_series_2013.htm">UNDER
     THE DOME</A></B> during the Summer and it will be returning for a 
    third season on June 25th, which is (surprise!) Thursdays opposite <B>AQUARIUS</B>!
     What in the world were those dunderheads at CBS thinking, moving it 
    from its normal Monday 10:00 pm slot, to a different day and time? 
    Looks like Season 3 will be its last (on August 31, 2015, CBS 
    announced that <B>UNDER THE DOME</B> was canceled after three 
    seasons). This is what DVRs were invented for. This is a great time 
    to be a TV watcher and a bad time to be a CBS executive. <B>UPDATE</B>:
     On June 22, 2015, NBC announced That <B>HANNIBAL</B> has been 
    canceled after three seasons. They say rights issues are the cause 
    (they wanted to introduce Clarice Starling in Season 4, but they 
    don't have the rights to do so and it would be cost prohibitive), but 
    the real issue is that it, along with <B>AQUARIUS</B>, have been 
    getting anemic ratings (The David Duchnovy show had better numbers, 
    though). I don't know what is wrong with the viewing public or if the 
    Neislen Ratings System is just very fucked-up, but to not watch these 
    two very adult shows is a cardinal sin to me. NBC said that <B>HANNIBAL</B> 
    will run the complete third season (ending August 27, 2015) and then 
    produce no more episodes (NBC would be foolish not to air the 
    complete third season because it only costs them $100,000 an episode, 
    the cheapest amount for a scripted show on any network). Let's hope 
    some streaming service like Amazon Prime or Netflix picks it up and 
    lets it continue (Showrunner Bryan Fuller announced on July 6, 2015, 
    that both Netflix and Amazon passed on picking it up, so Fuller is 
    hoping for a future movie deal). It doesn't look good, though, since 
    Gaumont International Television, the production company responsible 
    for the show, released Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen from their 
    contracts. Getting them back may be cost prohibitive. And that's a 
    shame because Season 3 is the best season yet so far. Did you see the 
    beat-down Hannibal received in Episode 5? Classic! And Gillian 
    Anderson's performance in Episode 6 was Emmy&#153; worthy. <B>UPDATE #2:</B> 
    In the most idiotic and puzzling decision in history, NBC moved both <B>AQUARIUS</B> 
    and <B>HANNIBAL</B> to Saturdays from 9:00 to 11:00 pm. starting July 
    18, 2015, assuring <B>AQUARIUS</B>, which was pulling in decent 
    numbers, will never see a Season 2. Good move, you fucking retards at 
    NBC. You know full well that Saturday nights are when most adults go 
    out for the evening. Pissed-off doesn't describe my feelings at this 
    moment. NBC stated they did this move because their affiliates were 
    tired of pulling in such low numbers. Since <B>HANNIBAL</B> only cost 
    NBC $100,000 per episode (That's the total cost for <U>all</U> of NBC 
    and their affiliates combined) and they more than quadruple that in 
    advertising dollars alone per episode (and that is per station and 
    affiliate, so think of that staggering profit), I'm not buying that 
    explanation. It is Summer, after all, and profit is profit. It looks 
    like my DVR will be set on Saturdays for the first time in my DVR's 
    history. NBC should stand for &quot;No Body Cares&quot; or 
    &quot;'Nother Boneheaded Cock-up.&quot; And so it starts: 
    Pre-football season starts and, of course, the games are shown on NBC 
    Saturday Nights which means entire episodes of <B>AQUARIUS</B> are 
    missing from the roster and <B>HANNIBAL</B> is starting late. Make 
    sure to give your DVR plenty of time so that you don't miss the 
    endings. The April 22, 2015 episode in my TIVO says <B>HANNIBAL</B> 
    starts at 10:30 pm and only runs for 30 minutes, which is a bunch of 
    bullshit. NBC has once again shot themselves in the foot, especially 
    when it comes to fans of these two series. Sports is always more 
    important to them. They knew that when they moved both series to 
    Saturday. Fuck NBC and fuck pre-football season. BUT FUCK NBC FOR 
    KNOWINGLY PUTTING BOTH THESE SERIES IN TIME SLOTS THEY KNEW WOULD BE 
    PRE-EMPTED. <B>Quick Good New Dept:</B> NBC announced at the end of 
    June 2015 that <B>AQUARIUS</B> has been picked up for a Second 
    Season. I'm glad about that, but still confused about why they moved 
    it to Saturdays? My only reason was because their Netflix model for 
    releasing all 13 episodes of this show at once worked out great for 
    them. But I only binge on a few shows. I like to see this one play 
    out week-by-week and its audience numbers are downright anemic with 
    its latest episode (its 10th) receiving a paltry 2.5 million viewers 
    and now I am missing two episodes in a row because of pre-football 
    season. <B>* Short 'N' Sweet Dept:</B> <FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>New

    plot you can follow without having to take hallucinogens. And it 
    actually has answers you can understand. If you haven't watched it 
    from the first episode, I would suggest you stream it from the 
    beginning or wait for its eventual disc release. This is not a series 
    you can watch starting from the middle and enjoy. The last couple of

     &quot;Due to an unfortunate parallel to a real-life tragedy today, 
    USA has postponed tonight's <B>MR. ROBOT</B> season finale to air 
    next week. The freshman thriller's season finale features a very 
    graphic on-camera shooting. It's not identical to the tragedy this 
    morning in Virginia, where a TV reporter and cameraman were murdered 
    during a live broadcast, but it was close enough that USA 
    understandably decided it was wise to put a bit of distance between 
    the real and fictional events. No one who watched tonight would be 
    thinking about anything else. In a statement, the network said, 
    &quot;The previously filmed season finale of 'Mr. Robot' contains a 
    graphic scene similar in nature to today&#146;s tragic events in 
    Virginia. Out of respect to the victims, their families and 
    colleagues, and our viewers, we are postponing tonight&#146;s 
    episode.&quot;&quot; My condolences to the Virginia TV News family, 
    too. At least USA Network didn't chicken out and refuse to show a

    players who are not without their major faults. Still an element of 
    supernatural mystery, though [Eyeless and genital-less corpses, 
    anyone?], and time-jumping. But this season it is more 
    straight-forward. And R.I.P. Taylor Kitsch). The final episode of the

    11, 2015 cover</A> (shot by the still-beautiful Bo Derek, no less, 
    who has an extended cameo in the film) and then give this cheap 
    non-Union film seven pages of coverage inside to praise it (not once 
    in the lengthy article do they mention the picketing from Union 
    members while the third film was being made, but they do compare Ian 
    Ziering to Bruce Willis!). In the next issue, dated July 27 - August 
    9, 2015, they give the movie a <A HREF="sharknado_3_tv_guide_cover_july_11_2015.htm">&quot;Cheer&quot;</A>!
     Since they only give three &quot;Cheers&quot; a week (another one 
    was for the anemic CBS TV series <B><A HREF="zoo_tv_series_2015.htm">ZOO</A></B>!),
     I guess we all know where TV Guide's taste is: In their ass! I bet 
    this increases The Asylum's profile, but it is an insult to everyone 
    with a brain and those who work for film Unions everywhere. Calling 
    it &quot;Summer's Wildest Ride&quot; only shows how myopic TV Guide 
    has become. I can think of at least a hundred better things on TV 
    during the Summer than this Union-busting film, but I'm sure some of 
    those that still depend on TV Guide to give them nightly Prime Time 
    listings (I, for one, don't) will tune in to see what all the hub-bub 
    is about. I'm all for mindless entertainment, but not when it takes 
    food out of the mouths of hard-working, dues-paying film technicians 
    who were basically replaced by scabs on this film. Almost every film 
    by The Asylum (except for <B><A HREF="sharknado_2_the_second_one_2014.htm">SHARKNADO
     2: THE SECOND ONE</A></B>, which was shot in New York City, where 
    you have to use IATSE Unions to make make movies and TV shows) is a 
    non-Union film, which is why they look so cheap and tawdry. I never 
    understood the <B><A HREF="sharknado_2013.htm">SHARKNADO</A></B> 
    craze; the first film lighting up Twitter like a Christmas tree (but 
    still getting poor ratings; the ratings increased during the second, 
    third and umpteenth time they aired it after it became a Twitter 
    sensation), turning it into a juggernaut; but people need to know the 
    truth on how these films are made: On the cheap, with grade-school 
    CGI and casts of has-beens. These films may have raised the profiles 
    of Tara Reid and Ian Ziering (Which begs the question: Why?), but, in 
    reality, these two &quot;actors&quot; couldn't act their way out of a 
    paper bag (especially Reid, who is stiff as a man who just popped 
    five Viagras). And that describes this series of films perfectly: An 
    empty paper bag. The only thing inside it is hot air. And don't get 
    me started on why well-known actors and personalities are clamoring 
    to have cameos in these films (Mark Cuban as the President Of The 
    United States? David &quot;The Hoff&quot; Hasselhoff as Ian Ziering's 
    father? Bo Derek as Tara Reid's mother?). It just boggles the mind. 
    And while we are on the subject of TV Guide, why is it that 
    periodicals like Entertainment Weekly contain more full-page ads for 
    TV shows than the magazine supposedly made for TV viewers? Could it 
    be that the major networks believe TV Guide is long past its prime 
    and would rather spend their advertising budget in magazines more 
    prolific? Think about that the next time you see an issue of TV Guide 
    while standing in line at a grocery store and wondering about buying 
    it. $4.99 can be spent a lot more wisely (Hell, even Entertainment 
    Weekly is cheaper and gives you a lot more bang for your buck, but 
    yet another <A HREF="walking_dead_entertainment weekly_covers_2015.htm">THE
     WALKING DEAD cover</A> and story in the August 7, 2015 issue? Why 
    don't you change your name to THE WALKING DEAD WEELY and just get it 
    over with? Nearly every issue name-drops the show at least once.). 
    Rant over. <B>NOTE:</B> At the end of the third installment, a piece 
    of a satellite falls out of the sky and heads right for Tara Reid's 
    character, April (Yeah, I know, what are the chances of that actually 
    happenning?). The film goes to black and then asks fans to vote on 
    Twitter as to whether April lives or dies at the beginning of <B>SHARKNADO

    50's songs, or at least facsimilies of 50's songs since this film 
    couldn't afford the real thing). Part 4 also had the most cameos of 
    all four films and it was particularly sad to see how much plastic 
    surgery Carrot Top (as an Uber driver) and Wayne Newton (who sings a 
    snippit of a Sharknado tune) have had. They look like storefront 
    window mannequins (In all fairness, Carrot Top looks like a clown 
    mannequin.). The films also exist in the same universe as the <B><A HREF="lavalantula_2015.htm">LAVALANTULA</A></B> 
    (2015) <A HREF="2_lava_2_lantula_2016.htm">franchise</A>, as Steve 
    Guttenberg (&quot;Colton West&quot;) and Ian Ziering (&quot;Fin 
    Shepard&quot;) make cameos in each other's films using their 
    character's names. What makes this strange is that Guttenberg's 
    franchise has nothing to do with The Asylum and I prefer those films 
    over the Ziering franchise, since Guttenberg seems to be having a lot 
    of fun with his former leading man image and the first film is like a 
    mini-reunion of <B><A HREF="police_academy_1984.htm">POLICE ACADEMY</A></B> 
    (1984), with Michael Winslow, Leslie Easterbrook, and Marion Ramsey 
    all putting in appearances. And the films are funnier and have better 
    special effects, too. It also doesn't hurt that both of Guttenberg's 
    films contain appearances by the diminutive Danny Woodburn (best 
    remembered as Kramer's friend on <B><A HREF="seinfeld_tv_series.htm">SEINFELD</A></B>),
     an actor who really knows how to make you laugh. Here he plays

    should bring to light just what clinical depression can do to a 
    person. It proves that having all the money and fame in the world 
    cannot beat this dreaded disease. While having cancer is bad, some 
    forms of it can be cured, but clinical depression has no cure. Every 
    day, 117 people leave this world by taking their own lives because 
    they believe it is the only way out. While some of those suicides may 
    be from bullying and other factors, clinical depression is the 
    leading cause of taking one's lives. People say, &quot;But don't they<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/robin williams photo3 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="181" HEIGHT="245" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Robin Williams, RIP" BORDER="0"> 
    understand their actions affect everyone, especially their loving 
    family?&quot; The answer is yes, they do, but the depression is so 
    bad it overwhelms their desire to stay alive. It is apparent that 
    psychiatrists and all the drugs they prescribe do absolutely no good. 
    They are only a stopgap measure and leave the person walking around 
    like they are in a fog. After a while, the human body becomes 
    acclimated to the meds and a different set is prescribed. That is not 
    a soultion. That is like sticking your finger in a leaking dike until 
    all your fingers are stuck in holes, yet more holes and leaks pop up. 
    We have to come up with a radical different way to treat clinical 
    depression. It is very apparent that what we are doing now is not 
    working. Until we know how the human brain works (we are gaining 
    ground, but not fast enough), there will always be people who suffer 
    from clinical depression. I have witnessed the dreaded disease (and 
    it is a disease, not a &quot;condition&quot;) take the lives of two 
    loved ones, plus my Facebook friend Andy Copp. We have to try harder, 
    increase funding to come up with a cure and wipe out this dreaded 
    disease. Until we do, 117 people will take their lives every day. I 
    don't know about you, but that number is not acceptable to me. I know 
    people who rather not talk about depression, but it should be 
    discussed out in the open, including with children, so they can 
    understand the signs. If Robin Williams did one thing by taking his 
    life, it was bringing clinical depression out in the spotlight 
    (although I would still rather he be alive). Now is the time to 
    discuss it openly before the next big thing comes around and people 
    forget about clinical depression and what it can do to people. Mr. 
    William's wife also revealed that Robin was also suffering the early 
    stages of Parkinson's Disease, which probably put Mr. Williams over 
    the edge (And now every photo I see of Robin, all I see is sadness in 
    his eyes). Let's not let this awful opportunity pass us by without 
    coming up with some solutions for this disease and I hope the trolls 
    that made fun of Robin's death to his daughter Zelda on social media 
    sites, (including Twitter and Instagram), posting awful remarks and 
    Photoshopped photos of her father's death (which I won't describe 
    here due to the family wanting privacy; and a big &quot;Boo!' to the 
    Coroner's Office and Police Department for graphically telling the 
    Press the manner of Mr. William's death after the family begged for 
    privacy), all get caught and are punished accordingly. No child 
    should have to go through what poor Zelda did, but the Internet is 
    full of &quot;keyboard warriors' who are nothing but cowardly little 
    twerps. Zelda was forced to quit her accounts on these sites because 
    of those taunts and photos, proving once again that the internet is 
    full of both good and bad. But the bad overrides all the good 
    intentions with just one insensitive comment. Let's try and be more 
    understanding from now on. Suicide is never the answer, but until we 
    understand clinical depression and the way it screws with our brains, 
    there will be more. You can count on that. <B>UPDATE:</B> August 12, 
    2015: It has been a year since Robin Williams' suicide and platitudes 
    are coming from every star and friend that knew him, but nowhere did 
    I see any talk about trying to curb suicide. Yes, everyone is allowed 
    to have fond memories of their friends, but you would think the 
    manner of his death would be discussed seriously. And I have read 
    very little. And until we finally have a serious sit-down and discuss 
    the problem, there will be many more. And over the past year there 
    have been many deaths attributed to suicide, both famous and 
    not-so-famous. Let us make Robin Williams' death actually mean 
    something. Make a difference. I'm sure Robin Williams would want that 
    more than anything. Contrary to the old <B>M*A*S*H</B> song, suicide 
    isn't painless. It leaves many hurt people behind. But people that 
    take their own lives don't worry about such things because the 
    disease has taken over their mind. And, yes, it is a disease. Don't 
    let anyone tell you differently. Especially psychiatrists, who would 
    rather fill your body with mood stabilizers than get to the root of 
    the problem (Don't get me wrong, mood stabilizers work, but they are 
    not a permanent solution, as the human body builds up a resistance to 
    them). We actually need more people out there who actually CARE and 
    posting a Suicide Help Line phone number is not the answer (Most 
    people who seriously want to commit suicide don't care about such 
    things). Look for the signs and if you see them, sit down with the 
    person and offer all the help you can. Believe me, it makes a world 
    of difference. <B>SIDE NOTE:</B> Jim Carrey's girlfriend, Cathriona 
    White, committed suicide by taking prescription meds on September 28, 
    2015. Police discovered that the names on the prescription bottles (a 
    drug sleep aid, a pain killer and blood pressure medication) were an 
    alias that Jim Carrey has used in the past and all the prescriptions 
    were written by the same doctor. If Carrey had anything to do with 
    supplying her with those prescriptions, he should be charged with 
    assisted suicide. Jim Carrey has long been known to have bi-polar 
    disorder, but that is no excuse if he obtained the medication for 
    her. If she stole them from Carrey, my apologies, but why use an 
    alias in the first place? Being a celebrity is no excuse for that 
    behavior and doctors should not enable that behavior. It's fraud, 
    plain and simple. It's no different than stealing a doctor's 
    prescription pad and writing your own medication scripts. I've always 
    been a proponent that pharmacists should ask for ID before handing 
    over filled prescriptions. It would stop a lot of overdoses and 
    suicides. <B>UPDATE:</B> September 2016: White's estranged husband is 
    suing Carrey for being complicit in his wife's suicide and also 
    accused Carrey of giving his estranged wife Herpes Type 1, Herpes 
    Type 2 (genital herpes) and gonorrhea. Carrey denies the allegations, 
    but got himself a lawyer anyway, saying that White's&nbsp; estranged <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/jim carrey easter 2017 photo small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Jim Carrey looks particularly grungy and guilty in this Easter 2017 (March 16) selfie." BORDER="0">husband
     is trying to ruin his name. Really! I think Carrey has done a good 
    job of that all by himself. I believe Carrey is guilty (all he has to 
    do is take a blood test to prove his innocence, something he refuses 
    to do) and hope he is ruined for life and serves some jail time. <B>UPDATE
     #2:</B> October 11, 2016: The mother of Jim Carrey&#145;s 
    ex-girlfriend says she is willing to drop her wrongful death suit 
    blaming the comedian for her daughter&#146;s suicide if Carrey 
    releases the results of an alleged STD test to the public. Brigid 
    Sweetman, the mother of Cathriona White, told <A HREF="http://www.thewrap.com">TheWrap</A> 
    in a statement: &#147;Jim Carrey and his attorney have told the world 
    that Carrey has never had STDs and he has never tested positive for 
    STDs. They have called me and Mark &#145;shams&#146; for claiming 
    otherwise. I am demanding they immediately release the full 2013 lab 
    results so people can judge for themselves who is telling the truth 
    and who is lying. If they publicly release and publish the full Quest 
    Diagnostics lab report for the blood sample Carrey gave on January 
    28, 2013 at 11:40 a.m. under the name &#145;Jose Lopez&#146; and if 
    it shows Carrey did not test positive for STDs, I will immediately 
    dismiss the case and apologize. But if it shows differently, and it 
    will, then Carrey and his attorney must admit they have lied to the 
    media and the public. The public has a right to know when they have 
    been lied to.&#148; I will keep you advised on what Jim Carrey does, 
    but it looks like he is in some legal and financial trouble. <B>UPDATE
     #3:</B> October 18, 2016: Brigid Sweetman released a statement 
    Tuesday October 18. 2016, calling Carrey a &#147;complete liar&#148; 
    for not producing the test results. &#147;One week ago, I offered to 
    drop my case against Jim Carrey if he released his STD test from 2013 
    and it showed he was clean as he has told the world,&#148; Sweetman 
    said in a statement released by her attorney. &#147;He has refused to 
    release the test, which shows he is a complete liar and cannot be 
    trusted to be honest with the public and the media in this case.&#148;
     Sweetman&#146;s lawsuit alleges that Carrey contributed to 
    White&#146;s 2015 suicide by providing her with drugs and 
    transmitting multiple STDs to her without telling her he was 
    infected. &#147;Jim Carrey should be ashamed of what he did to my 
    daughter. And he should be ashamed for how he has used his Hollywood 
    attorneys to badmouth Cat&#146;s husband Mark with the hope that 
    nobody will hold him responsible for what he did,&#148; Sweetman said 
    in a statement after filing the lawsuit. The complaint goes on to 
    claim that Carrey tested positive for multiple STDs in 2013, using 
    the name Jose Gomez for the tests. White&#146;s estranged husband, 
    Mark Burton, has made similar allegations in a separate wrongful 
    death lawsuit. Carrey's lawyer went on the record to say: &#147;It is 
    understandable that a mother who has lost a daughter will look for 
    someone to blame. But in directing her grief and rage at Jim Carrey 
    and joining this ridiculous lawyer&#146;s attempt to capitalize on 
    Cathriona&#146;s suicide, Mrs. Sweetman is heading down the same dark 
    path as Cathriona&#146;s green-card &#145;husband,&#146; Mark 
    Burton,&#148; Singer said. &#147;On her 30th birthday, just a few 
    days before her suicide, Cathriona White was distraught having 
    received a message from her mother through Facebook that was so 
    destructive and demoralizing that she instantly deleted her Facebook 
    account so her mother could no longer contact her,&#148; Singer 
    added. &#147;Cathriona often lamented about her contentious 
    relationship with her mother, how she was forced to leave home at the 
    age of 15, and how they had been estranged for years.&#148; Too bad 
    Carrey's lawyer failed to mention what her mother wrote, why Carrey 
    won't release his medical records and why Carrey hired Private 
    Detectives to dig up dirt on his dead girlfriend's family. Those are 
    the actions of a guilty man. <B>UPDATE #4:</B> Jim Carrey Will Face 
    Trial Over Death Of Girlfriend Cathriona White. Her mother and 
    ex-husband are taking Carrey to court. White&#146;s family is now 
    suing Carrey claiming the Hollywood actor was complicit in the 
    30-year-old's suicide. I hope Carrey loses and spends the rest of his 
    days as a pauper. He is a total shit and a liar.<B>UPDATE #5:</B> 
    February 1, 2018: The wrongful death lawsuit filed against Jim Carrey 
    has been dismissed in a court of law. Once again, celebrity trumps 
    the truth. <B>SIDE NOTE #2</B>: October 26, 2015: Actor and model Sam 
    Sarpong, known for co-hosting MTV&#146;s <B>YO MAMMA</B> (2006 - 
    2007) with Wilmer Valderrama, died Monday, his rep confirmed. He was 
    40. Sarpong died after jumping off a bridge in Pasadena, Calif., 
    according to E! News. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical 
    Examiner-Coroner has ruled his death a suicide, with an autopsy 
    pending. Seriously, how many people have to die before we take this 
    suicide situation with the attention it deserves?. It happens a lot 
    more than you think, especially among reality show participants who 
    no longer have their 15 minutes of fame. <B>TROUBLING SIDE NOTE:</B> 
    January 8, 2016: What troubles me about the horror film </FONT></FONT><A HREF="forest_2015.htm"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>THE
     FOREST</B></FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> 
    (2015), which opened as the #4 film of the weekend, the main theme of 
    the film is that of suicide and it doesn't show it as the troubling 
    trend that it is today. Aokigahara, known as the Suicide Forest or 
    Sea of Trees is a 35-square-kilometer forest lying at the north-west 
    base of Mount Fuji in Japan. The forest has an association with 
    demons in Japanese mythology, and is a common suicide site (Japan has 
    more suicides per capita than any other country and it is common for 
    students not doing well in school to kill themselves, usually by 
    hanging because they are ashamed of facing their parents); a sign at 
    the start of the main trail urges suicidal visitors to contact a 
    suicide prevention association. Japan did not give the production 
    permission to film at the actual forest out of respect to the 
    families, so the film had to use another forest in Serbia, but we 
    must learn that even though nothing should be off-limits, there is 
    such a thing called respect and some people should learn how to use 
    it. Especially filmmakers. Don't use suicide as a plot device. Too 
    many good people have died because they suffer from depression, a 
    legitimate disease and using it to make a horror film is just bad 
    taste. Japan did right by its suicide victims, but this film does 
    nothing but perpetrate the myth of the psychology of the deadly 
    practice, especially in the first third of the movie. Besides, it's a 
    PG-13 Rated hunk of junk that will disappear from the top 20 after 
    the first week. Suicide is never a good subject for a horror film, 
    but it should be discussed seriously with your kids and other family 
    members. Films like this make it seem that suicide victims haunt 
    people. They do, but not in the way this film portrays them. Let's 
    just be more responsible and cognizant of the fact that there are 
    families out there still suffering from suicidal relatives or 
    friends. <B>SIDE NOTE #3:</B> March 26, 2017: Clay Adler, former star 
    of MTV's now defunct <B>NEWPORT HARBOR: THE REAL ORANGE COUNTY</B> 
    committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. He was just 27 
    years old. I believe we should take a long hard look about what 
    reality shows do to the psyche of the participants when the show is 
    over. There are just too many suicides associated with reality shows, 
    yet we just report them and forget about it. Time for action, not 
    inaction. <B>SIDE NOTE #4:</B> May 17, 2017: Chris Cornell, the 
    former front man of Soundgarden (and one of the chief architects of 
    grunge music) and member of the musical group Audioslave, whose music 
    was heard on countless Theatrical Films and TV Series, committed 
    suicide by hanging in Detroit while on a concert tour with 
    Soundgarden. He was nominated for a Golden Globe&reg; for Best 
    Original Song - Motion Picture (&quot;The Keeper&quot;) in 2012 from 
    the film <B><A HREF="machine_gun_preacher_2011.htm">MACHINE GUN PREACHER</A></B>.
     He was found unresponsive in Detroit and pronounced dead. Another 
    life taken away from us. Chris Cornell was 52 years-old. <B>SIDE NOTE #5:</B> 
    My condolences go out to film director Zack Snyder and his wife. One 
    of their eight children, Autumn Snyder, committed suicide on March 
    20, 2017 at the age of 20. The list of suicides per day has risen 
    from 117 in 2014 to 129 in 2016. Things are getting worse because our 
    President just doesn't care. <B>SIDE NOTE #6:</B> July 20, 2017: 
    Chester Bennington, the frontman of the band Linkin Park, committed 
    suicide by hanging. He was just 41 years old. No one knows at the 
    moment why he did it (It was on Chris Cornell's birthday and he sang 
    Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot; at Cornell's memorial 
    service.), but the band released a &quot;Pop&quot; album called 
    called &quot;One More Light&quot; in May 2017 which was unlike any 
    album released by the band. There is a song called &quot;Heavy&quot; 
    on that album that is one of the best songs Linkin Park has ever done 
    (They were playing a concert in France and when they got done playing 
    their most famous song, &quot;In The End&quot;, Bennington started 
    singing &quot;Heavy&quot; and someone in the crowd threw a gallon jug 
    of water at him. They didn't want to hear Linkin Park sing Pop songs, 
    but it will go down as one of the band's best songs.). If you listen 
    to the lyrics of that song, it may give you clues on why Bennington 
    took his own life. Another life needlessly wasted. <B>SIDE NOTE #7:</B> 
    September 15, 2017: Michelle Rounds, Rosie O&#146;Donnell&#146;s 
    ex-wife, has died at age 46. TMZ reports that Rounds died Monday by 
    apparent suicide. &#147;I am saddened to hear about this terrible 
    tragedy,&#148; O&#146;Donnell said in a statement. &#147;Mental 
    illness is a very serious issue affecting many families. My thoughts 
    and prayers go out to Michelle&#146;s family, her wife and their 
    child.&#148; O&#146;Donnell and Rounds married in New York in June 
    2012, and they announced in January 2013 that they had adopted a baby 
    girl, Dakota. AS you can plainly see Mental Illness has no bias It 
    attacks nearly everyone and suicide is sometimes the only answer in 
    their minds. Why haven't we brought this subject out into the open? <B>SIDE
     NOTE #8:</B> March 04, 2019: Today, Keith Flint, lead singer of The 
    Prodigy (&quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot;, &quot;Firestarter&quot;), 
    died, his death has been ruled a suicide as a result of hanging. Why 
    do singers think that suicide is the answer? It isn't. We lost Chris 
    Cornell and Chester Bennington to suicide in 2017 and I'm still 
    hurting from that. Nothing should be so bad that suicide is the 
    answer. It is the coward's way out. Suicide doesn't just affect the 
    person who commits it. It affects everyone, from their family to 
    their fans. Unfortunately, he passed away the same day Luke Perry 
    died of a heart attack at the age of 52, giving his death less press 
    than was necessary. Isn't it about time we seriously study why famous 
    people believe suicide is the answer?</FONT></FONT></P>

    based on his 2006 film <B><A HREF="shooter_2006.htm">SHOOTER</A></B>, 
    with Ryan Phillippe subbing for Mark Wahlberg. It debuts during the 
    Summer of 2016. <B>NOTE:</B> July 6, 2016: Actor Tom Sizemore injured 
    stuntman Steve DeCastro when he backed up a SUV he was driving during 
    a filmed scene, running over the stuntman, something he was not 
    supposed to do. The crew had to use machinery to lift the SUV off of 
    Mr. DeCastro and copter him to a hospital. A paramedic described his 
    injuries as &quot;moderate&quot; and not life-threatening. &quot;There
     were no broken bones &#150; just bumps and bruises,&quot; Makes you 
    wonder if Sizemore still has a drug problem? <B>UPDATE:</B> October 
    28, 2016: Stuntman Steve DeCastro has filed a lawsuit against 
    Sizemore, Viacom, Paramount and others &#151; for a host of claims 
    including negligence, battery, assault and intentional infliction of 
    emotional distress because Tom Sizemore was drunk when behind the 
    wheel of the SUV that ran him over. The fact that the producers knew 
    he was drunk offers DeCastro a heavy payday if the charges are true 
    (Paramount refused to fire Sizemore and less than two weeks after the 
    accident was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence). I hope 
    Steve DeCastro takes Tom Sizemore to the cleaners. He's going to kill 
    someone if he remains an active actor and was given more than enough 
    chances to clean himself up. <B>NOTE #2:</B> The premiere of the 
    series was moved from July 19, 2016 to July 26, 2016 in wake of the 
    July 7, 2016 shooting deaths of five police officers in Dallas, 
    Texas. Advance reviews for the series have been terrible, which is 
    probably why USA didn't send me screeners. <B>UPDATE #2:</B> July 18, 
    2016: USA has moved the series to sometime in the Fall (November 15, 
    2016), in the wake of all the violence happening across the world. 
    While I usually look down on actions like this (it makes TV Shows 
    look responsible for real-life violence), I applaud USA for making a 
    correct decision this time considering the series' plot. <B>UPDATE #3:</B> 
    On December 19, 2016, USA announced that the series has been renewed 
    for a Second Season. <B>NOTE #4:</B> July 18, 2017: Ryan Phillippe 
    was hospitalized for a broken leg due to a &#147;freak accident&#148; 
    away from set on the Second Season of the series. The injury is 
    expected to force adjustments to the production schedule of the USA 
    drama, but no delays. Phillippe broke his leg during a freak accident 
    while having a family picnic! The Second Season will only be 8 
    episodes instead of 10.; The Sony-backed streaming channel Crackle 
    has green-lit a <A HREF="snatch_tv_series_2017.htm">series</A> based

    star, Brad Pitt, hard to understand fast-talking accent (the answer 
    is no, since he will be playing a different part), which were the 
    funniest parts of the film? Both Jason Statham and the late Dennis 
    Farina also proved in the film that they could be funny, as well as 
    Statham being a great action film fighter. Ed Westwick will also star 
    in the series. The series, based on real-life events, premieres in 
    March 2017.; Hulu has created a <A HREF="handmaids_tale_hulu_series_2017.htm">new

     DIARIES</A></B> ends in the 2016 - 2017 TV Season. Word is the the 
    new series is slated to run seven seasons, with each season taking up 
    a decade of time. Sounds interesting, but I'll reserve my opinion 
    when I actually view the first episode, which should start in the 
    2017 - 2018 TV Season. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not against any of 
    this. It just seems like it is happening much faster than normal. 
    Which makes me wonder: Is there going to be any original programming 
    on TV, including streaming and pay cable? I remember when watching TV 
    every night was a pleasure (especially in the 70's, but I'm dating 
    myself). Now it is becoming more like a job. We already have a job. 
    Do we actually want another one? I have to watch these programs, but 
    you do not have to. The things I do for my readers! Wait for the 2015 
    - 2016 TV reviews and see how many new shows aren't superhero 
    oriented. Superheroes and remakes. That is what TV is coming to. Why 
    take a show like <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESITGATION</A></B> 
    off the air to make space for a low-rated show called <B><A HREF="supergirl_tv_series_2015.htm">SUPERGIRL</A></B>?
     (Which will be moving to The CW for its Second Season). CBS was the 
    only holdout with superhero shows, rather skewering to audiences my 
    age, but even they have now gone to the dark side after years of 
    excellent crime and scientific procedural shows (Remember <B><A HREF="cold_case_tv_series_2003-2010.htm">COLD
     CASE</A></B>? [How many times did that show make you cry? Be a 
    man/woman and confess!] Or <B><A HREF="without_a_trace_tv_series_2002-2009.htm">WITHOUT

     How about <B><A HREF="mentalist_tv_series.htm">THE MENTALIST</A></B>?).
     The CW is full of superheroes, I gave up watching the Disney-owned 
    ABC because they would find sneaky ways of inserting promos of their 
    superhero films (even using dialogue in their network shows) and I 
    quit watching <B><A HREF="hawaii_five_0_new_tv_series.htm">HAWAII FIVE-O</A></B> 
    on CBS because of their obvious Subway ad disguised as a conversation 
    (It was so blatant, it was shameful) and their &quot;special 
    appearances&quot; by &quot;Dog The Bounty Hunter and Beth&quot; who 
    get to act more violent in this show than they did their own, even 
    calling their prey &quot;scumbags&quot;. Yes, we may be in the Golden 
    Age of Television now, but there are quite a few series that sink to 
    the depths of sewers to go along with it (Some channels even go as 
    far as to digitally insert products into their series. Depending on 
    your location or demographics, you may see a can of Coke or Pepsi 
    digitally inserted on a table, among other products. There is no 
    length advertisers will go to to sell their products. In 1981, <B><A HREF="looker_1981.htm">LOOKER</A></B> 
    was science fiction. Now it is science fact.). And let's not forget 
    that many internet sites are full of ads. If a home page takes more 
    than 30 seconds to load (mine takes about 5 seconds because I refuse 
    to accept ads) or if an ad pops up full page while I am reading a 
    story, those sites are deleted from my Favorites List. Thank God for 
    streaming services picking up the quality shows (you know, the great 
    shows that nobody watches, except me and a few million other people) 
    and rescuing them from oblivion. I'm not the biggest fan of 
    streaming, but I'll take my favorite shows (like <B><A HREF="longmire_tv_series_2012.htm">LONGMIRE</A></B>)
     any way I can get them. If this is the new way of advertising (and I 
    see it happen all the time on cable shows, too [and even on some pay 
    channels, which is unforgivable and I have quit subscribing to 
    them].), I may just quit watching TV shows and wait for them to 
    arrive on disc. How much do you want to bet that commercials start 
    turning up on DVD and Blu-Rays? (They did on VHS tapes in the waning 
    days of the product). They already turn up in theaters and on 
    streaming channels like Crackle and Hulu (You can pay monthly fees 
    for both streaming channels to get the programs with no commercials 
    or ads). Maybe if no one watches TV, advertizers will get the hint 
    (For Christ's sake, I saw five commercial breaks on Spike for every 
    half hour episode of <B><A HREF="cops_tv_series_1989.htm">COPS</A></B>!).
     But my guess is that they will come up with a new way to advertize, 
    even if it means jacking into our own brains. Believe me, <B><A HREF="idiocracy_2006.htm">IDIOCRACY</A></B> 
    (2006) is not far behind. I could grab my TV remote right now and go 
    through all the non-pay channels. About 80% of them will be showing 
    commercials. That not only makes me mad, it makes me sad. When a 90 
    minute film takes up 150 minutes to be shown on regular TV, you do 
    the math and tell me that advertisers are not taking over TV. And 
    99.9% of the time, the film is edited due to &quot;time restraints, 
    language and violence&quot;! Maybe that is why streaming is becoming 
    more and more popular. But don't get too cozy. The advertizers are on 
    your tail trying to figure out how to intrude on your privacy. There 
    really is no escape unless the FCC clamps down on how many 
    commercials could be shown per hour. When I was a kid, it wasn't 
    unusual for an hour program to run 52 to 54 minutes (for proof, look 
    at the running times of the original <B><A HREF="outer_limits_tv_series_1963.htm">THE
     OUTER LIMITS</A></B>). Now an hour program runs 42 to 44 minutes. 
    That's ten extra minutes of commercials! I can't even watch a rerun 
    of <B><A HREF="outer_limits_a_feasibility_study_1964.htm">THE OUTER LIMITS</A></B> 
    on SyFy because there's at least 11 minutes of the show missing! 
    Syndication Rights reruns allow for an extra 2 minutes of editing per 
    half hour [see what you can find missing on reruns of <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE
     SIMPSONS</A></B> in syndication) and 4 minutes of editing per hour 
    and I have noticed it on shows as recent as <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B> on the USA Network. Maybe that is why 
    people are turning to streaming to watch reruns. They don't have to 
    follow the FCC (for now). Now you can get <B><A HREF="seinfeld_tv_series.htm">SEINFELD</A></B> 
    unedited on Hulu [they paid $150 million for exclusive streaming 
    rights] with limited commercials or no commercials (it depends on 
    what plan you pick, but each option gives you the full episode as it 
    was originally shown on NBC). Hulu has also picked up exclusive 
    streaming rights for over 300 episodes of the original <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI:
     CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION</A></B>, uncut and unedited. You will 
    never see that on TV because it is all about the ad dollars. The only 
    problem I have with streaming is that internet speeds haven't caught 
    up with high definition, so HD shows and movies are very compressed, 
    so stick with standard definition until the internet speeds improve. 
    That will happen in less than a year, but expect to pay a lot for the 
    privilege. FIOS already offers a super high speed internet, but it 
    costs an extra $100 per month and that doesn't include tv or phone 
    service! Plus their service sucks. My service, Optimum Online, offers 
    4 tiers of internet speeds, with their 101 Service the highest speed.

    has been given the dreaded NC-17 rating not once but twice by the 
    MPAA! Zombie, who took to Facebook with the news, is attempting to 
    edit it a third time to go for an R-rating, although he&#146;s none 
    too pleased about it. &#147;Well, after two tries through the MPAA 
    our rating on <B>31</B> remains NC-17,&#148; Zombie explained. 
    &#147;Maybe three is the charm to get an R rating. Why R you ask? 
    Well, because your local theater will not show an NC-17. Even though 
    you are a fucking adult... things [must] be censored for your 
    enjoyment.&#148; The MPAA rated <B>31</B> NC-17 for &#147;sadistic 
    graphic violence, bizarre sexuality/nudity, pervasive disturbing 
    images and some strong language.&#148; Yup, sounds like a Rob Zombie 
    film! In <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#T31-2016">31</A></B>,
     which will have its World Premiere at the Sundance Film Festival In 
    January 2016, &#147;Five friends are kidnapped on the day before 
    Halloween and are held hostage in a terrifying place named Murder 
    World. While trapped, they must play a violent game called 31, in 
    which the mission is to survive 12 hours against a gang of evil 
    clowns.&#148; The Halloween-themed slasher stars Sheri Moon Zombie, 
    Malcolm McDowell, Richard Brake, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, Jeff Daniel 
    Phillips, and even Meg Foster.</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">(Yet,
     if this film were to have been submitted by a huge major film 
    company, it would have had no trouble receiving an R-Rating on its 
    first try. The MPAA shows its double standard once again. And won't 
    it be great to see Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs on the big screen again? 
    The film also stars Tracey Walter, Lew Temple [his third Zombie 
    film], Daniel Roebuck, Judy Geeson, Ginger Lynn and Elizabeth Daily. 
    As usual, Rob Zombie packs his films with stars we haven't seen for a 
    while. I will see this in a theater [if it goes that route and not 
    the limited theater/VOD round] and hopefully the Blu-Ray &amp; DVD 
    will be the full uncensored version. The MPAA has nothing to do with 
    disc releases. Zombie has stated publicly that this is his most

    is exiting the CBS drama after 13 seasons, many internet sites 
    confirm. The actor will make his final appearance as Special Agent 
    Tony DiNozzo at the end of this season. &#147;After 13 years on NCIS, 
    Michael Weatherly is leaving the show at the end of this season,&#148;
     reads a statement from CBS. &#147;He is a valued part of the CBS 
    family, and the immense charm and talent he brings to the screen as 
    &#145;Very&#146; Special Agent Tony DiNozzo has helped make NCIS what 
    it is today &#150; the No. 1 drama in the world. &#147;We thank 
    Michael for all of his contributions to this successful 
    franchise,&#148; the statement continues, &#147;and look forward to 
    continuing to develop projects with him as part of our ongoing 
    development deal.&#148; Weatherly immediately responded, sharing on 
    Twitter, &#147;DiNozzo is a wonderful, quixotic character and I 
    couldn&#146;t have had more fun playing him over the past 13 
    seasons.... (CBS Corp. CEO) Les Moonves and CBS gave me the 
    opportunity of a lifetime. I will miss the amazing crew and cast, who 
    are like family to me, and to the fans all over the world &#151; 
    THANK YOU, it&#146;s been a fantastic ride!&#148; David McCallum, who 
    plays Ducky, let slip about Weatherly&#146;s exit in a Q&amp;A with 
    the UK&#146;s Vulture Hound magazine, saying, &#147;DiNozzo, played 
    by Michael Weatherly... is leaving at the end of the season. So the 
    writers have to decide what to do when one of the four members of the 
    original cast leaves.&#148; McCallum and Weatherly, along with 
    frontman Mark Harmon and Pauley Perrette, represent the well-watched 
    drama&#146;s remaining original players. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">(Well,
     as far as I'm concerned, <B>NCIS</B> is over. Not taking anything 
    away from the excellent Mark Harmon and the rest of the cast, Michael 
    Weatherly was the comic and romantic backbone of the show. I hope 
    they kill him off, because this series has not been shy about killing 
    off major and supporting characters [Think about all of them, 
    especially Caitlin Todd getting shot in the forehead by sniper Ari. 
    There has also been the deaths of NCIS Director Jenny Shepard, Mike 
    Franks, who called Leroy Jethro Gibbs &quot;Probie&quot;, Leon 
    Vance's wife, Probationary Agent Ned Dorneget and a few others. Let's 
    not forget about the real-life death of Ralph Waite, who played 
    Gibbs' father on the series, which turned out to be one of the 
    series' most emotional episodes. After 13 seasons, there has been 
    plenty of deaths of characters we've become to know and love, much 
    more than any other series, but the series still thrived. Ziva David 
    leaving the show {after killing her own brother to save Gibbs' life} 
    was bad enough, but take Weatherly out of the picture and the show 
    becomes much, much different. Maybe too different to survive.]. After 
    13 years, people have grown use to his sexual hijinks, obscure movie 
    references and sometimes saving the day, so there can be no one who 
    can take his place. I predict the U.S. #1 scripted drama will drop 
    heavily in the ratings next season. The show is not <B>NCIS</B> 
    without DiNozzo, who was with the show since the beginning. Michael 
    Weatherly should have no problem getting film or TV work. We can 
    probably scratch out money for being the reason he is leaving. I am 
    sure after 13 years, he made a pretty good salary. I think he wants 
    to spread his wings and try something different. He must have had to 
    turn down many roles due to his committment to the TV series. Either 
    way, good luck Michael Weatherly. Maybe it is time for <B>NCIS</B> to 
    bow out gracefully. There are still two other <B>NCIS</B> shows on 
    the air that could play back-to-back in the same time slots. I miss 
    the headslaps and appearances by Robert Wagner already. - Editor)</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> <B>NOTE:</B> 
    CBS has given <B>NCIS</B> a two season renewal to show its support 
    for the series (and gave Mark Harmon a huge raise in pay) and added 
    Wilmer Valderrama (the 2015 bomb series <B><A HREF="minority_report_tv_series_2015.htm">MINORITY
     REPORT</A></B>) and Jennifer Esposito (TV's <B><A HREF="blue_bloods_tv_series_2010.htm">BLUE
     BLOODS</A></B>) to the cast. Whether it works or not remains to be 
    seen. I doubt it will (even though Pauley Perrette, Sean Murray, 
    David McCallum and Rocky Carroll signed deals for Seasons 14 and 15). 
    Also, Michael Weatherly has signed on to star in a pilot for CBS 
    called <B><A HREF="bull_tv_series_2016.htm">BULL</A></B> (which has 
    gone to series during the 2016-2017 season, airing right after <B>NCIS</B>),
     which is based on Dr. Phil McGraw&#146;s early career. Weatherly has 
    been cast as Dr. Bull, the lead in the pilot, who is inspired by the 
    talk show host, during his days as head of one of the most prolific 
    trial consulting services of all time. His character is described as 
    having a physicality and feral intelligence that make him magnetic to 
    women and a bruising candor. He is the head of a company that 
    analyzes juries to help develop defense strategies. Sounds like a 
    stinker to me. Dr. Phil is one of the worst celebrities on TV. He 
    lost his license to practice psychiatry in Texas (Google him to find 
    out why) and berates people with his &quot;Dr. Philisms&quot;, which 
    sometimes do more harm than good. Plus, he is really good friends 
    with one of the worst racists on TV, Oprah Winfrey (Yes, black people 
    can be racists, too.). Anyone associated with that bitch (Ooh, one 
    time she gave her whole audience cars! But what wasn't reported is 
    that every audience member had to pay high taxes on the cars and a 
    lot of them returned the cars because they couldn't afford the 
    taxes.) is a complete moron in my opinion.</FONT></FONT></P>

     Channel in new episodes or repeats unless he is found not guilty of 
    the charges (which I doubt he will). Sure as hell he won't be an 
    employee at Rick and the Old Man's Las Vegas pawn shop any time in 
    the near future (or at all). This is what reality TV does to people. 
    They either think they can do things that us normal humans can't or 
    commit suicide when their 15 minutes of fame is over. ChumLee has 
    proven on the show that he was a pretty good marksman, but doing 
    drugs (except for weed; he always seemed stoned) and sexually 
    attacking women was really a surprise. It just goes to show that 
    editing is the major tool for these reality shows to hide people's 
    darker sides (or to bring them out, whether true or not). Sorry to 
    say that I will never look at ChumLee the same again. Marijuana is a 
    nothing crime to me, but he was also found with a big amount of 
    methamphetamines (which would explain his massive weight loss 
    recently). That is very serious. He hasn't been charged with sexual 
    assault (yet), but if he is, his TV career is over. People are 
    willing to forgive drug offences, but sexually attacking a woman 
    usually never gets a pass (unless you're Mike Tyson). Time for all 
    this reality crap to end. It's &quot;scripted reality&quot; anyway. 
    None of it is real. If you think it is, you're an idiot. (In related 
    news: Rod Durham, a high school teacher who appeared on ABC&#146;s <B>EXTREME
     WEIGHT LOSS</B>, has died. He was 52. Local paper the Tallahassee 
    Democrat reported Durham was found during the weekend at a motel in 
    Fort Lauderdale, where he was visiting during spring break. Friends 
    told the paper he died of diabetic shock. Durham lost more than 180 
    pounds during Season 4 of the ABC reality series. Add up all the 
    suicides and deaths attributed to reality series and it looks like an 
    epidemic but, hey, they are cheap to produce, so what is a human life 
    being lost here and there?) ChumLee should just face the cameras and 
    tell the real truth. People are more forgiving when you admit you are 
    just human. <B>UPDATE:</B> Right now, Rick Harrison, the owner of the 
    pawn shop, is backing and standing behind ChumLee, but if The History 
    Channel puts pressure on him, he will have no choice but to either 
    give up his show (so far, THC is still airing the show.) or give up 
    supporting ChumLee. I hate nice guys being put in Catch-22 situations 
    like that and I am sure ChumLee feels the same way. People are making 
    it a big deal that a stripper pole was found in one of his rooms, but 
    that is none of our business. What he does in the privacy of his own 
    home (as long as it is legal) is none of our business. I hate 
    organizations that think &quot;celebrities&quot; (even a minor one 
    like ChumLee) lives are open books (I'm looking at you, the scumbags 
    at TMZ). They deserve the same privacy as you and me. And besides, it 
    is Las Vegas. You don't want me to repeat the city's motto, do you? 
    Personally, I hope ChumLee bounces back. Everyone deserves a second 
    chance. <B>UPDATE #2</B>: Police also found twelve guns (eight which 
    were unregistered) and lots of pot locked in a vault, Xanax, a scale, 
    drug paraphenalia (including a rolled up $1 bill with white residue 
    on it.), lots of small plastic bags used for distribution and think 
    he may also be a drug dealer. The woman that charged him with sexual 
    assault works at the same pawn shop ChumLee does (or did). He has not 
    been arrested on that charge (yet) but the 33-year-old (who confessed 
    to the police that he smokes a lot of weed) was booked on 19 
    drug-possession charges and one weapon charge. ChumLee posted $62,000 
    bail and was released from jail pending a May 23, 2016 court date. 
    Not looking too good for him but, luckily, the series wasn't filming 
    at the time. <B>UPDATE #3</B>: May 23, 2016: Austin Russell has plead 
    guilty in Las Vegas to attempted possession of a controlled 
    substance. He was given three years&#146; probation on the 
    misdemeanor charge but will avoid jail time. He also was facing a 
    felony count of ownership or possession of a firearm by a prohibited 
    person, but that charge will be stayed under the deal. Russell agreed 
    to attend counseling and forfeit property seized by Vegas police in a 
    March raid on his home. The gun charge will be dismissed if he 
    completes the terms of his probation. He will continue to appear on <B>PAWN

    film ends: When we last saw the three precogs (the people able to 
    predict future crime; the name of the film refers to when one of the 
    precogs differs from the other two), they were sequestered away on a 
    peaceful island and the concept of predicting crimes of the future 
    and arresting people before they were able to commit them has been 
    outlawed. In the series, it is still outlawed, but the three precogs 
    escape from their island and one of them, named Dash (played by Stark 
    Sands) teams up with a female cop Lara Vega (Meagan Good) to use his 
    powers to predict crimes while Vega tries to hide her success rate 
    from her boss Will Blake (played by a very bad Wilmer Valderrama), 
    since the use of precogs to make arrests is in itself against the 
    law. It's all very ordinary and I predict it will be one of the first 
    cancellations of the season since there is only the precog angle to 
    separate it from all the other cop shows on the air. Sure, there is 
    some nifty new technology on view and it follows the cushy timeslot 
    after the surprise hit <B><A HREF="gotham_tv_series_2014.htm">GOTHAM</A></B> 
    from last year, but I think people are smart enough to realize that 
    there are better ways to spend your time on TV. Unless future 
    episodes rapidly increase in entertainment value (I was only sent a 
    screener of the first episode), this series doesn't stand a chance of 
    staying on the air. I'll bet you that people will stay with last 
    year's hit <B><A HREF="scorpion_tv_series_2014.htm">SCORPION</A></B> 
    on CBS, which occupies the same time period. You don't need to be a 
    precog to know that. (<B>NOTE:</B> The first episode was the real 
    loser of the night for FOX, getting panned by critics and opening to 
    only 3.1 million viewers and 1.1 demo rating. If this wasn't a Steven 
    Spielberg series, it would have already been cancelled. Expect this 
    series to end up on the digital garbage bin in a few weeks. <B>NOTE #2:</B> 
    FOX cut the number of episodes from a full season to 10 episodes. 
    Looks like cancellation time to me.) <B>*</B> NBC's <B><A HREF="blindspot_tv_series_2015.htm">BLINDSPOT</A></B> 
    (Mondays 10:00pm). Here's one that I predict will become one of the 
    highest-rated TV series of the new season, thanks to some slam-bang 
    action set pieces (that rival anything you may see in theatrical 
    films) and a true sense of mystery. It all begins with a naked woman 
    being dropped off in Times Square in a large duffel bag, her body 
    covered in newly inked tattoos (much like in the Summer series <B><A HREF="whispers_tv_series_2015.htm">THE
     WHISPERS</A></B>, which will not be back for a second season), the 
    most obvious of them being &quot;Kurt<A HREF="blindspot_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blindspot 2015 series premiere tv ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Weller FBI&quot; on her upper back. The woman, whom the FBI dubs 
    &quot;Jane Doe&quot; (Jaimie Alexander), has no idea who she is or 
    how the tattoos got on her body, thanks to being dosed with a 
    memory-erasing drug. When it turns out that Kurt Weller (Sullivan 
    Stapleton) is an actual FBI Agent, he joins forces with Jane Doe, not 
    only to find out her true identity (she definitely had military 
    training, because she can kick butt and handle firearms like few men 
    can), but to unravel the meaning of the tattoos that covers her body. 
    Much like <B>MINORITY REPORT</B> (but done with more panache and it 
    would be fair to say that this series was influenced by Ray 
    Bradbury's &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot;, which was turned into a 
    movie in <A HREF="illustrated_man_1969.htm">1969 starring Rod Steiger</A>),
     each tattoo has it's own meaning to a corresponding crime (or the 
    person that is the perpetrator or victim) that has not happened yet. 
    They team together to stop the crimes from happening. The true 
    mystery of this series is who or what covered this woman with tattoos 
    and how do they know these crimes will happen in the future? This is 
    the most theatrical-looking series that I have ever seen on TV and 
    you'll be amazed at some of the action scenes. I won't spoil the 
    ending of the first episode (I do advise that you watch closely for 
    clues to decode some of the tattoos in future episodes), but I'll bet 
    dollars to donuts that this is one show that you continue watching 
    every week. I definitely want to know who is behind all this and, 
    since I have seen the first three episodes, I think you'll want to 
    know, too. The best new series since <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE
     BLACKLIST</A></B> in 2013. Some of the uses for the tattoos on her 
    body in later episodes have been pure genius. Some tattoos can even 
    be used twice or more. (<B>NOTE:</B> The first episode opened to huge 
    numbers in the ratings [15.2 million viewers], guaranteeing that it 
    will last at least this season. <B>NOTE #2:</B> NBC gave the series a 
    full season pickup. It is the only new series to be in the Top Ten 
    most watched shows of the week. <B>NOTE #3:</B> November 9, 2015: NBC 
    has already renewed the series for a Second Season, but it will move 
    to Wednesday night.) <B>*</B> FOX's <B><A HREF="scream_queens_tv_series_2015.htm">SCREAM
     QUEENS</A></B> (Tuesdays 9:00pm; First episode: Tuesday 8:00pm - 
    10:00pm). Let me preface this review by stating that if Jamie Lee 
    Curtis came to my house right now, I would try my damndest to get her 
    into bed. She is one of the sexiest &quot;older&quot; actresses alive 
    and every time I see her, something excites me deep inside. OK, now 
    that that's out of the way, lets get on with the review. This is a 
    horror/comedy from Executive Producer Ryan Murphy, who is also in 
    charge of one of my favorite series <B><A HREF="american_horror_story_tv_series_2011.htm">AMERICAN

     this will be a 13-episode story arc that changes from 
    season-to-season. The first season is about a killer called the 
    &quot;Red Devil&quot; (dressed in a devil costume, no less!) killing 
    the female students at the Kappa Kappa Tau sorority (where, 20 years 
    earlier, a pledge had a baby in a bathtub at a sorority party [&quot;I
     thought it was just the freshman 15! I thought it was a bread 
    baby!&quot;] and was then murdered, the circumstances of her baby and 
    its sex still unknown) in various bloody ways (The first episode 
    carries a &quot;TV-PG&quot; Rating, but the gore goes way beyond that 
    rating; <B>NOTE:</B> The premiere two-hour episode was changed to a <A HREF="scream_queens_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/scream queens 2015 series premiere tv ad10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="306" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>TV-14
     rating when shown on TV. The screener was given the lower rating, 
    but I could spot no differences between the two. It does deserve the 
    higher rating, though.). Jamie Lee portrays &quot;Cathy Munsch&quot; 
    (no relation to &quot;John Munch&quot; of <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B>), the Dean of Wallace University, who has a 
    severe hatred of the Kappa Kappa Tau sorority (which will be 
    explained in future episodes), so she instates an &quot;open 
    policy&quot; where every girl that pledges that sorority gets the 
    chance to become a member, whether the sorority head Chanel Oberlin 
    (Emma Roberts, who calls Jamie Lee's character &quot;Dean Box 
    Munch&quot;) wants her or not. As long as the girls (and one gay guy, 
    played by Nick Jonas) applying make it through the rushes, they will 
    become members. My only problem with this series is Lea Michele (<B><A HREF="glee_tv_series_2009.htm">GLEE</A></B> 
    [2009 - 2015]), who portrays Hester Ulrich, a scoliosis-ridden (and 
    death-obsessed) girl who wears a neck brace in all her scenes. I 
    actually can't stand her acting technique, which makes her character 
    a walking clich&eacute; and it automatically makes you think that she 
    could be the killer. Luckily, every other character in the ensemble 
    has baggage of their own and skeletons in their closets, so anyone 
    could be the killer or a red herring (If you want to see Jamie Lee 
    smoking a joint after making love to a college student on probation 
    or Chad [Glen Powell], Chanel's boyfriend who is obsessed with death, 
    saying, &quot;I got my first boner watching <B><A HREF="faces_of_death_1978.htm">FACES
     OF DEATH</A></B>!&quot;, then this is the show for you). I generally 
    don't care for horror comedies, but Jamie Lee Curtis is able to pull 
    off some zingers with aplomb, some of which me made laugh out loud. I 
    don't remember a sitcom making me laugh this much (She's dead!&quot; 
    &quot;Of course she's dead, you burned her face off!&quot; or &quot;My
     parents couldn't even call me on my birthday because they were 
    hosting a fund raiser for Jeb Bush!&quot;), so this will be popular 
    with both slasher fanatics (the death by lawmower scene gets rid of a 
    pledge obsessed with Taylor Swift, so it is doing something right) 
    and people looking for some fun, as long as they don't mind dollops 
    of gore (and, yes, there will be blood!) and technology being used as 
    a major plot device. It is also refreshing that a black sorority 
    member named Zayday Williams (where do they come up with these 
    names?), portrayed by Keke Palmer, is the voice of reason (Here's a 
    tease: One of the actresses listed in the poster will die in the 
    premiere.). I predict that this series will have a long life and will 
    be one of the top-rated new series of the season. The third episode 
    of the season was really a standout, as the Red Devil dismembers a 
    Dicky Dollar Scholars sorority boy's arms with a chainsaw while The 
    Backstreet Boys' &quot;Everybody (Backstreet's Back)&quot; plays on 
    the soundtrack. It was pure inspiration. Another problem I have with 
    this series is Niecy Nash's terrible over-acting as the college 
    security guard who gives out an 800 phone number to call when there 
    is trouble because she is not allowed to carry a gun, but it's not 
    enough to make me quit watching this funny, inventive show. My second 
    favorite new series this season. (<B>NOTE:</B> Wow. This opened with 
    a measly 4 million viewers for the premiere episode. What is the 
    matter with people? It seems they would rather watch reality crap 
    like <B><A HREF="voice_tv_series_2011.htm">THE VOICE</A></B> than 
    quality scripted entertainment. But when multiplatform viewing is 
    included, the series grew by 80 percent to a total of 7.3 million 
    total viewers. That's much better. Maybe people DVR'd the show to 
    watch the two <B>NCIS</B> series that occupy the same time slot. The 
    World Series didn't help, either, as many people didn't know that 
    episode #7 was being shown early because the World Series only lasted 
    4 games. Even my TIVO didn't pick it up and they are usually good 
    about things like that.) <B>NOTE #2:</B> Leave it to the only one in 
    the cast I couldn't stand to be the final Red Devil (There were four 
    of them, but three were killed off). It just proves my theory: Give 
    someone a physical problem and they are automatically the killer (I 
    wonder if she will win an Emmy Award&reg; for this? Award shows love 
    people with disabilities.). A real disappointment of an ending. At 
    least the 12 episodes before it were entertaining. Word is out that 
    there will not be a Second Season. Let's hope FOX give this series a 
    second chance like they have been giving other series (the awful <B><A HREF="minority_report_tv_series_2015.htm">MINORITY
     REPORT</A></B> not included). <B>NOTE #3:</B> Yeah! FOX has given 
    the series a Second Season. No word on what it's going to be about 
    (except it will take place in a hospital and Niecy Nash and most of 
    the previous cast will return in the same roles), but I hope Jamie 
    Lee Curtis is involved (It seems she will be, which is good news.).<B> 
    NOTE #4:</B> John Stamos has joined the cast for Season 2 after his 
    sitcom <B><A HREF="grandfathered_tv_series_2015.htm">GRANDFATHERED</A></B> 
    was cancelled by the same network. Taylor Lautner &amp; Kirstie Alley 
    have also joined the cast. <B>*</B> Fox's <B><A HREF="rosewood_tv_series_2015.htm">ROSEWOOD</A></B> 
    (Wednesdays 8:00pm). Poor Morris Chestnut. He's a great actor trapped 
    in a series that will probably last 4 episodes at most because of the 
    hackneyed premise. Chestnut portrays the &#147;Beethoven of private 
    pathologists&#148; (Huh?), Miami's unofficial medical examiner Dr. 
    Beaumont Rosewood Jr. (people who know him call him<A HREF="rosewood_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/rosewood 2015 series premiere tv ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    &quot;Rosie&quot;), who has an incurable heart condition (he has two 
    holes in his heart) that could make him drop dead at any time (he 
    says he has 10 years to live, tops), so he lives every day like it is 
    his last. He becomes a crime-solving forensic pathologist (Hey, 
    didn't Jack Klugman do this over 35 years ago? Officially? Doesn't <B><A HREF="izombie_tv_series_2015.htm">iZOMBIE</A></B> 
    have a premise where a female zombie pathologist eats the brains of 
    the murder victims on her table to obtain their memories [a 
    scientific impossibility] to solve their murders? And what about last 
    year's failed <B><A HREF="forever_tv_series_2014.htm">FOREVER</A></B>,
     about a coroner who can live for eternity?) who is not afraid to 
    take chances in capturing criminals (in the first episode, he brings 
    down an armed criminal with nothing but a syringe full of Botox) with 
    the help of female Detective Annalise Villa (Jaina Lee Ortiz). What 
    are the bad guys going to do, kill him? He already has that hanging 
    over his head every day. And that is what is exactly wrong with this 
    series. It's hard to root for a character who could drop dead at any 
    moment (but we know he won't if the series continues) and has a huge 
    scar running from his upper chest to his stomach from where he 
    already suffered two heart attacks, one when he was a child and 
    another when he was in his twenties. I can just see a &quot;very 
    special episode&quot; where Rosie sufferes another heart attack and 
    the audience sits in silence hoping he survives, when we already know 
    he will. While there is some nice colorful Miami scenery (but nothing 
    approaching what we saw in the late, lamented series <B><A HREF="csi_miami_tv.htm">CSI:
     MIAMI</A></B> [2002 - 2012]), the plots are nothing we haven't seen 
    before and done much better. I have always liked Morris Chestnut as 
    an actor, but God only knows why he would pick a dog like this to 
    star in. It may get some viewers because it precedes FOX's unexpected 
    hit <B><A HREF="empire_tv_series_2015.htm">EMPIRE</A></B> (Wednesdays 
    9:00pm), but people will quickly tune out because it really is 
    nothing worth watching. This should have never made it past the pilot 
    stage. (<B>NOTE:</B> The season opener earned a respectable 7.4 
    million viewers, but consider that <B>EMPIRE</B>, which followed it, 
    received 16 million viewers and draw your own conclusions. The only 
    show it beat in its time period was NBC's <B><A HREF="mysteries_of_laura_tv_series_2014.htm">THE
     MYSTERIES OF LAURA</A></B>. The biggest mystery is why that show was 
    renewed for a second season to begin with (NBC ordered an additional 
    5 scripts!) . There are already talks within FOX to cancel it. FOX 
    ordered three more scripts for the series, but that is still well 
    short of a full season, so apparently they want the show to continue 
    a little longer because <B>EMPIRE</B> is beginning to bleed viewers, 
    losing nearly 4 million viewers from the Second Season premiere. <B>NOTE
     #2:</B> FOX has given the series a full season order. They seem to 
    be the only network willing to give shows a chance to find an 
    audience. <B>NOTE #3:</B> FOX has renewed it for a Second Season, 
    moving it to Thursday Night, proving that ratings don't mean that

    (Thursdays 10:00pm). While it is great to see Wesley Snipes get a 
    weekly paying gig after spending a few years in the pen for his <A HREF="player_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/player 2015 series premiere tv ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>IRS
     troubles, it's a shame that it would have to be in this overly 
    complicated action/adventure series, which I am sure will not last 
    long. Snipes plays &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot; (no first name given), a 
    Pit Boss at a casino who works in conjunction with a Dealer named 
    Cassandra (Charity Wakefield) and a new Player, Alex Kane (Philip 
    Winchester; late of Cinemax's <B><A HREF="strike_back_tv_series_2011.htm">STRIKE
     BACK</A></B> [2011 - 2015]) to solve crimes determined by a still 
    yet-unknown mathematical algorithm created for billionaire gamblers, 
    who bet on the outcome of every crime, Since the old Player was 
    killed in the last outing, Mr. Johnson must teach Alex Kane (a former 
    Special Ops agent) the rules of the &quot;game&quot;. Snipes gets to 
    show off his real life martial arts prowess (But not enough in the 
    first three episodes I watched. He comes iff more like a dandy.), 
    Cassandra uses her brain and technology and Alex his military 
    training (and plenty of weaponry) to stop the crimes and there are 
    some decent action sequences and stunts. Mr. Johnson is loyal to the 
    &quot;House&quot;, so he sometimes works against the best interests 
    of Alex and Cassandra (and he may be responsible for the last 
    Player's death). There's also the fact that this organization could 
    have made it look as if Alex's wife was killed by a burglar, so Alex 
    joins the &quot;club&quot; to discover the truth, because he believes 
    that his wife is still alive. While there is plenty of gunplay, car 
    chases, stunts and explosions to satisfy action junkies, the story 
    lines are convoluted and overly mind-boggling (the pilot episode will 
    have you saying, &quot;What the hell?&quot; at least a dozen times). 
    There's only so much nonsense a person can take, so look for this one 
    to tank quickly (it plays opposite CBS' Thursday Night Football for 
    the first couple of months and then <B><A HREF="elementary_tv_series_2012.htm">ELEMENTARY</A></B>,

    It opened with a respectable 7 million viewers over the first three 
    days (which is normal for ratings now, since they take DVR viewing 
    into consideration) and Sony Television has sold the series to 105 
    territories, which means it will be around for a while (though not 
    necessarily on U.S. TV). <B>NOTE #2:</B> NBC ordered the show to be 
    stopped after 9 episodes and then production will be shut down. Does 
    not look good for the series, even in the 105 territories it was sold 
    to. Sounds like a cancellation to me, but as of October 24, 2015, NBC 
    has yet to announce it, probably because they don't want to be the 
    first of the four major networks (I'm not counting The CW as a major 
    network) to announce the &quot;C&quot; word. Sounds to me that they 
    are waiting for FOX to cancel <B><A HREF="minority_report_tv_series_2015.htm">MINORITY

    ABC's <B><A HREF="quantico_tv_series_2015.htm">QUANTICO</A></B> 
    (Sundays 10:00pm). It was only a matter of time before someone 
    created a series about FBI trainees at the facility located in 
    Quantico, Virginia and get nearly everything wrong (I should know. I 
    trained there.). Couple that with the worst time period of the week 
    (NBC shows football until the end of January and it runs smack up 
    against this series. Add to that the usual CBS football overruns and 
    people that are addicted to <B><A HREF="good_wife_tv_series_2009-2016.htm">THE
     GOOD WIFE</A></B> [myself included] and very few people will be 
    watching this new series except for the ones who do not care for that 
    sport or the other mentioned TV series) and this will probably be 
    low-rated, but I expect ABC to<A HREF="quantico_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/quantico series premiere tv ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    stick with it because no matter what series is shown at that time 
    slot usually gets low ratings. The series begins with an explosion, 
    as New York's City's Grand Central Terminal is destroyed and FBI 
    trainee Alex Parrish (Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra) is found among 
    the rubble and arrested as a terrorist. The series then flashes back 
    to when Alex and her class are being trained to be FBI Agents at the 
    titled facility (Why so all the trainees look like models, both males 
    and females with perfect bodies? It's just not realistic, but I guess 
    it makes for &quot;good&quot; television.). We get to know all her 
    other fellow trainees and that they all hold their own secrets and 
    skeletons (Don't we all?) and that maybe Alex was set up by one of 
    them to take the fall. Besides getting the training all wrong (Where 
    are the classes that show the right way and the wrong way to chase a 
    perp, either on foot or by car? Where are the classes on identifying 
    EDPs [emotionally disturbed persons] and suicidal people? FBI 
    training is a lot more than they show on this series, especially the 
    first three episodes that I received as screeners), so setting the 
    series as a set of flashbacks grows tiresome after a while. Yes, 
    there are some great fight scenes, action set pieces and Ms. Chopra 
    is very good in her role, but I can't get past how many things they 
    get wrong in this series (I would love to meet the FBI consultant and 
    kick him in the nuts) and the soap opera moments (and there are 
    many). Maybe people that don't know the truth about how Agents are 
    trained (there is as much paperwork as there is physical training) 
    will like this better than I do, but I just can't get past the truth. 
    This series follows ABC's new nighttime soap opera about the North 
    Dakota oil boom (but filmed in Utah), <B><A HREF="blood_and_oil_tv_series_2015.htm">BLOOD
     &amp; OIL</A></B> (Sundays 9:00pm), and even though it is great to 
    see Don Johnson on TV again, I am not the right type of person to 
    review it, but ABC cut the number of episodes from 13 to 10, so it 
    does not look good for Don Johnson, even though I did watch the pilot 
    episode and liked watching Johnson back on our TV screens again on a 
    major network. The man still has a commanding presence (and, even 
    though I am not gay, the man just keeps on getting more handsome as 
    he gets older). He just needs the right type of show to highlight it.<B> NOTE:</B> <B>QUANTICO</B> 
    averages 11.1 million viewers and ABC gave it a full season order. <B>NOTE
     #2:</B> A new lawsuit claims the idea for ABC&#146;s hit freshman 
    FBI drama was lifted from a 1999 documentary that aired on CNN. These 
    lawsuits usually get settled before they go to court. <B>NOTE #3:</B> 
    ABC has renewed the series for a second season and moved filming from 
    Montreal to New York City. <B>*</B> CBS' <B><A HREF="supergirl_tv_series_2015.htm">SUPERGIRL</A></B> 
    (Mondays 8:00pm). Of all the networks to avoid the Marvel and DC 
    Comics Universe, CBS was the only holdout (Their last full-season 
    superhero show was the one season <B><A HREF="flash_tv_series_1990.htm">THE
     FLASH</A></B> in 1990). That is until this season. Based on the 
    pilot (which will be shown on October 26, 2015 at 8:30pm and is the 
    only screener of the series I received), it looks like they are 
    trying a little too hard to make a family-friendly superhero show (It 
    is interesting how it is going up against the much more dark and 
    violent <B><A HREF="gotham_tv_series_2014.htm">GOTHAM</A></B> on FOX, 
    since they both come from the DC Comics Universe). Melissa Benoist 
    (late of <B><A HREF="glee_tv_series_2009.htm">GLEE</A></B> [2009 - 
    2015]) portrays 24 year-old Kara Zor-El, the cousin of <A HREF="supergirl_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/supergirl 2015 tv ad10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Superman,
     who takes the Earth name &quot;Kara Danvers&quot; in National City 
    and was raised by the Danvers (Dean Cain portrays the father and 
    Helen Slater portray s the mother figure in a photo only, which is 
    only in the pilot. I'll let you figure out why and make the 
    connections to a certain other late superhero series and movies.) and 
    her step-sister Alex Danvers (Chyler Leigh; who turns out not to be 
    what she seems) to keep her superpowers secret (she hasn't used a 
    single one in 12 years), but a catastrophe happens, where Kara Zor-El 
    must expose her powers to the world, while she keeps her Kara 
    character separate from her alter ego (the same way Clark 
    Kent/Superman does). Kara works for hard-ass newspaper executive Cat 
    Grant (Calista Flockhart; who wants to lay off 40% of the paper's 
    workers), where she meets newly-arrived art director Jimmy Olsen 
    (here portrayed by black actor Mehcad Brooks and referred to as 
    &quot;James Olsen&quot; [&quot;Only my parents and the Big Guy call 
    me Jimmy.&quot;], but make no mistake, this is Superman's pal). I'll 
    let you discover the pretty pat plot of the pilot (it is more 
    interested in introducing the characters, one who is a worker who she 
    exposes her real identity to, although there is a villain here [and 
    other ones shown at the end of the episode and one of them the Aunt 
    of Kara] a secret government organization called the &quot;DEO&quot; 
    which Alex is a high-ranking member), but the one complaint I have 
    about the show is that it tones down the violence a little too much 
    and Supergirl's costume couldn't be less revealing if they tried. 
    While some of the flying scenes are impressive (a mixture of physical 
    effects goosed with CGI, including a plane rescue that Supergirl 
    makes land on water ala Captain Sully Sullenberger and exposes her to 
    the world, which saves the jobs of those 40% because the newspaper is 
    now as popular as The Daily Planet.), there just wasn't enough here 
    for the adult in me. I'm sure teenage girls will eat this up, but 
    when adult males take a look at her costume, expect them to tune out 
    rather quickly. If that seems misogynistic, it really isn't, because 
    that's the way the comics universe works (the sexier, the better). 
    Even Lynda Carter as <B><A HREF="wonder_woman_tv_series.htm">WONDER WOMAN</A></B> 
    back in the 1970's had a more revealing costume. I'll give this a 
    couple of more episodes to improve, but I was never a big fan of 
    superhero films and TV series to begin with. So far, it is more style 
    over substance and Calista Flockhart is more misogynistic then most 
    men I know. <B>NOTE #1:</B> The pilot episode opened with 12.9 
    million viewers (that's not counting the Plus 3 or Plus 7 ratings), 
    which virtually guarantees that it will be picked up for a full 
    season. Or maybe the lead-in, CBS's most-watched sitcom, <B><A HREF="big_bang_theory_tv_series_2007.htm">THE
     BIG BANG THEORY</A></B>, led to its huge ratings. We will find out 
    next week when the sitcom moves to Thursdays and the new show takes 
    over the 8:00pm timeslot. I predict it will lose at least 4 million 
    viewers in its second week, which is still good ratings for network 
    TV in this dismal year, one of the worst in all the major networks' 
    history. If the series takes off (so to speak) expect to see 
    crossovers with CW's <B><A HREF="flash_tv_series_2014.htm">THE FLASH</A></B>&nbsp;
     (on <A HREF="supergirl_the_flash_crossover_episode_2016.htm">March 
    28, 2016</A>) and <B><A HREF="arrow_tv_series_2012.htm">ARROW</A></B>,
     since they exist in the same &quot;multi-universes&quot; and all 
    three shows are owned by CBS. <B>NOTE #</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">2</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>:</B> 
    The CBS comic book adaptation sunk 23 percent in its third week in 
    the key 18-49 demographic. Last week, the drop was 31 percent from 
    series premiere to Episode 2. Looks like <B>THE BIG BANG THEORY</B> 
    lead-in was the reason for the huge opening numbers. <B>NOTE #3:</B> 
    CBS picked the series up for a full season, even with the low 
    ratings, but their idea of a full season is 20 episodes, not the 
    usual 22 to 24 episodes. And they are bringing in Superman for one of 
    those episodes to try and increase ratings after they promised at 
    ComicCon that the Man Of Steel would stay away from this series (he 
    only appeared in shadows, so you could not see his face).&nbsp; Now 
    if NBC would learn to do the same thing. Plenty of people are pissed 
    that NBC cancelled <B>THE PLAYER</B> after only 9 episodes. Lots (and 
    I mean lots) of backlash for NBC's move. <B>NOTE #4:</B> CBS is 
    either thinking about cancelling the show or moving it to The CW. <B>NOTE
     #5:</B> May 13, 2016: It is official, <B>SUPERGIRL</B> will be 
    moving to The CW for its Second Season. It will air on Mondays at 8:00pm,</FONT></FONT></P>

    News: </B>Here's one for the books: On Superbowl Sunday, February 7, 
    2016, CBS announced, via commercial during the game, that this season 
    (the seventh) of <B><A HREF="good_wife_tv_series_2009-2016.htm">THE 
    GOOD WIFE</A></B> would be its last (and it only had 7 episodes to 
    go!). Talk about balls. It was a guilty pleasure of mine, but it was 
    getting long in the tooth. No word if all the plotlines would be 
    concluded properly, though.; SyFy cancelled <B><A HREF="defiance_tv_series_2013-2015.htm">DEFIANCE</A></B> 
    after three seasons and <B><A HREF="dominion_tv_series_2014.htm">DOMINION</A></B> 
    after two seasons. The angels have fallen. January 8. 2016: Sundance 
    has announced that their critically acclaimed, but low-rated, series <B><A HREF="rectify_tv_series_2013-2016.htm">RECTIFY</A></B> 
    will end after the Fourth Season (which is shooting in early 2016). 
    The CW has canceled <B><A HREF="americas_next_top_model_2003-2015.htm">AMERICA'S
     NEXT TOP MODEL</A></B> after &quot;22&quot; Seasons (actually 11

    up with. NOTE: Well, that was a short cancellation. VH1 picked up the 
    series without host Tyra Banks (but she will remain as a Producer). 
    Now, I would really hate to be her assistant! ABC cancelled the 
    Canadian Summer series <B><A HREF="rookie_blue_tv_series_2010-2015.htm">ROOKIE
     BLUE</A></B> after 6 seasons (Even after it won a Canadian Golden

    Amazon Prime announced that the fifth season of <B><A HREF="ripper_street_tv_series_2012-2016.htm">RIPPER
     STREET</A></B> (2012 - 2016) would be the last. It was cancelled by

    renewed the series for another two seasons with hopes of getting Cote 
    de Pablo to return sporadically as Ziva David (She isn't at the time 
    of this writing because she got her own pilot movie currently filming 
    for the SyFy Network and they killed her off in the season finale [or 
    did they?], with Tony finding out she had a daughter with him. He 
    left his team to become a father. It got blockbuster ratings.). They 
    have also changed the format of the series and Jennifer Esposito, 
    formerly of <B><A HREF="blue_bloods_tv_series_2010.htm">BLUE BLOODS</A></B>,
     has joined the cast. Let's see if it works. ABC has renewed <B><A HREF="once_upon_a_time_tv_series_2011.htm">ONCE
     UPON A TIME</A></B> for a Sixth Season and <B><A HREF="greys_anatomy_tv.htm">GREY'S

    cancellation? Neil Patrick Harris finally learns that he doesn't shit

    could it succeed? Maybe if they called it <B>GOOD TIMES WITH NEIL

    &quot;J.J.&quot; Walker could have been the announcer. CBS announced

     where Matt LeBlanc plays a bastardized version of himself (And won a

     HOSPITAL</A></B> (where he plays a clown doctor) after seven 
    seasons. Corddry stated that the seventh season is the best yet and 
    was satisfied that he has done his best work and the series takes all 
    his time, since he's the creator/writer/star. So he is ending it 
    before it gets stale and he can move on and do other things (Looks 
    like he was right, as he picked up his first Emmy for Actor in a 
    Short Form Comedy or Drama Series at the 68th Creative Arts Emmys&reg;
     on September 11. 2016.). Actors from the CW's <B><A HREF="vampire_diaries_tv_series_2009.htm">THE

    announced that they have picked up the weird Zach Galifianakis rodeo 
    clown comedy <B><A HREF="baskets_tv_series_2016.htm">BASKETS</A></B> 
    for a second season. TBS cancelled their half-hour sitcom <B><A HREF="clipped_tv_series_2015.htm">CLIPPED</A></B> 
    after one season. I'm thinking the same thing as you: There was a 
    scripted show called <B>CLIPPED</B>? In related news, IFC cancelled 
    their one season hockey comedy <B><A HREF="benders_tv_series_2015.htm">BENDERS</A></B> 
    after only 8 episodes. I never heard of it before since IFC and I 
    don't have a friendly relationship when they switched over to be a 
    advertizer-driven channel and still retained the name 
    &quot;Independent&quot;. That's the antithesis of being independent. 
    And they show more commercials than most stations. They show the 
    91-minute film <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    (1978) in a 150 minute timeslot. You do the math. ABC Family (soon to

    announced that the Seventh Season of <B><A HREF="pretty_little_liars_tv_series_2010.htm">PRETTY

    after two seasons. At least it ended where they tested the bomb and

     the first two seasons on Chiller (and half of the 3rd Season on SyFy 
    as part of their 2016 Thanksgiving marathon) and found myself liking 
    it for not taking itself too seriously (although there is a ton of 
    gore and people say &quot;shit&quot; a lot, which seems to be the new 
    swear word allowed on non-pay cable). And it is the first TV series 
    to come from The Asylum! I especially love the over-age hippy Doc 
    (Russell Hodgkinson). He has some of the best lines. And there are 
    some imaginative photographic and editing tricks (the zombie made to 
    look like a coin was pure genius!). Who would think that The Asylum 
    was capable of such things? Another show to put on my weekly DVR 
    list. It pulled me in and won't let go. Unlike that other zombie show 
    that gets millions of viewers each week (when they are not splitting 
    up a 13-episode season for &quot;Winter Hiatus&quot;) to watch 
    cliche-ridden people, this show has characters that care about each 
    other and continually put their lives on the line to save their 
    friends. Actor D.J. Qualls is also featured in this series. 2015 has 
    been a busy year for him (look for my review of <B><A HREF="man_in_the_high_castle_tv_series_2015.htm">THE

    his &quot;zoo&quot;, can't be all bad. Quite the opposite. Does that 
    other zombie show have zombie bears and zombie packs of wolves? I 
    don't think so. And this series was killing people and zombies with a 
    baseball bat long before the other, more popular one. <B>NOTE:</B> On

     MUPPETS</A></B> (cancelled on May 12, 2016), which was 
    &quot;retooled&quot; for the second half of the season. Netflix 
    renewed <B><A HREF="daredevil_netflix_series_2015.htm">DAREDEVIL</A></B> 
    for a third season. That is the best news in the Renewal Department. 
    Netflix has also decided to revive <B><A HREF="mystery_science_theater_3000.htm">MYSTERY
     SCIENCE THEATER 3000</A></B>, but without the participation of Mike 
    Nelson. Almost everyone else will return, as well as Patton Oswalt 
    also as a regular. Original series creator Joel Hodgson raised over 6 
    million dollars on Kickstarter for a 14 episode season run; no other 
    film or television project has ever raised more via a crowdfunding 
    campaign. No airdate or time of filming yet. Starz has greenlighted a 
    Second Season of their anthology series <B><A HREF="missing_tv_series_2014.htm">THE
     MISSING</A></B>. FOX renewed <B><A HREF="gotham_tv_series_2014.htm">GOTHAM</A></B> 
    for a third season and the low-rated <B><A HREF="sleepy_hollow_tv_series_2013.htm">SLEEPY
     HOLLOW</A></B> for a fourth season, even though co-star Nicole 
    Beharie died in the third season finale. THE USA Network renewed its 
    drug/action series <B><A HREF="queen_of_the_south_tv_series_2016.htm">QUEEN
     OF THE SOUTH</A></B> (based on the popular Mexican Telenovela 
    &quot;La Rieva Del Sur&quot;) for a Second Season, to air sometime in 
    the Summer of 2017. WGN renewed their popular series <B><A HREF="salem_tv_series_2014.htm">SALEM</A></B> 
    for a third season, which will premiere sometime in April or later in 
    2016. My cable company finally added this channel to their 
    line-up.They have since announced a Season 4 will happen in 
    2017.&nbsp; On the other end of spectrum, Fox has decreased the order 
    on its midseason show <B><A HREF="second_chance_tv_series_2016.htm">SECOND
     CHANCE</A></B> (previously known as <B>LOOKINGLASS</B> and <B>THE 
    FRANKENSTEIN CODE</B>) from 13 to 11 episodes because they just have 
    too many new mideseason shows on their schedule. Pretty soon the 
    title will be changed to <B>FLUFFY LITTLE BUNNY</B>. This does not 
    mean FOX has any<A HREF="z_nation_tv_series_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/z nation 2104 series premiere tv ad2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="216" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    reservations about the series. Many cable shows run 13 episodes or 
    less for a season and that includes FOX's own <B><A HREF="scream_queens_tv_series_2015.htm">SCREAM
     QUEENS</A></B>. (<B>NOTE:</B> It looks like there will be no more 
    second chances based in the ratings the show is getting following <B><A HREF="sleepy_hollow_tv_series_2013.htm">SLEEPY
     HOLLOW</A></B> on Friday nights. It was officially cancelled on May 
    12, 2016. As a matter of fact, only two new FOX series were given a 
    Season 2, that being <A HREF="rosewood_tv_series_2015.htm"><B>ROSEWOOD</B></A> 
    and <B>SCREAM QUEENS</B>.).&nbsp;FX has cancelled <B><A HREF="tyrant_tv_series_2014.htm">TYRANT</A></B> 
    after three seasons. It will be shopped around to other networks and 
    streaming services to see if there is interest to produce more 
    seasons. On April 1, 2016, Amazon Prime renewed <B><A HREF="bosch_amazon_series_2015.htm">BOSCH</A></B> 
    for a third season. A must-watch streaming series. Titus Welliver as 
    the titled homicide detective is amazing and multi-layered. Or you 
    could buy it eventually on disc. ABC has given a full season order to <B><A HREF="muppets_tv_series_2015.htm">THE
     MUPPETS</A></B> (and retooled the second half of the season to make 
    it more &quot;family friendly&quot;, but it still was cancelled). NBC 
    announced that there would be a &quot;backdoor pilot&quot; for a 
    spinoff series of <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE BLACKLIST</A></B>,
     which will air on the show on May 12, 2016. Ryan Eggold, who 
    portrays Tom Keen on the show (I really don't want him to leave. He 
    adds a layer to the show that is needed.), would star with Famke 
    Janssen (she will make an appearance on the May 5, 2016 episode, 
    portraying Tom Keen's mother, to set up the premise), who will 
    co-star in the series if it is green-lit. Tom Keen just almost 
    remarried the pregnant Liz, but a terrible thing happens which opens 
    the door for the spinoff. <B>UPDATE:</B> NBC Has green-lit the 
    backdoor pilot, to be called <B><A HREF="blacklist_redemption_tv_series_2017.htm">THE

    at 10:00pm.). NBC also renewed <B><A HREF="grimm_tv_series_2011.htm">GRIMM</A></B> 
    for a Sixth Season, but cut its episode order to 13. Looks like it 
    will be the last season. It's one horror series I was never able to 
    get into, but it has its diehard fans. <B>NOTE:</B> August 29, 2016: 
    NBC announced that the Sixth Season would, indeed, be its last. NBC 
    also cancelled <B><A HREF="mysteries_of_laura_tv_series_2014.htm">THE 
    MYSTERIES OF LAURA</A></B> after two seasons. The biggest mystery is

    has been officially cancelled after 8 Seasons. The USA Network has 
    cancelled <B><A HREF="satisfaction_tv_series_2014.htm">SATISFACTION</A></B> 
    after two seasons. A&amp;E announced that the fifth season of <B><A HREF="bates_motel_tv_series_2013.htm">BATES
     MOTEL</A></B> would be its last. The final season will be like an 
    extended version of Alfred Hitchcock's film <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> 
    (1960), with singer&nbsp;Rihanna joining the cast as Marion Crane. It 
    will be interesting to see how they film the iconic shower scene. HBO 
    has cancelled the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon film making docu-series <B><A HREF="project_geenlight_season_3_2005_season_4_2015.htm">PROJECT
     GREENLIGHT</A></B> for a Fifth Season. The making of the show was 
    better than the movies that came out of it. Season 3 of the show was 
    on cable channel Bravo in 2005 with the late Wes Craven as a guest 
    judge and John Gulager was the winner and he went on to direct <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Feast 2006">FEAST</A></B> 
    (2006) based on a screenplay by Marcus Dunstan &amp; Patrick Melton 
    (which had to be altered quite a bit to accomodate the low budget). 
    It is probably the most enjoyable film to come from the series (which 
    originally started out on HBO before moving to Bravo), but what hoops 
    Gulager had to jump through to get it made (He eventually made two 
    equally weird, but entertaining, sequels). Affleck and Damon agreed 
    to return for a Season Four ten years later in 2015 on HBO (where 
    saying &quot;fuck&quot; is more than acceptable) to document the 
    making of a comedy film, but all the in-fighting between the people 
    that we usually never see behind-the-scenes was just too much for 
    Damon (who had some on-air fights of his own), so HBO cancelled the 
    series (it was also one of their lowest-rated series). Drama is easy. 
    Comedy is hard. Maybe in ten more years we will have a Season Five. 
    Lifetime has cancelled <B><A HREF="devious_maids_tv_series_2013.htm">DEVIOUS
     MAIDS</A></B> after 4 Seasons.&nbsp;On August 16, 2016, The USA 
    Network gave <B><A HREF="mr_robot_tv_series_2015.htm">MR. ROBOT</A></B> 
    approval for a Season 3. They would be nuts not to. While Season 2 
    has not been getting the Press of Season 1 and gets low ratings 
    (Epidode 5 of Season 2 only received 600,000 viewers!), it is still 
    one of the best cable series on the air and the show is basically 
    ratings bulletproof since it put USA Network on the map as a channel 
    of quality drama (It has won Peabody, AFI, Writers Guild and Golden 
    Globe kudos to date, not counting multiple Emmy Award nominations for 
    the First Season). Showtime has renewed its new financial thriller 
    series <B><A HREF="billions_tv_series_2016.htm">BILLIONS</A></B> for 
    a Second Season. FX announced that Season 4 of <B><A HREF="strain_tv_series_2014.htm">THE
     STRAIN</A></B> would be its last.&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp;<B> Happy News Dept:</B> 
    I'm not a big fan of superhero shows, but I am glad that the CW's 
    November 4, 2015 episode of <B><A HREF="arrow_tv_series_2012.htm">ARROW</A></B>,
     titled &#147;Haunted,&#148; will feature Matt Ryan reprising his 
    role as <B><A HREF="constantine_tv_series_2014.htm">CONSTANTINE</A></B>,
     who hasn't been seen since the NBC series was cancelled in 2014, 
    which I thought deserved a renewal, but NBC fucked around with its 
    timeslot until it was impossible to find. Let's hope he makes more 
    appearances. It will give me an excuse to watch a show on CW, 
    something I haven't done in years (I gave up on <B><A HREF="supernatural_tv_series_2005.htm">SUPERNATURAL</A></B> 
    when it became more of a soap opera, where being dead is not the end 
    and they quit battling monsters of the week and it became a 
    supernatural conspiracy series. I know it still has its fans, but I'm 
    not one of them. After the first three seasons, I quit watching.). FX 
    has renewed <B><A HREF="americans_tv_series_2013.htm">THE AMERICANS</A></B> 
    for Season 5 and Season 6, with the latter serving as the acclaimed 
    series&#146; swan song, the cabler announced on Wednesday, May 25, 
    2016. The 13-episode fifth season will air in 2017, followed by a 
    10-episode sixth and final season in 2018. FOX has become the first 
    broadcast network to announce that it will no longer provide 
    &#147;live plus same-day&#148; ratings. Makes perfect sense to me 
    since I watch most shows on my DVR. All other networks should drop 
    this practice, too, and use the Plus-3 &amp; Plus-7 system. It is 
    more realistic in today's Internet Age. HBO announced that after ten 
    years, <B><A HREF="deadwood.htm">DEADWOOD</A></B> would have a 
    two-hour movie to tie-up all the loose ends to air either in 2016 or 
    2017. Time to bring out those DVD sets and rewatch the original 3 
    seasons. Cocksucker. <B>NOTE:</B> April 19, 2017: A <B>DEADWOOD</B> 
    movie finale script written by series creator David Milch has been 
    delivered to HBO. They have not yet said whether they will film this 
    version or wait for another script. A script by David Milch? Ian 
    McShane says he and the rest of the old cast are dying to do it. Just 
    film the motherfucking thing, cocksucker! Speaking of HBO, <B><A HREF="game_of_thrones_tv_series_2011.htm">GAME
     OF THRONES</A></B>&nbsp; (Jon Snow is not dead!) showrunners David 
    Benioff and D.B. Weiss are apparently considering shortened episode 
    runs for the show&#146;s final seasons. The Sixth Season, which 
    debuts April 24, 2016, will contain the usual 10 episodes. But the 
    Seventh and final Eighth Season will share 13 episodes. HBO may 
    change their minds, but that is the word as of right now. <B>NOTE:</B> 
    HBO announced that Season 8 would be the last. Showtime on Monday 
    April 25, 2016 released the official cast list for its upcoming <B>TWIN
     PEAKS</B> revival to be shown in 2017 and it contains a staggering 
    217 names! Almost all of them are recognizable. My favorite is Trent 
    Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, one of my favorite industrial bands who 
    turned into an excellent music scorer of films. &nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B>Bitching &amp; Moaning Dept:</B> Why would CBS show the Season 4 
    premiere of <B><A HREF="elementary_tv_series_2012.htm">ELEMENTARY</A></B> 
    (Thursdays 10:00pm) and then not show the next episode for two weeks 
    because a football game is on the next week? When John Noble shows up 
    as Sherlock Holmes' father at the end of the first episode, you don't 
    want to wait two weeks to see what happens. C'mon CBS, use your head. 
    You could have waited until Thursday Night Football ended before 
    showing the first episode. We fans of the show would have gladly 
    waited. <B>NOTE:</B> It looks like only the East Coast missed the 
    second episode (The football game was the Jets) because on November 
    19, 2015, they showed episode #3, so we on the East Coast have no 
    idea what went on in Episode #2 (Looks like it's On Demand time!). 
    Fuck you, CBS! It looks like they are going to do it again so we on 
    the East Coast miss Episode #5, too, on December 3, 2015 (But they 
    did re-air it the next week on Thursday). Double fuck you to CBS. I 
    am boycotting their shows and will now only buy the ones I want on 
    DVD or Blu-Ray. As far as I'm concerned, CBS doesn't care about their 
    audience in the East Coast, Not everyone has football fever (Who the 
    hell on the East Coast gives two shits about a Packers/Lions game?). 
    And now the series is going on &quot;Winter Hiatus&quot; after 6 
    episodes, two episodes viewers on the East Coast haven't even seen. 
    Are they fucked in the head? You've already ruined Sundays (An 
    episode of <B>CSI: CYBER</B> was pulled from the schedule when 
    football overruns went over one hour on Sunday November 29, 2015. <B>NOTE:</B> 
    On May 12, 2016, CBS cancelled <B>CSI: CYBER</B>, ending the <B>CSI:</B> 
    dynasty.). This is the same exact thing they did to <B>CSI: CRIME 
    SCENE INVESTIGATION</B> the year before and we all know what happened 
    to that series. <B>NOTE #1</B>: On March 20, 2016, CBS is moving <B>ELEMENTARY</B> 
    to Sundays at 10:00pm to make room for their new series <B><A HREF="rush_hour_tv_series_2016.htm">RUSH
     HOUR</A></B> (which has been getting anemic ratings and will not be 
    renewed) and <B><A HREF="csi_cyber_tv_series_2015.htm">CSI: CYBER</A></B> 
    (which is beginning to look like this is its final season, or is it?) 
    will be moving to Wednesdays at 10:00pm to burn off a couple of 
    episodes&nbsp; on March 2 &amp; 9, 2016 to bridge the Season One 
    finale of <B><A HREF="code_black_tv_series_2015.htm">CODE BLACK</A></B> 
    and the new series <B><A HREF="criminal_minds_beyond_borders_2016.htm">CRIMINAL
     MINDS: BEYOND BORDERS</A></B> (This in the second <B><A HREF="criminal_minds_tv_series.htm">CRIMINAL

     MINDS: SUSPECT BEHAVIOR</A></B> [2011] lasted one season. This new 
    one was renewed for a second season.). Speaking of <B>CRIMINAL MINDS</B>:
     On March 23, 2016, Shemar Moore announced he will be leaving the 
    series after this season (his final episode was on March 23, 2016, 
    where he found out his girlfriend was pregnant and married her). I 
    guess Penelope will have to find someone else to call her &quot;baby 
    girl&quot;. In a better note, Paget Brewster is returning to the 
    veteran CBS crime drama for multiple episodes during the upcoming 
    12th season. She will reprise her role as SSA Emily Prentiss. It 
    looks like we will soon be saying goodbye to <B>ELEMENTARY</B> since 
    CBS has put the series into their &quot;death time slot&quot;, 
    Sundays at 10:00pm (so far, it has only been shown on time once and 
    the season is almost over). The first episode in that time slot was 
    34 minutes late due to &quot;March Madness&quot; basketball. Another 
    reason to hate CBS (I'm giving them the double middle finger right 
    now). <B>UPDATE:</B> Looks like I was wrong. On March 25, 2015, CBS 
    announced the following established series will return for the 
    2016-2017 TV Season: They are <B><A HREF="blue_bloods_tv_series_2010.htm">BLUE
     BLOODS</A></B>, <B>ELEMENTARY</B>, <B><A HREF="hawaii_five_0_new_tv_series.htm">HAWAII

     <B><A HREF="survivor_tv_series_2000.htm">SURVIVOR</A></B>, a couple 
    more sitcoms and their usual roster of reality shows. The only 
    established shows that weren't mentioned for renewal were <B>CRIMINAL MINDS</B> 
    and <B>CSI: CYBER</B> (we already know that this is the final season 
    for <B><A HREF="person_of_interest_tv_series_2011.htm">PERSON OF INTEREST</A></B>

    and Tuesday every week!] and <B><A HREF="good_wife_tv_series_2009-2016.htm">THE
     GOOD WIFE</A></B>), but I can't see them cancelling <B>CRIMINAL MINDS</B>,
     even without Shemar Moore (it's an expensive show to produce and CBS 
    doesn't own it [ABC Studios does], so it make very little money for 
    them), because the show is always in the Top 10 and you don't cancel 
    a Top 10 series. This announcement is no indication that they are 
    cancelled, though (Although I can see <B>CYBER</B> being deep-sixed, 
    but it may be saved because CBS does own this one. <B>NOTE:</B> <B>CSI:
     CYBER</B> was cancelled.). May is usually the month when the 
    networks make their final decisions. (<B>NOTE #2:</B> On June 8th, 
    2016, CBS announced that <B>CRIMINAL MINDS</B> would be renewed and <B><A HREF="csi_miami_tv.htm">CSI:
     MIAMI</A></B>'s Adam Rodriguez will be a new cast member, replacing 
    Shemar Moore's departure, Aisha Tyler has been upped to a series 
    regular and Paget Brewster is due back for multiple episodes as Emily 
    Prentiss (she has since been named a series regular for a second 
    time). <B>NOTE #3:</B> August 11, 2016: Thomas Gibson has reportedly 
    been suspended from the long-running CBS procedural for one, possibly 
    two episodes for &quot;assaulting&quot; writer-producer Virgil 
    Williams during production of an episode that Gibson was directing. 
    Gibson got into argument with Williams over &quot;creative 
    differences&quot; and kicked him in the shin (Once shooting begins, 
    the director is the boss.). Gibson&#146;s future status on the series 
    is also under review by CBS &amp; ABC Studio's Human Resources. What 
    is this, football? Penalties for a kick in the leg? Ridiculous if you 
    ask me. Just shake hands, make friends and move on. Working 18-hour 
    days are bound to bring out some temperments. It is not like Gibson 
    crippled the Producer. If he is let go from this series because of 
    this stupid incident, they will lose me as a viewer. It sounds to me 
    like the producers are making Gibson's life miserable because he is 
    one of two original male cast members left, therefore they have to 
    pay him the most money. There is no <B>CRIMINAL MINDS</B> without 
    Thomas Gibson, at least for me. <B>NOTE #</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">4</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>:</B> 
    August 12, 2016: Thomas Gibson has been &quot;Dismissed&quot; from 
    the series permanently. If that is the case, so have I as a viewer. 
    What a crock of bullshit. Anyone with a brain knows this is all about 
    money, even though CBS and ABC Studios are listing the times he was 
    bad on and off set to unfairly discredit him. So what? Is anyone 
    pure? Can you think straight with minimal sleep? It is not like 
    Gibson acted like Charlie Sheen on <B>TWO AND A HALF MEN</B>, which 
    was also on CBS and they let him get away with taking drugs, not 
    showing up for rehearsal, barely being able to stand and not knowing 
    his lines (and also acting like a psychopath who finally revealed he 
    is HIV-Positive from drug use, never bothering to tell the women he 
    slept with [&quot;Hey, I wore a rubber!&quot;]). They let him get 
    away with that for years. Now that is a reason for dismissal, but CBS 
    let Sheen get away with it for years before firing him. I wish you 
    nothing but good fortune, Thomas Gibson. And fuck you CBS and ABC 
    Studios for showing poor sportsmanship. Acting like assholes for a 
    kick in the shin. August 14. 2016: Thomas Gibson is pursuing legal 
    action after termination and defaming him in public. I hope he takes 
    the shirts off these bastards' backs. There is more really bad news 
    that John Noble will not return in Season 5 of <B>ELEMENTARY</B> as 
    Sherlock's father. CBS has also announced that <B><A HREF="zoo_tv_series_2015.htm">ZOO</A></B> 
    was renewed for a Third Season to air Summer 2017. Are they fucking 
    kidding me? HBO has announced that there may not be a Season 3 of <B><A HREF="true_detective_tv_series_2014.htm">TRUE

    a staff of writers instead of writing all the episodes by himself. Am 
    I the only one who liked Season 2? (<B>NOTE:</B> As of May 26, 2016, 
    it looks like there will be no Season 3, although HBO has said the 
    opposite and explained that they haven't come up with a story that 
    will stand up to the series' standards. They deny that the series is 
    dead. <B>NOTE #2:</B> July 26, 2017: Turns out there will be a Season

     OF HELL</A></B> (the first episode directed by Eli Roth) as a 
    &quot;binge event&quot; on Black Friday (November 27, 2015) and then 
    not showing the eighth and final episode. After watching seven 
    episodes, we are left with one episode that doesn't tie up the loose 
    ends? What a cheat on the audiences. <B>NOTE #1:</B> According to 
    sources, the first season was only seven episodes long (Who makes a 
    seven-episode first season?), but after watching all seven hours, I 
    was left with more questions than answers. For those of you that 
    missed the series on WE, it is now available for streaming on 
    platforms like Amazon. The bad news: You have to pay to watch it (at 
    least you won't have to put up with the many commercials and much of 
    the foul language silenced and violence trimmed). My hope is that 
    there is a second season to close some of the gaping plot holes.<B> 
    NOTE #2:</B> My source was wrong. There were 8 episodes produced for 
    the first season, so now I am pissed all over again. The 8th episode 
    isn't even available for streaming.&nbsp; <B>*&nbsp; Jesus Christ, 
    Not Again Dept:</B> NBC has once again moved the second season of <B><A HREF="aquarius_tv_series_2015.htm">AQUARIUS</A></B> 
    from its Thursday 9:00pm slot and moved it to Saturday nights at 
    9:00pm starting August 28, 2016 (until then, it is off the air, with 
    only 3 episodes left to go), partly because of low ratings and partly 
    because of the Rio Olympics and football pre-season games. NBC (who 
    will now be sharing Thursday Night Football with CBS an an 
    alternating basis) also said that that there will no longer be a 
    Season 3. They will probably replace it next Summer with some cheaply 
    produced reality series. NBC wouldn't know class if it bit them in 
    the ass. This is why Networks are going to fall down a huge ratings 
    sinkhole, while cable and streaming continue reign supreme and 
    prosper during the Summer. Name me one good scripted Summer series on 
    the Networks (beside <B>AQUARIUS</B>).</FONT></FONT></P>

    I couldn't think of a better way to ring out Halloween Night than 
    Starz's <B><A HREF="ash_vs_evil_dead_tv_series_2015.htm">ASH VS. EVIL DEAD</A></B> 
    (Saturdays 9:00pm). No, it's not perfect, but it is a fun way to wind 
    down Saturday Night TV watching before going out for the night. My 
    only real complaint is that each episode only runs 30 minutes (the 
    pilot episode was just slightly longer), but there was enough crazy<A HREF="ash_vs_evil_dead_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ash vs. the evil dead 2015 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    comedy, blood, guts, physical and digital effects and some great 
    demon makeup for 10 episodes of any other horror series (if you think 
    about it, 10 thirty-minutes episodes equals the running time of all 
    three original films, so it's like getting three more films.). And 
    since this is Starz, there is no holding back on the grue. Bruce 
    Campbell is extremely funny as Ash, an over-the-hill stockboy at big 
    Costco-like store, who we originally see strapping on a girdle and 
    hitting a bar just before it is about to close so he can get whatever 
    women are still in there by buying them a drink (Surprisingly, it 
    works). He finds one and screws her in the bathroom (but becomes 
    winded and asks for a time-out!) and then they go back to his trailer 
    (that's right he lives in a dinky trailer), where the drunk woman 
    notices the Necromicon, the Book Of The Dead and a drunk Ash reads a 
    passage from it for her. When he wakes up in the morning, the first 
    thing he says is &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; as he has once again unleashed 
    evil upon this world. He sees demons wherever he goes (including his 
    old landlady) and when he goes to his job (where he is chewed out by 
    his boss and then drops a box full of light bulbs), when co-workers 
    Pablo Simon Bolivar (Ray Santiago; he shoots a female co-worker in 
    the head that must be seen to be believed) and Kelly Maxwell (Dana 
    DeLorenzo) notice that strange things are beginning to happen. They 
    don't believe Ash's story until he brings them back to his trailer, 
    where all Hell breaks loose (you will see such sights as Ash blowing 
    a man's head clear off with a shotgun (he has a special button on his 
    floor he steps on where the sawed-off shotgun pops-up from the floor) 
    and Amanda throws him his chainsaw (he walks around with a wooden 
    hand, but removes it for this scene, which is this episodes's 
    show-stopper). Look for Lucy Lawless (She's still a knockout and will 
    be appearing in all 10 of the first season's episodes, but she's not 
    the good girl she pretends to be. By the end of the 9th episode, we 
    learn the shocking truth about her.). There's also a subplot about a 
    female police officer named Amanda Fisher (Jill Marie Jones) who is 
    forced to kill her partner when he turns into a demon, so she goes in 
    search of the mystery. I'm sure she and Ash will cross paths very 
    soon. The first episode was directed by Sam Raimi, so you can expect 
    all his patented camera tricks and there's a scene where a tiny doll 
    attacks Ash in the stockroom that is just so damn funny, you may pee 
    yourself (it is also very well done). My hope is that future 
    directors can keep up with Raimi's originality and keep the series 
    both laugh-out-loud funny and gory as hell. Only time will tell, but 
    Starz has so much faith in this show, they have already given it a 
    second season pickup (After watching all 10 episodes, rightfully 
    so.). Expect to see lots of jokes about Ash's age and weight and 
    Bruce Campbell taking as much punishment as possible (he gets more 
    than his share in the first episode alone, especially when he keeps 
    smashing flower pots on his face to get the doll off). I had a lot of 
    fun with the first episode and you should, too. It keeps the spirit 
    of the first three movies alive (not counting the remake), so those 
    of you sitting on the fence about watching this show should just give 
    in and view it. Totally <A HREF="wicked_city_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wicked city 2015 series premiere tv ad11 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>recommended.
     Probably the bloodiest thing ever on TV and that's saying a lot! And 
    to make things even better, when I came home from the night out, it 
    was actually an hour earlier thanks to the Fall time change! (<B>NOTE:</B> 
    The death of a major character in episode 8 came as a shocker [the 
    final three episodes of the season take place at the cabin in the 
    woods, where the original movie started and there are many remnants 
    and sights that fans of the first two films will notice], but the 
    whole season is full of crazy stuff like that [Such as Ash fighting 
    his evil self as they rattle-off all their past old-age injuries and 
    taking advantage of them on each other or Ash's old girlfriend's 
    head, which he chainsawed in a vise in the shed in the second movie, 
    starts talking sexy trash to him. And, yes, we do get to visit the 
    cabin's chained-up trapdoor basement again.]. Bring on Season 2!<B> 
    NOTE #2:</B> Season 2 has announced Lee Majors [as Ash's father] and 
    Ted Raimi [who appeared in all three films] as regulars. Lee Majors?

    on CGI this season and more practical [and super gory] special 
    effects [The episode with Ash's possessed car is a standout of gore

     CITY</A></B> (Tuesdays 10:00pm) is an interesting serialized serial 
    killer tale which I am almost 100% positive will get canceled soon. 
    Set in 1982 and full of songs from the time period (Including a Billy 
    Idol concert in the Sunset Strip! The actor who played Idol may have 
    been an impersonator, but the music was the real deal and the music 
    rights to the show must cost a small fortune alone since all of them 
    are the original recordings, not new recordings by sound-alikes). The 
    story is about serial killer Kent Galloway (Ed Westwick in an 
    Emmy&reg; worthy performance) who picks up women from bars, brings 
    them back to their apartment or houses and slaughters them. He's a 
    real psycho. On his case is Detective Jack Roth (Jeremy Sisto, who I 
    call the &quot;Network Serial Killer&quot; [<B><A HREF="law_order_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER</A></B> ended after he joined it] because whatever 
    network show he is a part of gets canceled. He has had more luck with 
    non-network shows, like HBO's <B><A HREF="six_feet_under_tv_series_2001-2005.htm">SIX
     FEET UNDER</A></B> and A&amp;E's <B><A HREF="returned_tv_series_2015.htm">THE
     RETURNED</A></B>), who has a more complicated family life than the 
    serial killer case he is working on. He is not only married with 
    kids, but he also has a mistress that is an undercover cocaine 
    dealer. But let's get back to Kent: He picks up a woman called Betty 
    Beaumontaine (Erika Christensen) at a bar and they go back to her 
    place, where he is surprised to find out that she likes the abuse 
    dished out to her (Especially the knife he pulls out. It looks like 
    she reaches orgasm when she sees it!). He admires her so much, he 
    doesn't kill her but rather, makes her his partner. Nothing like a 
    little change of modus operendi to confuse the police. Kent and Betty 
    go to bars and bring a woman back to her place, where they both can 
    play with her before they kill her. It will be interesting to see how 
    this series ends, but I have the feeling we are either going to have 
    to see it on disc or VOD because if the ratings don't improve, it 
    won't justify the cost of the 80's songs on the soundtrack. It runs 
    up against <B><A HREF="limitless_tv_series_2015.htm">LIMITLESS</A></B>,
     which, for some reason, has become a hit for CBS (even though that 
    show was getting decent ratings and I turned around and started 
    liking it, CBS went ahead and cancelled it), so don't expect to see 
    this series around much longer. This is a dark series, the exact 
    opposite of CBS' new show. <B>NOTE #1:</B> Just like I predicted, <B>WICKED
     CITY</B> was pulled off the air after only three aired episodes, 
    making it the first &quot;official&quot; cancellation of the 2015 - 
    2016 Season. Since 8 episodes have been filmed and shooting stopped, 
    no word on what will happen to the remaining 5 episodes (probably 
    streamed) since the series will never be conclusively ended. The 
    Jeremy Sisto Curse strikes again! The problem for me is that I liked 
    the series and would have loved to see this season's story concluded 
    (Since each 10-episode season was supposed to tell a different 
    story). <B>NOTE #2:</B> Good News: Since the cast and crew heard of 
    the cancellation in the middle of filming Episode 8, they were able 
    to rework the teleplay and give the story closure. They also said 
    that the entire series will be streamed sometime next year. More 
    information as it comes in. <B>NOTE #3:</B> The remaining episodes 
    (as well as the episodes also aired) will be shown on streaming 
    service Hulu. The premiere of Episode 8 has not been determined yet. 
    Once again, it takes a streaming service to give viewers closure on 
    low-rated TV Series.&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; AMC's <B><A HREF="into_the_badlands_tv_series_2015.htm">INTO
     THE BADLANDS</A></B> (Sundays 10:00pm) is a return of martial arts 
    to TV, but, unfortunately, although the martial arts and 
    bone-crunching violence are as bloody as you are likely to see on 
    regular cable TV, the rest<A HREF="into_the_badlands_tv_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/into the badlands 2015 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    of the story is somewhat lacking. This short, 6-episode season 
    (riding the coattails on the last two episodes of <B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE
     WALKING DEAD</A></B> before they go on &quot;Winter Hiatus&quot;) is 
    a post-apocalyptic story where guns are no longer in use, so everyone 
    uses bladed weapons. In the opening, we see Sunny (Daniel Wu) driving 
    his pristine motorcycle along some very beautiful flowered highway 
    that is littered with dead bodies, but it doesn't faze him at all. 
    Even less that fazes him are the bandits up ahead that block his 
    entrance into Louisiana, which is run by seven different powerful 
    rulers. The fight that develops between Sunny and the bandits is 
    certainly one for the books when it comes to breaking the violence 
    barrier on non-pay cable TV. Blood is spilled, bones are broken and 
    body parts go flying through the air. This is where the series 
    shines, but when Sunny gets to Lousiana and teams up with teenage boy 
    M.K. (Aramis Knight), the story becomes convoluted, confusing and 
    rather boring. At least it has some strong female characters, which 
    seems to be the new &quot;thing&quot; on TV for the last couple of 
    years (think &quot;Shondaland&quot;), but the story, based on the 
    16th Century Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; lost 
    something in the translation, but at only 6 episodes long this 
    season, it just very well catch on with people interested with 
    martial arts being back on TV (there's an awful lot of wire work on 
    display here, too). It's like a miniature Shaw Brothers movie every 
    week, where there are no subtitles, but people watch them for the 
    martial arts fights alone. This isn't my generation's version of <B><A HREF="kung_fu_tv_1973.htm">KUNG
     FU</A></B> (1972 - 1975), because Kwai Chang Caine (the late David 
    Carradine), was measured and slow when using martial arts (and only 
    used them when he really had to) and showed us that peace was better 
    than violence. This is martial arts for the modern generation, where 
    people expect the action quick and fast, with deadly repercussions no 
    matter the situation. And it does that with aplomb. Too bad there's a 
    story that goes along with it. And one thing that bothers me: Why are 
    the bandits' weapons in the first fight in the series so rusty and 
    Sunny's sword is nice, shiny and polished? Don't bandits in the 
    future care about the weapons that could very well save their lives 
    (but don't in this situation)? It's another contrast between good and 
    evil that doesn't wash for me. (<B>NOTE #1:</B> November 17, 2015: 
    The series debuted with a respectable 6.4 million viewers, but the 
    real test will be when <B>TWD</B> goes on &quot;Winter Hiatus&quot;

    to call it &quot;Repeat December&quot;] in one week. <B>NOTE #2:</B>

    since I was a kid (It's actually based on the novel of the same name 
    by Philip K. Dick.). All you need to ask yourself is this: What would 
    our country be like if Germany and Japan did win World War II? What 
    would our country look like? How would it be governed? Which part of 
    our country would Germany own and what part would Japan own (actually 
    this part makes a lot of sense)? Would there be rebels as part of a 
    Resistance to try and win our freedom back? How would they do it 
    (it's quite ingenious)? And most importantly: <A HREF="jessica_jones_netflix_series_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/jessica jones 2015 netflix ad4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>How
     would we dress and would there be such things as computers, internet 
    and cell phones? I'm not going to give anything away except to say 
    that all of these questions and more will be answered. And the set 
    decorations, especially the way they depict buildings that we know 
    and love and how different they look now, play an important part into 
    making this series believable. Why is it that streaming services have 
    the most unusual and watchable shows being on TV right now (Thank God 
    for my Roku 3!)? I watched all 10 episodes in one night and unlike 
    Malcolm McDowall and his &quot;showhole&quot; remarks about 
    binge-watching (you can't mistaken that voice), I hope this series 
    gets picked-up for a second season. There are still so many 
    unanswered questions. Questions I have been asking myself since I was 
    a kid. Lots of good actors in this, including Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, 
    Rufus Sewell, Rupert Evans, Daniel Roebuck, DJ Qualls (my vote for an 
    Emmy Award&reg; for Best Supporting Actor on a Drama) and, 
    especially, Alexa Davalos. <B>NOTE:</B> Amazon Prime renewed the 
    series for a second season. Good move. They have also revealed that 
    actor Stephen Root is the person of the title.&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp;

    (Who knows, somewhere down the road there may be a crossover 
    episode?). It is adult, violent and sexy. Krysten Ritter portrays the 
    titled character, a former superhero who quit the business due to 
    something awful that happened (which I will leave up to you to 
    discover). After some soul-searching and some very definite anger 
    issues, Jessica Jones opens up her own private investigation business 
    in New York's Hell's Kitchen and begins taking cases, trying her 
    damndest not to use her superhero powers in the process. I have only 
    watched 3 episodes so far (The show mentioned above this one wore me 
    out for the weekend). I'm not a big superhero TV watcher (movies, 
    either), but when something is done well, you appreciate it. Actor 
    Mike Colter, who plays &quot;<A HREF="luke_cage_netflix_tv_series_2016.htm">Luke
     Cage</A>&quot; here, already has his superpowers and will have his 
    own Netflix series&nbsp; beginning September 30, 2016. I especially 
    like David Tennant as &quot;Kilgrave&quot; and it also features 
    Carrie-Anne Moss and Rachael Taylor. And there are explicit sex 
    scenes that almost cross over into X-Rated (not NC-17) territory. 
    Could it be that streaming series are the new incarnation of pay 
    cable series? Only time will tell, but all the major streaming 
    services have already won Emmy Awards&reg; for some of their series. 
    The only thing I don't like about streaming is that internet speeds 
    have not caught up with real High Definition, so the HD on the series 
    (all series) is compressed. If you can wait (but then that would hurt 
    ratings and put further seasons into trouble), buy the Blu-Rays when 
    they are released. I do both, especially if the shows are worth 
    owning. This one is. Actually, both of the last two I reviewed are. (<B>NOTE:</B> <B>JESSICA

    (Thursdays 8:00pm) is just another &quot;DC Universe&quot; comics 
    story that proliferate on TV (especially the CW) right now. Let me 
    make this clear: I will not be watching it or any of the Marvel/DC 
    Universe series, even if they do one day combine the universes. I 
    suppose this show has fanboys drooling, but all it inspires in me is 
    yawns. Most of these comic series will eventually tie into the Marvel 
    and DC Summer blockbusters coming in the next few years (both Marvel 
    and DC have it mapped out completely), which will break the cardinal 
    rule that TV and theatrical films should not be related at the same 
    time. You should not have to watch one without understanding the 
    other. Time for this bullshit to stop. When I became an adult, I put 
    away childish things. Fanboys never learned how to do that because 
    they are easily brainwashed by the publicity machine, especially when 
    they did away with the term &quot;comic book&quot; and replaced it 
    with &quot;graphic novel&quot;, making them seem more adult. Guess 
    what? It's not. There are a few adult &quot;graphic novels&quot; out 
    there, but the majority of them are no different than when I was a 
    thirteen year-old jerking-off to Supergirl into a sock. Now fanboys

    (Mondays 9:00pm, replacing the awful <B><A HREF="minority_report_tv_series_2015.htm">MINOR</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="minority_report_tv_series_2015.htm">I</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><A HREF="minority_report_tv_series_2015.htm">TY
     REPORT</A></B>), based on a supporting character in a DC graphic 
    novel called &quot;The Sandman&quot; written by Neil Gaiman. He was 
    upgraded to leading man status in 2000 with his own comic book (oh, 
    excuse me, graphic novel). The premise is quite ridiculous. Lucifer 
    (Tom Ellis of 2014's USA TV series <B><A HREF="rush_tv_series_2014.htm">RUSH</A></B>,
     which I really liked) becomes bored with his job (Really, Satan 
    becomes bored leading people down the wrong path? And he has a 
    father? Oh, his father is God!) and opens a ritzy Hollywood nightclub 
    where he helps Detective Chloe Decker (Lauren German) solve crimes, 
    while a winged fallen angel named Amenadiel (D.B. Woodside), who was 
    sent by Hell, threatens to battle Lucifer if he doesn't return to 
    that hot place underground. So Lucifer is now a good guy (he cut off 
    his wings and put them inside a crate in a hidden compartment, which 
    is stolen in one episode)? He even pays weekly visits to female 
    psychiatrist Linda Martin (Rachael Harris) as he starts losing his 
    supernatural powers, (but only when he is around Chloe) who becomes 
    infatuated with him and they have sexual encounters after their 
    sessions! That eventually ends when Amenadiel pretends to be a 
    psychiatrist whose office is right next to Linda's and he talks her 
    out of having sex with Lucifer because she is breaking the 
    psychiatrist's code of conduct of not getting involved with her 
    patients. Another comic book character I don't think I'll be 
    watching. At least this series won't be taking place in the &quot;DC 
    Universe&quot;, but that's little help for me since the only 
    superhero show I like is Netflix's <B><A HREF="daredevil_netflix_series_2015.htm">DAREDEVIL</A></B>,
     because he really has no super powers and the show is very mature. 
    Like we need another superhero (if you want to call Lucifer that) 
    show to clog network time. <B>NOTE:</B> The pilot episode was 
    rejiggered from the screener I received. &quot;Lucifer<A HREF="shades_of_blue_tv_series_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/shades of blue 2016 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Morningstar&quot; (&quot;God-given, I'm afraid.&quot;) is not quite 
    the good guy as in the original pilot, but he still works for the 
    good of mankind (But he can't understand kids, especially divorced 
    Det. Decker's little girl Trixie [played adoringly by Scarlett 
    Estevez] who, for some reason, likes Lucifer and hugs him. Lucifer's 
    reaction is priceless). I may watch this series because Tom Ellis 
    gives Lucifer that little twinkle of deviltry in both words and 
    deeds, even when doing good (and he does get to send some people to 
    Hell, but we don't see him do it). Watch how he treats the cop who 
    stops him for speeding (and pay close attention to the car Lucifer 
    drives) just by telling the truth, showing that most of humankind all 
    want the same thing. Also good is Lesley-Ann Brandt as female demon 
    Mazikeen, who runs Lucifer's nightclub (She is working with Amenadiel 
    to return Lucifer to Hell because she doesn't like who he is 
    becoming, but she is also changing, too.) and Kevin Alejandro as 
    Chloe's cop ex-husband Dan, who believes Lucifer is romantically 
    involved with his ex-wife (who he is trying to get back together 
    with) and he is unsettled because he killed his corrupt partner (who 
    went to Hell) and covered it up. Amenadiel brings Dan's ex-partner 
    back to Earth to become Dan's partner again (blackmail is involved) 
    and kill Lucifer so he goes back to Hell. All the pieces fall 
    together as the season progresses. (<B>NOTE:</B> Ever since its

    nearly two-thirds. I'm actually enjoying the series, which means it 
    probably won't be renewed. <B>NOTE #2:</B> Miracles of miracles, FOX 
    has renewed the series for a Second Season on April 7, 2016. This 
    show grew on me like a friendly bacteria and it also did so with the 
    audience. Ratings grew as the series progressed after the small bump 
    in the road. Michael Imperioli will appear regularly as the angel 
    Uriel for Season 2.)&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; Whenever I hear 
    &quot;Jennifer Lopez, Actress&quot;, I laugh out loud and then throw 
    up in my mouth a little (Have you seen <B><A HREF="boy_next_door_2015.htm">THE
     BOY NEXT DOOR</A></B> [2015]? Well, I have and so have the people at

    financial problems, so she begins bribing fellow officers so she can 
    keep her daughter in new clothes and be like other kids. Her daughter 
    is the most important person in her life and she would do anything, 
    including breaking the law, to keep her happy. You know, your typical 
    anti-hero, crooked law enforcement crap. This is a standard crime 
    procedural which people will probably watch after the lead-in program <B><A HREF="black_list_tv_series_2013.htm">THE
     BLACKLIST</A></B>, but I give the series 4 episodes before it is put 
    on &quot;hiatus&quot; (i.e Saturday night showings), Surrounding 
    herself with Emmy Award&reg; winning actors Ray Liotta and Drea De 
    Matteo to cover her terrible acting may work for a couple of 
    episodes, but this series stands a snowball's chance in Hell of 
    lasting the 13 episodes that make up the season. Jennifer Lopez 
    should stick to singing, but she (as well as other singers) always 
    have to try to be actors, Very few of them ever succeed (Kris 
    Kristofferson, Henry Rollins and Iggy Pop are exceptions. Lopez has 
    starred in some good theatrical films, but she always had actors like 
    George Clooney to cover for her.). If this wasn't produced by her own 
    production company and having a deal with NBC (thanks to <B><A HREF="voice_tv_series_2011.htm">THE
     VOICE</A></B>), this series would never make it to TV. There is so 
    much good stuff waiting to be aired and shit like this gets shown 
    instead. It it any wonder people are moving to streaming? <B>NOTE:</B> 
    Believe it or not, this series is doing very well in the ratings and 
    raised some eyebrows when co-star Ray Liotta's character revealed he 
    was gay and kissed a man romantically on the lips and it has been 
    renewed for a second season. Hell, I can't be right all the 
    time.&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; USA's <B><A HREF="colony_tv_series_2016.htm">COLONY</A></B> 
    (Thursdays 10:00pm) is a move in the right direction for the channel 
    for showing more diverse, different TV series. This one may sound 
    ridiculous, but the storytelling is great. In the near future, the 
    city of Los Angeles is suddenly walled off <A HREF="colony_tv_series_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/colony 2016 series premiere tv ad2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(in
     impenetrable metal) into three separate sections and father Will 
    Bowman (Josh Holloway) and his wife Katie (Sarah Wayne Callies) are 
    cut off from their son, who is walled-off on the other side of town. 
    Will tries many times to be reunited with his son, but the walls are 
    impossible to do any damage to. Then he is approached by his block's 
    proxy governor, who promises Will that he and his wife will be with 
    their son again if Will agrees to spy on the underground rebellion 
    and report back to him. Even though the series sounds like nothing 
    special, it taps into everyone's fear of being watched, as the people 
    in these sections have absolutely no privacy and have no say in the 
    matter. The biggest question is why these walls were erected and why 
    people are purposely split up from their families and surveilled. You 
    may think you know the answer (My first thought is that is was a 
    government experiment to see how far people will go to be with their 
    families), but there are more nefarious plans afoot. I just wish the 
    USA Network would quit spoiling the surprise with their commercials 
    for the series. This practice goes on much too often on nearly every 
    channel. The viewing public would like to be surprised every now and 
    then, so I hope networks get the message and quit giving away major 
    plot points, even going as far as to show scenes from the finale of 
    the next episode. If loss of privacy bothers you (just by reading 
    this review, your internet provider can give your address and phone 
    number to anyone with a supoena and even tell them if you are on 
    line) and this series plays into those fears better than <B><A HREF="person_of_interest_tv_series_2011.htm">PERSON

    worse time slot, though. I reserve it for <B><A HREF="elementary_tv_series_2012.htm">ELEMENTARY</A></B>,
     so it looks like another series for my TIVO DVR (which is getting 
    quite a workout this year!). Based on the first three episode 
    screeners I received, this show is a winner. (<B>NOTE:</B> Renewed 
    for a Second Season which will premiere sometime in 2017). On the 
    other hand, SyFy's <B><A HREF="magicians_2016_tv_series_2016.htm">THE MAGICIANS</A></B> 
    (Mondays 10:00pm) is described as a &quot;sexier Harry Potter&quot; 
    (with young adults instead of kids; it's actually based on the YA 
    novel of the same name by Lev Grossman; he has two more novels in the 
    series.) set in New York. That was a turn-off for me immediately and 
    since SyFy didn't send me any screeners, I expect that they don't 
    have much faith in it either. On IMDb, people who have read the novel 
    seem to like it. Those who haven't think it is crap. There are too 
    many YA series and superhero series clogging the airwaves (like MTV's 
    new <B><A HREF="shannara_chronicles_tv_series_2016.htm">THE SHANNARA CHRONICLES</A></B> 
    [Tuesdays 10:00pm], already renewed for a second season, even though 
    the best ratings the episodes could get was 1.77 million people). I 
    expect this one will last about 4 episodes. It's just another CW-like 
    show full of young people; old enough to have sex, but stupid enough 
    to make idiotic life decisions. <B>NOTE:</B> SyFy has already given 
    the series a second season, only four episodes into the first 
    season.&nbsp;If this is the new look of SyFy, count me out. <B>*</B>&nbsp;

    Alzheimers asks him to get him a box off the top shelf. It's not only

    9:30pm). Jane Lynch can either be funny or aggravating. In this 
    series, Lynch plays a hard-drinking fairy godmother who may be an 
    angel or may be a demon from Hell. In this sitcom, Lynch is 
    aggravating. It's like spending a night in Hell with a terrible case 
    of jock itch (or a yeast infection). Expect quick cancellations on 
    both even though <B>SUPERSTORE</B> did better than expected in the 
    ratings. NBC needs a sitcom hit, so they may give the series a chance 
    to catch on (Seems stupid is &quot;in&quot; because the series was 
    picked up for a second season on February 23, 2016). CBS, on the 
    other hand, has has much better luck with sitcoms than other networks 
    (although ABC &amp; FOX have their share, too) and may give Jane 
    Lynch's show a chance because it follows the well-received multiple 
    Emmy Award&reg; winning sitcom <B><A HREF="mom_tv_series_2013.htm">MOM</A></B>

    comedy series? It shows on Amazon Prime and I tried watching an 
    episode and was very unimpressed. There are much better comedies in 
    TV. This is one of the times the Golden Globes&reg; got it wrong. It 
    was like they were trying to push streaming shows on people that 
    don't use them yet, since only two non-streaming shows (both HBO pay

    calling <B><A HREF="citizen_kane_1941.htm">CITIZEN KANE</A></B>

    (Mondays 9:00pm; First Episode Sunday, January 24, 2016 10:21pm) 
    opening again in a new episode since 2002. The first episode sets up 
    the relationship between all the characters (although I hear The Lone 
    Gunmen and Annabeth Gish as Monica Reyes will make appearances in 
    future episodes, even though The Lone Gunmen died in the original 
    series). The premise for the first episode was conspiracy-centric 
    (But not all of them are). Dana Scully is now working as a surgeon to 
    give children born with birth defects (such as no ears, which makes 
    them look alien, which is no accident) a normal life. Fox Mulder has 
    been in hiding and is practically impossible to get in touch with. It 
    seems he has become what some people consider bi-polar (including 
    Scully, who has separated from Mulder, even though they had a child 
    together, who was given up for adoption). That is, until Scully gets 
    a text message from Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is still with 
    the FBI, that she and Mulder need to see him. This brings Mulder out 
    of seclusion (he eventually gives Skinner his cell phone number) as 
    Skinner tells them to contact Tad O'Malley (Joel McHale, in a 
    dramatic performance that may surprise you), a conspiracy theorist 
    who has a popular web site that has made him a rich man (What he says 
    about Bill O'Reilly is a hoot). Of course, Scully plays the woman of 
    reason, as Tad takes them to a young woman who claims she has been 
    abducted many times and <A HREF="x_files_reboot_tv_series_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/x-files 2016 series reboot series premiere tv ad20 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>she
     has alien DNA in her blood. She may be the key to the whole 
    conspiracy. Scully takes blood and DNA samples, while Tad takes 
    Mulder to a secret facility where scientists have built an alien 
    spacecraft (that the government knows nothing about) that uses a 
    propulsion system that will put oil companies out of business for 
    good. The spacecraft can also become completely invisible. All this 
    technology was taken from the crash site of an alien spacecraft in 
    Roswell, New Mexico in 1947 and reverse-engineered. It is then that 
    Mulder learns the truth: All those years he thought that aliens were 
    abducting people was wrong. It was actually a top secret cabal in the 
    government who were taking the people using alien technology from the 
    downed spacecraft to use in experiments to form a new human/alien 
    race. Yes, there are aliens, but they have never abducted a single 
    person. Scully becomes even more concerned with Mulder's new theory 
    and mental condition when the tests she ran on the young woman turn 
    out to be normal, but she comes around when she has the tests run 
    again and it comes back with alien abnormalities. By that time, it is 
    too late. The government has destroyed the spacecraft (killing all 
    the scientists in the process), Tad's web site is no longer up and 
    working and the young woman is driving down the road, when a 
    government alien spacecraft hovers over her car, knocks out the 
    electrical system and shoots a green beam down at the automobile, 
    making it blow up (she opens the door and tries to escape before the 
    car blows up, but only future episodes will tell us whether she makes 
    it out alive). The final shot is of an old man being told that the 
    X-Files is officially being put back into commission with Mulder and 
    Scully in charge. As the camera pans around, we see it's The 
    Cigarette Smoking Man, C.G.B. Spender (William B. Davis), who now 
    smokes Morley cigarettes through a hole in his throat. This was a 
    fantastic beginning to what is sadly only a 6-episode &quot;Event 
    Series&quot; and it is full of references to back episodes, both in 
    photos (Mulder's narration opening brings back so many fond memories, 
    because this still is my favorite series on television of all time) 
    and items all over the place. You just have to look for them. I 
    especially loved how the earless children Scully helps look like 
    aliens, which psychologically gives meaning to her work that she has 
    really never left the X-Files behind and how Mulder kicks and tears 
    the &quot;I Want To Believe&quot; poster after he sees the state of 
    disrepair (and all his files stolen) at the X-Files headquarters at 
    the FBI. Mulder looks beaten-down and hopeless, but once he sees the 
    spacecraft and touches it with his own hands, you can see the 
    transformation in his eyes. Getting Scully on-board is much harder, 
    but that is what <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE X-FILES</A></B> 
    (1993 - 2002) was always about. Hopefully, there will be more 
    episodes to come in later years, because the first episode flew by 
    like it was one minute long. Although the new premise seems to 
    contradict the first X-Files movie (1998), just ignore it and go 
    along for the ride. Be on the lookout for Rance Howard as Mulder's 
    new contact, who was at the Roswell crash when it happened and took 
    away a dead alien after a Man In Black and his soldiers pump it full 
    of bullets as it tries to crawl away (there are a few flashback 
    sequences which clear up a lot of the mystery). One thing that pissed 
    me off, though: I know FOX wants ratings, but to show the first 
    episode 20 minutes late because of an unneeded post-football ceremony 
    (which should have only taken 5 minutes) and burning off two episodes 
    in the same week is just an idiotic move on FOX's part (To add insult 
    to injury, they needed Jeff Gordon on the panel to shill for FOX's 
    new pact with NASCAR!). Some people don't stay up that late to watch 
    TV, they DVR it and will discover that the last 20 minutes of the 
    first episode are missing. I stayed up and purposely made sure that I 
    watched the show, but I gave it an extra hour on my TIVO because it 
    has a DVD-R burner and I want to add this show to my library with 
    original commercials. I will be buying the disc set when it comes 
    out, but as the years go by, sometimes the commercials seem very 
    outdated and funny, as I learned when I watched the original season 
    that I taped on VHS back in 1993-1994 (Even though I own the entire 
    series on disc). I can't say how pleased I am that the series has 
    returned. It's like seeing your best friend in the whole wide world 
    for the first time in 14 years. I nearly cried when I heard the 
    opening theme, which has not changed since the original series, 
    except for some names (this is considered Season 10). <B>NOTE: </B>The
     opener got a great 13.5 million viewers (for that time of night, 
    nearly unheard of), not accounting for DVR recordings, which should 
    put it near the 16 - 18 million viewers mark (actually over 20 
    million). The second episode aired (to 9.8 million live viewers) was 
    actually the fifth one they filmed. It was a &quot;monster of the 
    week&quot; episode, which harkened me back to the earlier seasons of 
    the series, only more gruesome (And this series raised the bar for 
    gruesome in the 90's. Remember &quot;Home&quot; and the ruckus it 
    caused?). Watch what you do with those letter openers, kids! <B>NOTE #2:</B> 
    Just like all popular series, some fans think the new series stinks 
    because the first episode tried to cram too much information into it! 
    These mental midgets should begin watching <B>SESAME STREET</B> and 
    work their way up to adult fare. I had no problem keeping up with the 
    first episode. Some people on social media sites<A HREF="family_tv_series_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/family 2016 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    should have their internet privileges taken away. But first, they 
    have to move out of their parents' basement, put on some pants and 
    learn to survive on their own (Right-wing ultra-Conservative website 
    Breitbart.com writer Warner Todd Huston accused Chris Carter of 
    making Fox Mulder anti-Conservative because of his attitude and 
    dislike towards conspiracy theorist Tad O'Malley! This jerk then goes 
    on to say that this clearly reflects the &quot;liberalism&quot; of 
    the show's writers. This is the ridiculous shit that the internet 
    spews out like puke; akin to eating too many White Castle &quot;murder
     burgers&quot; after a drunken night on the town and spending the 
    rest of the early morning bent over the porcelain goddess.). <B>NOTE #3:</B>

    presumed dead for the past ten years and the problems it causes for 
    the family, including the mother, who is running for Governor (played 
    with a sense of urgency by Joan Allen). The entire family has secrets 
    of their own to hide (the husband is secretly having an affair with 
    the female detective who determined the son was dead and killed by a 
    neighbor) and the boy's sister would rather not have him around. The 
    series rotates between ten years ago and today and gives us clues

    mystery of whether the boy is actually their son will be revealed 
    halfway through the 13 episode first (and probably final) season, but

     GOOD WIFE</A></B> and <B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE 
    WALKING DEAD</A></B>. Not a great way to get viewers. It may help in 
    the beginning to show the first episode on a Thursday, but moving it 
    immediately to Sunday is a no-win situation. Too bad. It had 
    potential based on the three episode screener I have received. (<B>NOTE:</B> 
    On May 12, 2016, known now as &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;, this 
    series was cancelled.). The second ABC series is the adult Biblical 
    drama <B><A HREF="of_kings_and_prophets_tv_series_2016.htm">OF KINGS 
    AND PROPHETS</A></B> (Tuesdays 10:00pm), which mixes fictional 
    stories with &quot;real&quot; events that happened in the Bible 
    (that's if you believe the Bible is real and is not just a big book 
    of fairy tales). I know that these type of stories are &quot;in&quot; 
    now, but I took one look at the first hour and gave up on it. Let's 
    just say it is not my cup of tea and hasn't been for quite some time. 
    The devoutly religious are also going to be offended since it 
    bastardizes their beliefs in ways that won't please them (The others 
    will probably be asleep considering their age since most of the 
    audience for this type of show live down South and dream of Donald 
    Trump being President). I really have no idea who this series was 
    made for, so look for it to disappear quickly. The series has a 
    problematic history and the pilot was completely reshot. Not a good 
    sign from above. <B>NOTE:</B> The network pulled the series after two 
    episodes and cancelled it.&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; Spring TV Series I 
    won't be giving the normal review space: First off is <B><A HREF="motive_tv_series_2013.htm">MOTIVE</A></B> 
    (Fridays 10:00pm), which is actually a Canadian TV Series that 
    started in 2013. The USA Network had a couple of binge-watching 
    weekends for U.S. audiences to catch up on the 3 seasons that they 
    missed (it was basically unannounced unless you watch the USA Network 
    a lot) and are showing episodes from the current Season 4 now. I 
    don't have time to watch over 50 episodes to catch up, but the series 
    lets you know who the killer is right off the bat. What the 
    detectives have to find out is why the person committed the crime. 
    It's just a reversal of most police procedurals, but the Canadians 
    love the series, ABC was supposed to debut the series in the U.S. the 
    same year the Canadians did, but they ended up passing on it. (<B>NOTE:</B> 
    USA moved the series to Sundays at 10:00PM, which usually means that 
    it will be dropped soon.)&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; SyFy's <B><A HREF="hunters_tv_series_2016.htm">HUNTERS</A></B> 
    (Mondays 10:00pm) is a cheaply made-in-Australia series, based on 
    Whitley Strieber's best selling novel &quot;Alien Hunter&quot;, about 
    a PTSD ex-FBI agent whose wife is kidnapped, so he is recruited by 
    the &quot;Exo-Terrorism Unit&quot; (ETU) to fight alien terrorists

     is Executive Produced by Gale Anne Hurd, it is instantly forgettable 
    and will remind you of many series that came before it. Don't look 
    for this to last for more than one 13-episode season.&nbsp;<B>NOTE:</B> 
    I was right. SyFy cancelled the series after one season on July 9, 
    2016.&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; Last year SyFy promised audiences that 
    they were going back to their roots. Based on their latest crop of 
    new shows I think they lied to us. Case in point: <B><A HREF="wynonna_earp_tv_series_2016.htm">WYNONNA
     EARP</A></B> (Fridays 10:00pm), a supernatural comic adaptation 
    (What isn't nowadays?) about the great granddaughter of Wyatt Earp 
    (Melanie Scrofano) fighting demons and other nasties that roam the 
    Earth. She's also a quick shot like her ancestor, but she has a 
    special Colt pistol that sends demons and other creatures to Hell and 
    keeps justice alive in the world. This is just plain old bad and 
    proves that some comics should just stay comics. My prediction: 
    Thirteen episodes and gone. I mean, what's next, <B>WYNONNA JUDD, 
    RED-HEADED VAMPIRE HUNTER</B>? <B>UPDATE:</B> SyFy renewed the series 
    for a second season, proving that there is no accounting for taste. 
    But they cut the episode order down to ten. The only new SyFy show I

    too.; SyFy's <B><A HREF="killjoys_tv_series_2015.htm">KILLJOYS</A></B>,

     AMC's Summer series <B><A HREF="preacher_tv_series_2016.htm">PREACHER</A></B> 
    (Sundays 10:00pm) is another adaptation taken from a DC Vertigo 
    comics series (Others include <B><A HREF="constantine_tv_series_2014.htm">CONSTANTINE</A></B>,

     and I'm glad to say that I am enjoying the hell out of it. Since it 
    is on AMC, it is bloody as hell (Which asks the question: Why do they 
    cut extreme violence from the movies they show?), well acted and 
    written. Since comic actor Seth Rogan directed and wrote a couple of 
    episodes, as well as being one of the Producers, to say it was a 
    shock is an understatement, but he is a fan of the graphic novel 
    series and does it the justice it deserves. To explain the plot is 
    like trying to explain the color purple to a blind person, but you 
    will be enthralled by each episode and the characters within. The ten 
    episode first season is a great watch and I am glad that AMC renewed 
    the series for a second season, expanding the episode order to 13. It 
    seems the only graphic novel series I like are those people who are 
    not superheroes, but men of mystery who are imbued with supernatural 
    powers or learn to adapt when losing one of their senses. No super 
    powers like amazing strength, the ability to fly or chock full of 
    technological devices. This series has none of that and therefore 
    holds my interest thanks to good stories and the acting abilities of 
    Dominic Cooper, Joseph Gilgun, Ruth Negga and Ian Colletti as 
    &quot;Arseface&quot;, a character I guarantee you have never seen the 
    likes of before. Worth watching.&nbsp; <B>*&nbsp; New Summer Series 
    You Should Be Watching:</B> Actually, I only found ones on streaming 
    and pay cable, the first being Netflix's <B><A HREF="stranger_things_2016_netflix_series.htm">STRANGER
     THINGS</A></B>, a nice touch of 80's nostalgia (but not too much, 
    although living through the 1980's helps you enjoy the series more) 
    that is like a weird mixture of <B><A HREF="twin_peaks_tv_series.htm">TWIN
     PEAKS</A></B> (1990 - 1991, 2017) and <B><A HREF="eerie_indiana_tv_series_1991-1992.htm">EERIE,
     INDIANA</A></B> (1991 - 1992). It can be enjoyed by both kids and 
    adults alike (make sure your kids can handle some adult themes and a 
    smattering of blood), yet still raise goosebumps on the most jaded of 
    horror freaks. The story is about a mother (an excellent Winona 
    Ryder), whose son disappears, so she, the town's sheriff (David 
    Harbour) and the son's strange friends begin a search for him, which 
    brings out a whole lot of secrets about the town, some which cannot 
    be explained (at least not yet). The eight episode first season I 
    binge-watched went by so fast, I wish there were more episodes to 
    watch (but better 8 excellent episodes than 13 so-so episodes) and 
    from what I read, both Stephen King and Guillermo del Toro are huge 
    fans of the series, too. I wish all Summer series used this much 
    imagination (and plenty of 80's Easter Eggs) to entertain viewers. 
    All I can say to Netflix is thanks and please renew this series for a 
    second season (It has been announced on August 30, 2016 that a Second 
    Season has been greenlit. <B>NOTE:</B> On January 29, 2017 it won the 
    prestigious SAG Award&reg; for Best Drama Series On TV.). It seems 
    that streaming services are responsible for bringing us some 
    outstanding series in the past 3 or 4 years and take chances that 
    most networks won't. And it has nothing to do with censors.; I also 
    kinda like HBO's <B><A HREF="night_of_tv_series_2016.htm">THE NIGHT OF</A></B> 
    (Sundays 9:00pm), a complex mystery that slowly unfolds in telling us 
    whether a Pakistani man taken into custody is guilty of the bloody 
    murder of a woman, but it only reminds me that there will be no 
    Season 3 of <B><A HREF="true_detective_tv_series_2014.htm">TRUE DETECTIVE</A></B> 
    (Turns out there will be a Season 3, starring Mahershala Ali. The air 
    date has yet to be set, but it will be sometime in 2018.. Nic 
    Pizzolatto is the sole writer of the series, with the exception of 
    episode 4 which he co-wrote with David Milch.), so I am deducting 
    points for that fact alone (Hey, I'm human!. I can't be the only one 
    who loved Season 2 of that series!). The new series is limited to 8 
    episodes, so there will not be a Season 2, but Riz Ahmed as the 
    imprisoned man and John Turturro as his attorney (which was supposed 
    to be played by the late James Gandolfini, who still gets Executive 
    Producer credit) are compelling and excellent.&nbsp;There is also an 
    unaired pilot which was filmed in 2013, so hopefully it will be part 
    of the DVD/Blu-Ray set.; I almost passed on Cinemax's <B><A HREF="outcast_tv_series_2016.htm">OUTCAST</A></B>

    terror (and some that make you go &quot;Ewwww!&quot;) and the 
    introduction of Brent Spiner as Sidney, who may be the Devil himself, 
    greatly enhances the proceedings. The story is about divorced dad 
    Kyle Barnes (Patrick Fugit), who as a young boy, saw his Mother 
    possessed by a demon and something strange happens to him (we are 
    given glimpses of the incident in pieces in every episode). Now a 
    man, a not-normal Kyle joins forces with your not-usual Reverend 
    Anderson (an excellent Philip Glenister, who smokes like a chimney 
    and says &quot;fuck&quot; a lot) to perform exorcisms in his 
    demon-possessed town (Why the town has so many demons will probably 
    be explained in the already approved Second Season, renewed before 
    one episode was even shown), while Kyle tries to piece his childhood 
    together (he forgot most of it, but we see the flashbacks he 
    remembers). As the series progresses, we get to know and care about 
    these people (they aren't cliched like those in <B>THE WALKING DEAD</B> 
    and Lee Tergesen should be nominated for an Emmy Award&reg; as a 
    Guest Star for the one episode he is in) and white-haired Brent 
    Spiner is so evil (He carves a pentagram into the Reverend's chest to 
    make the holy man look crazy in the townspeople's eyes. And it 
    works!), you will have a hard time remembering he was &quot;Data&quot;

     TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION</A></B>. A nice little detour from the 
    lazy days of Summer. A thinking person's horror series. <B>NOTE:</B> 
    Be aware that the first episode of the series was never shown on 
    Cinemax. It was shown exclusively on FOX in Europe and Japan and on 
    Facebook Live on May 20, 2016 (making it an 11-episode season). We 
    here in the U.S. will have to wait for its eventual disc release to 
    see it (unless you were foolish enough to subscribe to Facebook 
    Live). I pay for Cinemax monthly, so to make them exclude the first 
    episode is not kosher (From what I understand, this not-seen 11th 
    episode starred Patrick Fugit only and none of the other characters 
    of the show were introduced except his mother. It tried to explain 
    Kyle's background as a child and an adult and his new &quot;gift&quot;
     as a demon expeller [50% of his and the Reverend's 
    &quot;exorcisms&quot; leave the possessed person as a vegetable, 
    which is explained in a later episode] . It was written by Robert 
    Kirkman.). Maybe that is why the first episode I saw confused me and 
    nearly stopped me from watching this excellent series.&nbsp;<B>

    (Mondays 10:00pm; switched to Sundays 10:00pm) would probably be 
    quite entertaining in any other year but this one, but this political 
    satire about alien ants (You read that right) eating away at 
    politicians' brains in Washington, D.C. to make them more willing to 
    pass bills that do more harm to humans than good, just can't beat 
    what is really going on during this Presidential Election year. Made 
    by the creators of my late, great guilty pleasure <B><A HREF="good_wife_tv_series_2009-2016.htm">THE
     GOOD WIFE</A></B> (2009 - 2016), this series has a great cast 
    (including a wonderfully insane performance by Tony Shaloub), but the 
    storyline is old hat and plays more like <B><A HREF="invasion_of_the_body_snatchers_1956.htm">INVASION
     OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</A></B> than any political satire should. When 
    you have Donald Trump as the real Republican candidate for P.O.T.U.S. 
    and there is a good chance he will win (Yes, people are stupid), how 
    can alien ants compete with that? Add that to the fact that the show 
    was switched to Sunday nights so that CBS could show live coverage 
    for the Republican and Democratic Conventions and you have the 
    biggest satire of all: a series about alien ants taking over 
    politicians' brains being trumped by what is guaranteed to be the 
    strangest Republican Convention of all time (Already, Melanie Trump, 
    who is The Donald's wife, was accused of plagiarizing paragraphs in 
    her keynote speech to a speech given by Michelle Obama during the 
    2008 Democratic Convention, in her introduction from her husband. And 
    it looks like reports are correct. And then Scott Baio [?!?!] came on 
    stage to say, &quot;Let's make America America again!&quot; I guess 
    this has-been wants slavery back. If this is Trump's idea of &quot;big
     stars&quot; coming out to support him [Let's not forget gay-bashing 
    Willie Robertson of <B><A HREF="duck_dynasty_tv_series_2012.htm">DUCK DYNASTY</A></B>&nbsp;
     and former action star-turned-reality show hack Antonio Sabato Jr. 
    also making speeches and both quoting from the <A HREF="american_gothic_tv_series_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american gothic 2016 series premiere tv ad2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Bible.],
     his idea and my idea of &quot;stars&quot; are a long way apart. Add 
    the fact that Trump used Queen's song &#147;We Are the Champions&#148;
     for his entrance even though Brian May of the band told him not to 
    use it months ago and the Republican Convention is turning out to be 
    quite the circus. And this is just the first day!). No series can 
    beat that plot. The series was ill-timed and ill-advised, just like 
    Donald Trump. (<B>NOTE:</B> CBS cancelled the series on October 18, 
    2016.); CBS's <B><A HREF="american_gothic_tv_series_2016.htm">AMERICAN
     GOTHIC</A></B> (Wednesdays 10:00pm) is set in Boston and filled with 
    one of the most disfunctional and cliched amount of characters you 
    are bound to find in any TV series or films (the sociopathic Mother; 
    the bisexual politician; the drug addict; the misfit loner; the 
    troubled wife of a detective, etc.). The major plot is about a blue 
    blood Boston family who, after the rich father dies, find out that 
    one of their family members may be the notorious serial murderer 
    known as &quot;The Silver Bell Killer&quot;. We are supposed to 
    figure out which person it is for the 13 episode run, but after 
    watching two episodes of this soap opera mystery, my brain started to 
    hurt and I couldn't stand to watch it any more. It stretches out what 
    should be a two hour movie into 13 separate hours. I have much better 
    things to do with my time and by the looks of the show's ratings, so 
    does most of the other viewing public (<B>NOTE:</B> The show was 
    cancelled by CBS on October 18, 2016). Too bad the show is not a 
    continuation of <A HREF="american_gothic_tv_series.htm">the 
    underrated 1995 - 1996 series with the same name</A>, which I loved. 
    This one I hate. Even though the networks are showing more original 
    scripted series during the Summer (the second seasons of <B><A HREF="aquarius_tv_series_2015.htm">AQUARIUS</A></B> 
    [still a mesmerizing 1960's-set series, but low ratings have moved it 
    to Saturdays, with no hope of a Season Three] and <B><A HREF="zoo_tv_series_2015.htm">ZOO</A></B> 
    [which has gone off the rails this season, yet CBS announced on 
    August 10, 2016 that it was renewed for a Third Season] included), 
    the audiences seem to be more interested in reality series, like <B>BIG
     BROTHER</B> (Which teaches kids to be back-stabbing bastards and 
    bitches.) and <B><A HREF="american_ninja_warrior_tv_series_2009.htm">AMERICAN
     NINJA WARRIOR</A></B> (Which teaches kids that exercize is a good 
    thing and the show is sometimes nail-bitingly heart-pounding feats of 
    strength and stamina when it is not padding out its weekly two-hour 
    running time with background filler and talk, talk, talk. The show 
    would impress me more if Michael Dudikoff were one of the co-hosts.) 
    and old daytime game shows turned into new nighttime series, than 
    they are in original scripted series. Soon the Summer will be a 
    wasteland of reality TV and reruns again. This still proves one thing 
    to me that I have said over and over: People are stupid. This is also 
    the end of my thoughts on the 2015 - 2016 TV Season. Only a little 
    more than a month away to the 2016 - 2017 TV Season! Stay tuned. 
    Believe me, everything popular will become unpopular again. same old, 
    same old. The problems with networks is that they are not showing 
    repeats of shows I wanted to see and have replaced them with reality 
    shows. I remember as a kid that every series was repeated during the 
    Summer and I got to see the shows I wanted to.</FONT></FONT></P>

     you ever seen a TV commercial that pissed you off so much that you 
    wanted to kick-in your TV screen? The latest one is for the disease 
    HPV (Human Papillomavirus). The commercial blames mothers and fathers 
    for their children getting this obscure form of cancer especially 
    since there is an innoculation for it. The fact that the commercials 
    only uses actor portrayals is the first tip-off that they <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hpv vaccine photo2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="&quot;Mom. Dad. I'm going to fuck my soccer teammate in the ass tonight. Did I get the HPV Vaccine?&quot;" BORDER="0">couldn't
     find any real teenager with HPV to talk about the cancer. Maybe 
    there aren't enough of them to really tell the truth (The commercial 
    mentions matter-of-factly that most children never get HPV) or maybe 
    they are just ashamed. The second tip-off is that they don't even 
    mention the name of the drug company that produces the drug 
    (&quot;Just go to your doctor, ask about this disease and what can be 
    done for your child.&quot;). Still, the commercial has some pre-teen 
    female and male child actors asking their parents: &quot;Did you 
    know? Mom? Dad?&quot; or &quot;Right? Mom? Dad?&quot;, like their 
    parents wanted them dead. Making parents feel guilty about their own 
    children is about as low as you can go to sell drugs. And the 
    commercial plays all day and night long on nearly every channel, 
    telling me that this isn't a PSA (they would mention it as a 
    cancerous STD), but a commercial by some pharmaceutical company with 
    deep pockets. Oh, and the most major omission of this commercial? 
    Kids and teens can only get HPV if they have vaginal, anal, or oral 
    sex with someone who has the virus. It is an STD. Funny how the 
    commercial doesn't mention that isn't it? Shame, shame on them for 
    trying to sell a drug that children don't really need and leaving out 
    the biggest cause of HPV. I looked this up before I wrote that. 
    &quot;Did you know that? Unnamed drug company? Right?&quot;. And not 
    to leave adults out for a vaccination, there is a commercial that 
    advises all adults to get vaccinated for Hepatitis C (HEP C) because 
    1 in 30 adults have HEP C and don't even know it. Another cheap scare 
    tactic.. Damn Big Pharm companies will do anything to scare people to 
    get mainly unneeded vaccinations. And while we are on the subject of 
    TV commercials, let me ask you this: Why do the writers have to 
    combine or make up words to sell a product? When did an ex-husband 
    become a &quot;was-band&quot;? When did female underwear (bras &amp; 
    panties) become &quot;underpinnings&quot;? Why is it that when you 
    use a certain toilet paper, a female spokeswoman asks if you will go 
    &quot;commando&quot; to prove how good it is? And why are the guys 
    and gals she asks wearing white pants? Why is it that a snack food 
    that both children and grown-ups likes makes them &quot;kidults&quot;.
     What about the candy bar company who labels people as 
    &quot;dimpatient&quot; or &quot;confulish&quot; because they don't 
    think correctly because they are hungry (Especially the nude male 
    model who thinks a chemistry class is actually a drawing class and 
    splashes his face with hydrochloric acid because he thinks it is 
    cologne as he walks out the door, complaining that it burns. We here 
    in the real world call him retarded.)? And Skippy Peanut Butter is 
    only made with &quot;fun&quot; peanuts; the &quot;not so fun&quot; 
    peanuts end up downstairs with a couple of bored looking losers 
    eating them? There are dozens more commercials out there that do the 
    same thing, trying to create words that they hope will become part of 
    our vocabulary lexicon and situations that will never happen, but all 
    they do is show me a sense of laziness on the advertising agency's 
    part. I remember when some commercials were funny (the Cheez-It 
    commercials are still funny), but it does not surprise me now that 
    viewers will find any means possible to skip commercials. This does 
    not count certain networks that will not let certain sentences pass 
    their censors, such as the trailer for the new Jason<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/v.i.poo photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="242" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="V.I.Poo. Never take a shit again and embarass yourself at a friend's house or restaurant. It doesn't stop smelly farts, though." BORDER="2"> 
    Bourne film, where on cable the trailer has the line, &quot;Jesus 
    Christ, it's Jason Bourne!&quot;, while on regular networks the line 
    is changed to &quot;Oh my God, it's Jason Bourne!&quot; Now we just 
    need another line change where the Holy Ghost is mentioned, such as 
    &quot;Holy Ghost, it's Jason Bourne!&quot; This type of line 
    replacement happens more than you know. Filming different lines for 
    different channels has been going on for quite a few years. My least 
    favorite commercial: &quot;I always thought I was German. I wore 
    lederhosen, danced in a German dance group, but found very little 
    Germans in my family tree. That is until I used %$#*^ *&amp;^$%#@ DNA 
    kit and when it came back, I found out I was Scottish. I replaced my 
    lederhosen with a kilt, told all my Germen friends to go fuck their 
    Nazi selves and now dance in a dress.&quot; I hope you get hit in the 
    nuts with and extremely fast golf ball. Who gives up what they 
    believed all their life with a simple (and extremely expensive) DNA 
    kit? Who gives up all their German friends? Who would want this guy 
    as a friend? He comes off as an extremely selfish guy on TV. Or how 
    about Television preacher Peter Popoff's commercial for his &quot;Free
     Miracle Spring Water&quot;, which promises you lots of money when 
    you drink it (but first have to talk to one of Popoff's 
    &quot;associates&quot; to tell them why you need the money)? More 
    like Peter Popoff's Ministry will get more money so he can upgrade 
    his mansion after you call the number on the screen (they shame you 
    for a donation). It is a pathetic commercial because it caters to the 
    lower income crowd, where obviouslly lower-income black and white 
    people praise the water and say that they got up to &quot;100 
    G's&quot; just by drinking the water. And did you see the commercial 
    for <B>V.I.Poo</B>? A spray you squirt into the toilet before you 
    take a crap? I never laughed so hard in my life, especially when they 
    showed animations of turds (or &quot;donuts&quot; as the female host 
    calls them. She then later, in a new commercial, called them the 
    &quot;Devil's donuts&quot; because anything that comes out of your 
    ass must be the product of Satan!) floating in a toilet. At first I 
    thought it was a joke commercial ala <B><A HREF="saturday_night_live_tv_series_1975.htm">SNL</A></B>,
     but it really exists. No more shit smell to embarass you when you 
    use someone else's bathroom! I did a little investigation on the 
    product and found out it costs $85.00 a bottle! For that price, I'll 
    shit in your bathroom sink and let everyone smell it. <B>Update:</B> 
    The latest V.I. Poo commercial shows a little kid catching Santa 
    Claus taking a shit in their bathroom on Christmas Eve! And lets not 
    forget the guy who likes to spank his lunch, while a female voice 
    comes on and says, &quot;Food you want to fork.&quot; Bringing us 
    closer to saying &quot;fuck&quot; on TV. Also, on a recent Dove 
    commercial, one real-life female person screams out &quot;Oh my God, 
    it's Dove-a!&quot; Lady, &quot;Dove&quot; is only one syllable, not 
    two. Have you ever heard a tv commercial say &quot;Crap&quot;? Well 
    you will on a recent cell phone commercial. How about a wife yelling 
    at her husband by saying 'Go Make Dinner!!!&quot; all because she 
    spends too much for shoes on the Internet. I am all for equality for 
    women, but this is the wrong way to do it. I think the company 
    selling the shoes thought so, too and changed her final line to 
    something softer. How come each preview for a reality show on WE has 
    somebody saying the &quot;F&quot; word that is bleeped out? I bought 
    a My Pillow based on the TV Commercial. It costs nearly $100.00 for 
    two pillows on their i<A HREF="http://www.mypillow.com">nternet site</A> 
    and the commercial fails to mention that it is their special 
    pillowcases that keep the pillow cool. Two pillows and pillowcases 
    cost me nearly $150.00! Shipping is Free, but it will still take 8 to 
    10 weeks for them to arrive. Also, shame on The Shriners Hospital for 
    shaming people if they don't contribute $19.00 a month to help 
    children in wheelchairs. those with missing limbs or 
    &quot;flipper&quot; children. They actually go as far as to say that 
    we don't care for children with disabilities if we don't contribute 
    monthly. They try to tug at the heartstrings, but do they really have 
    to show a woman with burns over 90% of her body or children with 
    hands where their shoulder should be? And don't forget according to 
    the newest candy commercial: &quot;Get layered&quot;!</FONT></FONT></P>
