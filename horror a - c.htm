   While in Africa on an archaeological dig, Dr. Garnet Williams 
   (William Marshall) finds a wooden vessel in a cave and opens it, 
   unleashing the ancient demon Eshu, the demon god of sexuality (among 
   other nasty things). Meanwhile, in Louisville, Kentucky, Williams' 
   preacher son Emmett (Terry Carter; <B><A HREF="brother_on_the_run_1973.htm">BROTHER
    ON THE RUN</A></B> - 1973), his wife Abby (Carol Speed; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Disco Godfather">DISCO

   new house. It's not long<A HREF="abby_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/abby poster small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="208" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   before the ultra-religious Abby begins experiencing floating objects, 
   moving furniture and other supernatural doings in the new house. She 
   is raped in the shower by Eshu (we see subliminal flashes of Eshu 
   [actually Carol Speed in demon makeup]) and it's not long afterward 
   that Abby is possessed by the demon, slicing her arm up with a 
   butcher knife and freaking out at one of her husband's sermons at 
   church (she throws one church member through a door and drools all 
   over him). Abby begins to physically and mentally deteriorate (she 
   begins talking foul language in a deep voice and punches Emmett in 
   the nuts) and Emmett, at first, fears Abby is on drugs, but her 
   brother, police detective Cass Potter (Austin Stoker; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HorrorHigh1973">HORROR
    HIGH</A></B> - 1973), doesn't believe that is the problem. When Abby 
   rips her clothes off in front of two church members (Emmett says to 
   her, &quot;Whatever possessed you to do a thing like that?&quot;), 
   rapes Emmett in their own bed and kills the church organist, Mrs. 
   Wiggins (Nancy Lee Owens), by giving her a heart attack, Emmett calls 
   his father in Africa and begs him to come home. Dr. Williams, you 
   see, is also a priest and has performed exorcisms in the past. Emmett 
   puts his wife in the hospital, but all the tests find nothing wrong 
   with her, so the doctors recommend she see a psychiatrist (they never 
   get the chance to go). When Dr. Williams arrives in Louisville and 
   attempts to help Abby, she runs out of the house and Emmett steals a 
   car (!) to go looking for her. Abby ends up at a bar, where she kills 
   a series of men while fucking them (she fucks one guy to death in his 
   Cadillac and it fills up with smoke as she begins talking in her 
   possessed voice). Emmett and Cass catch up with her at the bar (she 
   tosses everyone around like a ragdoll) and then Dr. Williams arrives 
   (Abby/Ushu says to him, &quot;Hello motherfucker!&quot;), performs an 
   exorcism (&quot;The light of God binds you!&quot;) and gets Eshu to 
   go back into his wooden vessel. Abby wakes up with no memory of what 
   has happened. Praise the Lord!&nbsp; Warner Bros. successfully sued 
   to stop <B><A HREF="abby_1974b.htm">ABBY</A></B> from being screened 
   shortly after it was released because they believed it followed the 
   plot to their hit from the previous year, <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE

   may have been true (the subliminal flashes, the possession theme, 
   trip to the hospital for tests, etc.), this film contains enough 
   original touches to be an entertaining film on it's own right 
   (American International Pictures, who released this film 
   theatrically, pulled it from release without putting up any fight at 
   all). There have been more blatant rip-offs of <B>THE EXORCIST</B> 
   than this (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondTheDoor1974">BEYOND THE DOOR</A></B> 
   [1974], anyone?), so it seemed a little harsh when this film was 
   pulled and hasn't had a legitimate release in any form for over forty 
   years (It should be noted that when Warner Bros. tried to stop the 
   release of <B>BEYON</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">D</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">,
    the courts decided that Warner Bros. didn't hold the rights to the 
   possession or exorcist themes). Director William Girdler (<B><A HREF="#Asylum of Satan">ASYLUM

   crash while scouting locations in the Philippines in 1978) has 
   fashioned a film, while exploitative (I never liked the term 
   &quot;blaxploitation&quot;), still maintains it's religious 
   convictions and is believably acted by all. William Marshall, fresh 
   off his starring turns in <B><A HREF="blacula_1972.htm">BLACULA</A> </B>(1972)
    and <B><A HREF="scream_blacula_scream_1973.htm">SCREAM BLACULA SCREAM</A></B> 
   (1973), does a marvelous job in the exorcist role, his booming 
   baritone voice shaking the rafters as he attempts to exorcise Eshu 
   out of Abby's body. The exorcism at the bar is a sight to behold, as 
   Marshall spouts religious mumbo-jumbo, while Abby screams out 
   obscenities and acute observations (My favorites being, &quot;Loyalty!
    All crap!&quot;, &quot;Violence! That's your nature! and &quot;Don't 
   play games with me, you simple-minded shit!&quot;) while the bar 
   explodes around everyone. This is good, mindless fun that, 
   unfortunately, got railroaded into obscurity. The gray market DVD by 
   Cinefear Video looks to have been sourced from a beat-up 16mm print, 
   but it is watchable and contains the trailer, a radio spot, stills, 
   lobby cards, pressbook, posters and an informative background article 
   as DVD extras. Definitely worth an investment. Also starring Charles 
   Kissinger (a regular Girdler player), Elliott Moffitt, Nathan Cook, 
   Don Henderson and Bob Holt as the voice of the demon Eshu. American 
   International Pictures wanted to change the name to <B>THE 
   BLACKORCIST </B>before it's release, but saner heads prevailed. A <A HREF="http://www.cinefear.com">Cinefear

    A woman, after watching a phony evangelist named Brother Fogg on TV, 
   coughs up a tumor and throws it away in the garbage. The tumor 
   escapes from the trash and crawls under her son's (Scott Davis) bed 
   where it takes over his mind and grows into a bloodthirsty 
   multi-tentacled monster (who Mom thinks is the Whore of Babylon!). 
   Davis is forced to kill many people to feed the title creature. He 
   even brings the creature to the office of Brother Fogg, hiding it in 
   Fogg's toilet waiting for Fogg to take the last crap of his life. 
   Holy shit, Brother! When the creature gets too big to carry around, 
   it hides in Davis' kitchen cabinets wating for him to feed it the 
   hacked-off body parts of the murdered victims. When Davis falls in 
   love with a beautiful(?) woman the creature takes exception and 
   orders Davis to kill her. Will Davis kill her or destroy the 
   creature? See if you can stay awake to find out. The very bloody 
   effects are the only reason to sit through this catastrophe. 
   Otherwise you will sit through some of the worst stuff badfilms of 
   this type have to offer: Post-synch dubbing, terrible acting, canned 
   music, cheap sets and poor photography. Fortunately, this film shows 
   all of its' bloody effects during the first five minutes when Davis

    At Saint Mary's College in Boston (actually filmed in Belgrade, 
   Serbia). ugly duckling student Kathy (Mijlijana Zirojevic; try saying 
   that three times fast!) is going on her first real date with gym 
   teacher Fred Vernon (Riccardo Acerbi; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein200092">FRANKENSTEIN
    2000</A></B> - 1992), unaware that this date is nothing but a cruel 
   joke perpetrated by her rich, snotty schoolmates. When Kathy 
   discovers the deception (they are listening to Kathy blubber on about 
   how she was looking forward to the date through a walkie talkie), she 
   gets out of Fred's car and runs away, not noticing that a car is 
   quickly approaching. She is hit hard and ends up in a coma, braindead 
   in a hospital room (with a huge open wound on the side of her face), 
   where attending physician, Dr. Robert Anderson (Jared Martin; Fulci's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#NewGladiators1983">THE
    NEW GLADIATORS</A></B> - 1983), tries to make her as comfortable as 
   possible (even though she has many electrodes attached to her head!). 
   The problem is, even though Kathy is in a permanent coma, her brain 
   is very much active (so how can she be &quot;braindead&quot;?) and 
   doesn't want to die. She also wants to get revenge on all those who 
   put her in the condition she is now in. She does this by possessing 
   the body of new student Eva Gordon (Lara Naszinski; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BladeInDark1983">A
    BLADE IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1983), a pretty girl who recently had a 
   nervous breakdown (which makes it easy for Kathy to control her).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eva now has the power of telekinesis and the ability to make people 
   see things that can't possibly be there. Eva's first victim is Fred, 
   who is flexing in front of a mirror in the gym. Fred's reflection 
   exits the mirror and chokes the life out of Fred with his bare hands. 
   Mary (Dusica Zegarac) the school's slow-witted custodian (the mean 
   students call her &quot;retarded&quot;), witnesses the whole thing 
   happening and she shows up at all the future murders. At the same 
   time Fred's doppelg&auml;nger is killing Fred, Dr. Anderson sees a 
   huge spike in Kathy's brain activity and doesn't understand how this 
   could happen in a braindead coma patient. When a doctor examines 
   Fred's dead body in the gym, he tells the Police Inspector (a cameo 
   by Fulci) that Fred died of a heart attack (Hey, what about that 
   bright red bruise around his neck?) and continues to tells the 
   Inspector that he has seen this happen to many people who 
   over-exercise (WTF?!?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next one to die is fellow snotty student Virginia Williams 
   (Kathi Wise). While she is sleeping in bed, she is covered by a swarm 
   of snails(!). She wakes up, but she is unable to move as the snails 
   crawl into her mouth and engulf her body, killing her (Hey, we have 
   seen it done with <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SlugsTheMovie">SLUGS</A></B> 
   (1987), so why not snails? The sequence ends with the shot of a 
   single snail on the shoulder of a poster of a bare-chested Sylvester 
   Stallone from <B><A HREF="rambo_first_blood_2_1985.htm">RAMBO: FIRST 
   BLOOD PART II</A></B> - 1987!). Once again, Dr. Anderson sees a spike 
   in Kathy's brainwaves and starts putting two-and-two together (even 
   though it's a huge leap!). Eva begins to act schizophrenic, because 
   she knows something is happening to her body. Eva has some kind of 
   attack and the school calls in Dr. Anderson to look after her. Rather 
   than giving her proper medical treatment, he becomes her lover! While 
   they are making out in the doctor's car (Doctor, heal thyself!!!), 
   Eva makes sure to point out snobby schoolmate Grace O'Neal (Jennifer 
   Naud) to the doctor, calling her &quot;the bitchiest person in 
   school.&quot; Yes, she is Eva/Kathy's newest victim.&nbsp; She helps 
   Grace look for her favorite earring, telling her she probably dropped 
   it in the school's museum (Eva actually has it). They break into the 
   museum at night and then Eva disappears (literally!), leaving Grace 
   to face her worst fears. A religious fresco comes to life, dropping a 
   bloody severed hand at her feet. The fresco also bleeds, gushing 
   blood all over Grace's face. A statue comes to life and approaches 
   her and when Grace is found the next morning, she is dead with the

    It's quite obvious that Lucio Fulci was on autopilot here, as even 
   the most gory murders lack the visceral impact of his better gore 
   films (including schoolmate Kim [Sophie d'Aulan] finding everyone in 
   school headless in their beds and when her boyfriend Tom [Dragan 
   Ejelogrlic] goes to check up on her, a metal grate slams shut on its 
   own, decapitating him.). Even the film's highlight, death by snails, 
   is rather dreary and lacks the usual Fulci touch. I rank this one 
   lower than Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Manhattan Baby">MANHATTAN
    BABY</A></B> (1982) because the story (screenplay by Fulci &amp; 
   Giorgio Mariuzzo; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HouseByCemetery1981">HOUSE
    BY THE CEMETERY</A></B> - 1981) is highly derivative of countless 
   horror film that came before it, the acting sub-par (Jared Martin, 
   who is badly dubbed, looks extremely bored) and the situations 
   unbelievable (No one even questions why Dr. Anderson is screwing a 
   schoolgirl and who smokes in a hospital room where Kathy is getting 
   pure oxygen?). The ending is yawn-inducing (if very well filmed). 
   offering no surprises to the viewer. Even the song &quot;Head Over 
   Heels&quot; (written by Carlo Maria Cordio [<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> 
   - 1982] &amp; Douglas Meakin [<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#WarriorLostWorld83">WARRIOR
    OF THE LOST WORLD</A></B> - 1983], who also supplies the vocals; 
   it's misspelled &quot;Head Over Meels&quot; in the end credits!) 
   doesn't fit within the confines of the film. I'm a big Fulci fan, but

    This film had a limited theatrical run in the United States by

   and never had a VHS release in the States. The barebones DVD, from

    THE DARK</A><A NAME="AgainstTheDark2009"></A> (2009) -</B> Although 
   this is Steven Seagal's first foray into horror territory, the sad 
   fact is that this film is nothing but a boring, shot-in-Romania DTV 
   effort where Seagal has minimal screen time and he couldn't be 
   bothered with looping his own voice (proving, once again, that Seagal 
   is doing this strictly for the money and can't be bothered with such 
   small things as staying with a film until it's completion, as is the 
   case with the majority of his recent DTV flicks). Instead of battling 
   the usual cast of drug runners, Japanese criminals or smarmy 
   towelheaded terrorists, Seagal and his squad of commandos square-off 
   against a population of plague-infected cannibals, the result of a 
   mutant man-made virus that has spread throughout the planet. Seagal 
   portrays Tao (The Tao Of Steve? Sorry about that.), the leader of a 
   group of &quot;Hunters&quot;, a squad of civilian vigilantes who 
   decide who &quot;lives or dies&quot;. Those who die are the 
   flesh-hungry mutants and those who live are the non-infected 
   survivors who cross their path. Tao and a small group of Hunters 
   enter an abandoned hospital, where Dorothy (Jenna Harrison) and 
   Morgan (Danny Midwinter) lead a group of survivors through the 
   mutant-filled rooms a<A HREF="against_the_dark_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/against the dark dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>nd
    corridors trying not to become infected or mutant chow. The rest of 
   the film is nothing but endless man vs. mutant fight scenes, as Tao 
   and his Hunters slice and dice their way through the hospital (There 
   is very little gunplay here, as Tao and his Hunters prefer the use of 
   swords, knives and other edge weapons, which seems to go against the 
   whole point of this film, which is: The plague is highly 
   communicable, so why splatter and spray mutant blood all over the 
   place?), while Dorothy, Morgan and the rest of the survivors try 
   their damnedest to stay alive until they can be rescued. The 
   introduction of an insane doctor, who stalks the hospital and 
   experiments on the uninfected looking for a cure for his infected 
   young daughter, only adds to the banality, so be prepared for a long, 
   tiring ride (and not the good &quot;I just had sex!&quot; kind).&nbsp;
    As I have stated before, Seagal's screen time is minimal until the 
   final third of the film, so those expecting one of his chop-socky 
   extravaganzas are going to be severely disappointed. The bloated 
   Seagal shows up about every fifteen minutes or so to slice-up a 
   mutant with his trusty sword, while the majority of the film focuses 
   on the exploits of Dorothy, Morgan and the hospital survivors. 
   There's also a sub-plot where Colonel Waters (Keith David; <B><A HREF="they_live_1988.htm">THEY
    LIVE</A></B> - 1988; in a quick booze money cameo) and Lieutenant 
   Cross (Linden Ashby; <B><A HREF="mortal_kombat_1995.htm">MORTAL KOMBAT</A></B> 
   - 1995) decide to &quot;sterilize&quot; the area where Tao and 
   everyone else are fighting the mutants, so it not only becomes a 
   fight for survival, but also a tired &quot;will they make it out in 
   time?&quot; scenario. The direction, by first-timer Richard Crudo 
   (the cinematographer of Seagal's much-better <B><A HREF="pistol_whipped_2008.htm">PISTOL
    WHIPPED</A></B> [2008]), and screenplay, by Michael Klickstein, are 
   both second-rate, as they borrow liberally from <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1968), John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="vampires_1998.htm">VAMPIRES</A></B> 
   (1998) and countless better genre films. There's not much in the way 
   of suspense or action, as characters are introduced and then 
   dispatched (the mad doctor plot ends as quickly as it is introduced 
   when Seagal enters the operating room and unceremoniously blows the 
   doctor away with a shotgun in one of the few scenes of gun violence), 
   the fight scenes consist of the shaky-cam, jackhammer-edited variety 
   that seem to be the standard in today's genre films (thanks <B><A HREF="bourne_identity_2002.htm">BOURNE
    IDENTITY</A></B>!) and the acting non-existent (Seagal, who is also 
   one of the many Producers, seems to let his painted-on hair do most 
   of his emoting, which begs the question: If Seagal looks so bored and 
   non-committal in his recent DTV efforts, why should we continue to 
   watch them?). There's plenty of splashy gore, which includes lots of 
   spilled guts, severed body parts, people being eaten, arterial spray 
   and a decent full body explosion, so if it's blood and gore you are 
   after, you may find some enjoyment here. But, if your idea of a good 
   time runs wider than watching a bunch of gaunt Romanian extras being 
   sliced from stem-to-stern, I would advise that you avoid <B><A HREF="against_the_dark_2009b.htm">AGAINST

    FARM</A><A NAME="AlbinoFarm"></A> (2008) -</B> Being born, bred and 
   still living in the Northern New Jersey hills, I know a thing or two 
   about albinos. Not only did an albino family live on the same street 
   where I spent my entire childhood (My father outright banned me from 
   playing with the albino kids, not because they were albinos, mind 
   you, but because they were black. Even as a child, that didn't sit 
   right with me, so we managed to have a &quot;secret&quot; friendship, 
   a friendship that would get me severe beatings by my father when he 
   caught us together. But that's another story for another time...), 
   there was also this legendary place called Albino Village, a town 
   tucked away deep in the woods that was populated exclusively by 
   albinos. The story was bullshit, of course, but it was a fun way to 
   scare the new neighborhood kids when we went on our frequent camping 
   outings in the woods (Don't get me started on Jackson Whites. Google 
   the term if you have never heard of them.). Now I hope we are all 
   adult enough to realize that albinos (and Jackson Whites) are no 
   different than anyone else (except for the lack of pigment in their 
   skin, eyes and hair), but their appearance is enough to send any 
   uneducated person running for the hills. Which brings us to <B><A HREF="albino_farm_2008b.htm">ALBINO

   see). The adjoining town to the title location is named Shiloh and, 
   wouldn't you know it, four obnoxious twenty-somethings get a flat 
   tire smack-dab in the middle of town while trying to avoid an old 
   dwarf, who is scraping roadkill off the middle of the pavement. The 
   four Gen-X'ers, Stacey (Tammin Sursok), Brian (Nick Richey; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WelcomeToTheJungle">WELCOME
    TO THE JUNGLE</A></B> - 2006), Melody (Alicia Lagano) and Sanjay 
   (Sunkrish Bala), crack redneck jokes and buy a tire from a local 
   named Jeremiah (Duane Whitaker; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TrailerParkOfTerror">TRAILER
    PARK OF TERROR</A></B> - 2008), who warns them to leave the area as 
   soon as possible. Instead of taking his advice (and not wondering why 
   Jeremiah has a pile of perfectly good tires on rims in his backyard), 
   the foursome decide to stay in town and film an amateur documentary 
   on local legends, especially when creepy townie Caleb (Richard 
   Christy) mentions the Albino Farm. They go about interviewing the 
   strange locals (who all are &quot;off&quot; in one way or another), 
   including waitress Shelby (Shelby Janes), who has a deformed hand; a 
   mute little boy (Jackson Curtis), who communicates by writing on his 
   personal chalkboard; and redneck Levi (WWE wrestler Chris Jericho), 
   who agrees to take Brian and Melody to the Albino Farm in his black 
   limousine (driven by two inbred brothers with a thing for heavy metal 
   music) if Melody will flash her tits (which she does reluctantly). 
   While Stacey and Sanjay do research at the local church (where they 
   discover an old lady breast-feeding a deformed baby!), Levi drops off 
   Brian and Melody at the front gate of the Albino Farm with nothing 
   but a flashlight and a claw hammer, leaving the duo to their own 
   devices. This is not going to be a pleasant night for the outsiders, 
   as an army of freaks torture and kill them for daring to set foot on 
   their property.&nbsp; This is standard DTV fodder in <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">THE
    TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B>/<B><A HREF="wrong_turn.htm">WRONG TURN</A></B> 
   vein that eventually deteriorates into a series of bloody torture 
   sessions once the foursome step onto the Albino Farm property. Until 
   then, it's a fairly creepy, if generic, foray into the absurd, as our 
   cast of stereotypical outsiders (although it's interesting in having 
   Indian actor Sunkrish Bala portray one of the stupid outsiders, but 
   his heritage serves no other purpose than that of stunt casting) 
   investigates Shiloh and its deformed citizens. First-time feature 
   film director/producer/screenwriter team of Sean McEwen and Joe 
   Anderson offer plenty of atmosphere, freakish makeups, including a 
   topless &quot;Pig Bitch&quot; (Bianca Barnett), and gory effects 
   (including bone-snapping, a meathook through the mouth and Stacey and 
   Sanjay having their arms sewn to each other), but there is only one 
   albino on view (albeit briefly in the finale), which makes the film's 
   title mostly a cheat (I guess <B>FREAK FARM</B> doesn't have the same 
   allure, but it's more accurate). Another major distraction is the 
   &quot;shakey-cam&quot; photography that is utilized once everyone is 
   on the property. Not only is this camera effect headache-inducing 
   (and it is overused in the majority of horror and action films made 
   today), it's also rather obvious it is used here to mask some of the 
   sub-par freak make-ups. Add to that an ending a blind man could spot 
   a mile away (leaving the film wide-open for the eventual sequel) and 
   what you end up with is a film (lensed in Missouri) that is much less 
   scary than those campfire tales from my childhood. Also starring

   latest space capsule to splash down in the ocean, cave expert Thelma 
   Joyce (Belinda Mayne) is being interviewed on a TV talk show when she 
   passes out just as the capsule hits the water. Her boyfriend Roy 
   (Marc Bodin) comes rushing out and explains that Thelma is psychic 
   and sometimes sees &quot;monsters&quot;. Rather than worry about her 
   episode, Thelma and Roy go bowling (!) with friends. After bowling, 
   Thelma has another vision at the beach, just before a little girl has 
   her face chewed off by a growling blue blob in the sand. Thelma and 
   her friends (which includes future director Michele Soavi [using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Michael Shaw&quot;] as Bert) then go on a cave 
   expedition and, on their way there, they hear on the radio that the 
   space capsule was found empty, the astronauts missing. After 
   rappelling deep into the cave for what seems like half a lifetime, 
   the group settle in for the night (Bert brings his typewriter with 
   him and bangs out pages for his latest novel by candlelight!). The 
   next morning, they all go exploring and the blue rock that Thelma 
   earlier found in a gas station bathroom and put in her backpack 
   begins pulsating. Something looking like a piece of raw liver leaps 
   out of the blue rock and enters the body of Jill, but only Thelma 
   sees it happen and has a difficult time getting anyone to believe 
   her. After what seems like another half a lifetime of rescuing Jill 
   from a ravine (I could have gotten a shave and a haircut and not 
   missed anything), the alien presence bursts out of Jill's eyesocket 
   and begins killing the rest of the group. The first guy is 
   decapitated while hanging upside down on the side of a ravine (the 
   film's best effect) and the rest of the group try to find a way out. 
   After deducing that the caves feed into the ocean, the group then 
   realize that the alien must have hitched a ride on the space capsule 
   and then made it's way into the caves. Bert and girlfriend Maureen 
   (Judy Perrin) are next to die, as the <A HREF="alien_2_1980b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/alien 2 italian vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="116" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>alien
    rips off their faces. Thelma seems to have some psychic link to the 
   alien and can see what the alien sees. And it gets bigger after every 
   kill. And it can possess people. And it can program a VCR (OK, I made 
   that last one up.). Thelma and Roy escapes the caves only to find out 
   that they may be the only humans left alive on Earth. Oops! After a 
   nasty meeting with an alien back at the bowling alley, you better 
   make that one person left alive.&nbsp; God almighty, Jesus on the 
   cross, this is a tough film to sit through. 
   Director/producer/scripter Ciro Ippolito (using his &quot;Sam 
   Cromwell&quot; pseudonym) has made a film where absolutely nothing 
   happens for over 70% of the running time. Filled with scenes of 
   people bowling, driving or spelunking for looooong periods of time 
   (use a calendar instead of a clock to keep track of the time), <B><A HREF="alien_2_1980d.htm">ALIEN
    2</A></B> (also known as <B><A HREF="alien_terror_1980.htm">ALIEN TERROR</A></B>)
    is mostly dead air enlivened by brief scenes of gore. Belinda Mayne (<B><A HREF="white_fire_1984.htm">WHITE
    FIRE</A></B> - 1984) does nothing but look confused, scream and run 
   around a lot (she also gets naked for one brief scene), the same 
   things I was doing when watching this (including the naked part). The 
   gore scenes are nasty, but there is no way I would ever recommend 
   this to anyone unless it were to be used as a method of torture. 
   Watching this should loosen the lips of those al Qaeda bastards! 
   Believe it or not, I watched two versions of this film in one night: 
   An 80 minute version taken from a Japanese subtitled VHS and an 85 
   minute version taken from a Spanish subtitled VHS. The only 
   differences were the opening credits and the Spanish version has five 
   more minutes of exposition. The gore is the same in both. There's 
   supposedly a 102 minute version also floating around. Flush it, now! 
   This has absolutely nothing to do with Ridley Scott's <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B>

    warn Alison not to let &quot;them&quot; get her when she turns 
   nineteen. Cut to the present and it's a few days before her 19th 
   birthday. She seems like a well-adjusted girl who's in love with her 
   disc jockey boyfriend Pete (Lou Brown). Since she was a young girl, 
   she's been an orphan and it seems like she has a good life, but 
   something begins to happen to her that changes her sunny outlook. She 
   begins to have nightmares about a cult of people in robes repeating 
   &quot;Hail Myrne&quot; over and over and the occupants at the 
   boarding house she lives in seem to pay very close attention to her. 
   Perhaps too close.&nbsp; She becomes a virtual prisoner in the

   As Pete digs for more clues as to why Alison is acting so strangely, 
   he comes across the word &quot;Myrne&quot; which is a Celtic demon, 
   that a cult of witches worship. Together with his friend Sally Brown 
   (Lisa Peers), Pete pieces together what is really happening. This is

    THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE</A><A NAME="AllBoysMandy2006"></A> (2006) -</B> 
   This semi-slasher film is best known for being made in 2006 and 
   getting shown around the world, both theatrically and on home video, 
   except for in the United States (filmed in Bastrop, Texas). It 
   finally appeared on <A HREF="all_the_boys_love_mandy_lane_2006.htm">DVD</A> 
   in the States in 2013, thanks to Anchor Bay Entertainment, and I have 
   to be honest and say that this was a major disappointment since many 
   DTV slasher films are a hundred times better than this. The only 
   reason to watch this are early acting roles by Amber Heard (<B><A HREF="drive_angry_2011.htm">DRIVE
    ANGRY</A></B> - 2011; <B><A HREF="machete_kills_2013.htm">MACHETE KILLS</A></B> 
   - 2013) as Mandy and Anson Mount (<B><A HREF="straw_dogs_2011.htm">STRAW
    DOGS</A></B> - 2011; TV's <B><A HREF="hell_on_wheels_tv_series_2011.htm">HELL
    ON WHEELS</A></B> [2011 -2016]) as ranch hand Garth. You will also 
   recognize some other actors in the film, but none of them went on to 
   have the success of Heard and Mount. I can only think of three 
   reasons why this film was never shown in U.S. theaters (even though 
   U.S. posters were printed and prominently displayed): <B>1)</B> There 
   was a problem with music rights (during the end credits, there was a 
   list of songs I don't remember hearing). <B>2)</B> There were some 
   other legal issues that weren't ironed out before opening day. <B>3)</B> 
   The U.S. distributor took one look at the final product and refused 
   to release it because it stunk. I prefer to think it was #3, because, 
   after watching it, I could only express disappointment and shake my 
   head and say &quot;Huh? I waited seven years for this?&quot; Virgin 
   Mandy Lane (Heard) is the most sought-after girl in high school. 
   Every male student wants to pop her cherry. All the guys love her 
   because she is so pretty and most of the high school girls hate her 
   because most of the males only have their eyes on her. Mandy goes to 
   a party with best friend Jake (Luke Grimes) and Jake gets into a 
   fight with Dylan (Adam Popwell) in a pool, who is throwing the 
   shindig at his home, but he and Jake bury the hatchet while sitting 
   on the roof and bonding. They agree to both jump off the roof to the 
   pool below to impress Mandy, but at the end of the count, only Dylan 
   jumps and he hits his head on the edge of the concrete pool and dies. 
   Jake never intended to jump and Mandy becomes <A HREF="all_the_boys_love_mandy_lane_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/all the boys love mandy lane dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="337" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>pissed
    at him. Mandy and a few friends (including Jake, whose friendship 
   with Mandy is strained) go to Red's (Aaron Himelstein) father's ranch 
   for a weekend party and it is very out of the way, since Red's father 
   owns so much land. This is where the trouble begins. They start the 
   party with a game of Truth Or Dare, where Mandy is dared to ask 
   no-nonsense ranch hand Garth (Mount) to come and have a drink with 
   them, but he declines, saying he promised Red's father that he would 
   look after the safety of his son and the guests. While playing the 
   game, Marlin (Melissa Price) picks Truth and says that Jake has a 
   small penis. She feels bad about what she said, so she takes Jake to 
   a barn and gives him a blowjob. When she expects some oral sex in 
   return, Jake just walks away. Marlin is then knocked out and when she 
   wakes up, she is on the ground with a double barrel shotgun barrel in 
   her mouth. We expect the unknown person to pull the trigger, but 
   instead he jams the butt of the shotgun down, so the barrel of the 
   gun travels through Marlin's mouth and protrudes out the back of her 
   neck, killing her (the film's only worthwhile murder, but very hard 
   to see because it is done in rainy darkness). While the killer is 
   dragging Marlin's body away, we see Mandy in the bathroom trimming 
   her pubic hair with scissors because Marlin saw her naked in the 
   girls locker room at school and says hairy bushes are out of style 
   (As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing wrong with hairy bushes. 
   If it was good enough in the 1970's, it good enough now.). This has 
   to be one of the most somber parties I have ever seen on screen. 
   Everyone throws insults at each other and they aren't even worried 
   about Marlin. I've been to wakes that were happier than this party. 
   The electricity goes out, so someone has to go outside to start the 
   generator. Bird (Edwin Hodge) volunteers, but Garth stops him and 
   says this is always a trick Jake plays at parties to get the girls. 
   All he does is turn off the fusebox in the house. While the power is 
   still out, Jake hits on Mandy, but Bird returns just in time (Bird, 
   the only black man in the group, thinks he has a chance with Mandy 
   due to something that happened earlier in the film). A disappointed 
   Jake turns the fusebox back on and then borrows the truck (along with 
   the only gun besides the one Garth has) to go look for Marlin. He 
   finds her sitting by the lake and notices she is dead, but someone 
   knocks him in the water and holds a shotgun waiting him to come up 
   for air. When Jake finally does, he is shotgunned and killed (Jake 
   tries to get completely out of the water, like he could get away!) in 
   one of the most bloodless shotgun deaths committed to film. While the 
   rest of the kids are doing whip-its and drinking Jack at the party, 
   Garth hears the shotgun blast and tells everyone to call it a night 
   (Red tells the others that Garth witnessed his wife being killed and 
   was traumatized during the Gulf War.). Chloe (Whitney Able) is sure 
   she just saw a bloody figure out the window (just after doing a line 
   of cocaine), but when Red checks, he sees nothing. (Chloe and Mandy 
   nearly have a lesbian moment before Bird and Red interrupt them). To 
   make a much too long story short (this is a long 90 minutes), the 
   killer turns out to be Emmett (Michael Welsh), a high school kid who 
   wasn't invited to the party. He stabs Bird to death and then sneaks 
   into the house, strokes Mandy's hair while she is napping on the 
   kitchen table and spells out &quot;WAKE UP&quot; in bloody 
   refrigerator magnets. When everyone tries to leave the house, Garth 
   is shot in the shoulder and everyone retreats back into the house. 
   Red and Chloe leave through the back door to get a car everyone can 
   escape in, but Red is shot dead and Chloe ends up being chased on 
   foot while Emmett follows her in a car. Mandy and Emmett turn out to 
   be responsible for the whole thing (Wait until you hear the 
   reasoning!), as Mandy stabs Chloe dead. It seems that Mandy and 
   Emmett have made a suicide pact, with Mandy overdosing on pills and 
   shooting Emmett to death before the pills kill her. Trouble is, Mandy 
   has no intention of killing herself, so she yells out for Garth to 
   save her. Garth manages to put one bullet into Emmett, but he has 
   trouble reloading his single-shot rifle since his shoulder is 
   injured. Emmett manages to stab Garth a couple of times with a 
   machete, but he turns his attention to Mandy, who has fallen into a 
   pit of diseased, rotting steer. Emmett jumps into the death pit to 
   kill Mandy, but she beats Emmett to death with a tree branch (it's a 
   pretty thick one). It turns out that Garth is not dead, so she puts 
   him in a Jeep and drives away, Garth's future unknown. Mandy is a 
   sociopath with absolutely no human emotions and she gets away with it 
   all. And she has Garth to back-up her story (but I would place bets 
   that he doesn't last long after telling his side of the story to the 
   police).&nbsp; What a bitter disappointment. But, once again, I have 
   been disappointed in watching a film that wasn't released for a long 
   time (Rule of thumb: If it doesn't obtain a U.S. release for years, 
   it is either a Weinstein Brothers film or just plain awful. Sometimes 
   it's both.). It's like expecting steaks and eggs for breakfast and 
   getting soggy plain oatmeal instead, And to add insult to injury, 
   it's not even Quaker's Oatmeal, but some generic store brand. 
   Director Jonathan Levine (<B><A HREF="warm_bodies_2013.htm">WARM BODIES</A></B> 
   - 2013; the pilot episode for the short-lived TV series <B><A HREF="rush_tv_series_2014.htm">RUSH</A></B>

   of <B><A HREF="last_survivors_2014.htm">THE LAST SURVIVORS</A></B> - 
   2014) give us little in the way of suspense, blood or gore. It's like 
   they have never seen a modern day horror film before (or any horror 
   film for that fact). This could very well pass for a TV movie if some 
   drug use and foul language were edited out because the violence is 
   almost non-existent, as hardly any of it is shown in a way that would 
   have TV editors worried. There is absolutely no sense of fun, as 
   there is zero chemistry between the cast members (Heard and Mount 
   come the closest, but it is all an act by Mandy). There's a reason it 
   took seven years to get a U.S. disc release: It stinks. This is one 
   of the lamest slasher films I have seen in some time and using 
   suicide as an excuse to kill your fellow classmates is not only 
   inexcusable (even in 2006), it is irresponsible. Suicide is not a 
   valid or tasteful plot device, something that <B><A HREF="all_the_boys_love_mandy_lane_2006b.htm">ALL
    THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE</A></B> fails to recognize and it is just 
   in extremely poor taste. My wish is virgin Mandy to die, go to Hell 
   and then get screwed non-stop by an infinite amount of Hell's 
   denizens lined up for their turn. Amber Heard, who also starred in <B><A HREF="ward_2010.htm">THE
    WARD</A></B> (2010), John Carpenter's worst film ever, has 
   absolutely no charisma here and one wonders why all the boys (and one 
   girl) would want to get into her panties. The only actor that 
   registers is Anson Mount (who reminds me of <B><A HREF="person_of_interest_tv_series_2011.htm">PERSON
    OF INTEREST</A></B>'s Jim Caviezel; they could pass for brothers), 
   who shows more than a modicum of talent. To put this politely as 
   possible, you would have to be fucking nuts to watch this piece of 
   shit. Screenwriter Jacob Forman gave himself an uncredited cameo as a 
   fireworks salesman and producer Chad Freehan did the same thing as a 
   high school football coach. Also starring Peyton Hayslip, Brooke 
   Bloom, Robert Earl Keen and Amber Bartlett. An <A HREF="http://anchorbayentertainment.com">Anchor

    HUMAN</A><A NAME="AlmostHuman2013"></A> (2013) -</B> As soon as I 
   started watching this low-budget, inventive modern-day horror film, I 
   was instantly transported back to the 80's. I know a lot of modern 
   horror films try to emulate that period (releasing a film on VHS does 
   not mean that nostalgia is going to come rushing over me like a tidal 
   wave), but this one nails it right in the head. The film is full of 
   little tributes to other horror and science fiction films from the 
   80's and earlier, but it is definitely an original film in its own 
   right. The film opens with the on-screen scrawl: <B>&quot;The 
   following is based on events that took place in Patten, Maine.&quot;</B> 
   (but the film was shot in Rhode Island, one of the few horror <A HREF="almost_human_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/almost human 2013 dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="287" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>film
    that I can remember being filmed entirely in that State). On Friday, 
   October The 13th, 1987, Seth Hampton (Graham Skipper; <B><A HREF="tales_of_halloween_2015.htm">TALES
    OF HALLOWEEN</A></B> - 2015) is driving like a maniac down a dark 
   road looking like he is trying to outrun someone or something. He 
   makes it to friend Mark Fisher's (Josh Ethier; also this film's 
   Editor and Co-Producer) home and is in a panic, staring through the 
   Venetian blinds to see if whatever he is scared of has arrived. Seth 
   tells Mike that &quot;something is fucking following me!&quot; and 
   goes on to explain that he was driving with their friend Rob when a 
   blue light exploded in front of them and he nearly drove the car into 
   a tree. Seth goes on to explain that there was an ear-piecing noise 
   that made their ears bleed. Mike wants Seth to drive him to where 
   this happened, but Seth refuses, yelling that Rob is gone because 
   &quot;a beam of light sucked him into the fucking sky!&quot; Seth 
   warns Mark not to go there, but before Mark can make a decision, the 
   blue light appears, engulfs the house and the electricity goes out, 
   followed by the ear-piercing noise. Mark walks out of the house like 
   he is in a zombiefied state, and before Seth and Mark's girlfriend 
   Jen (Vanessa Leigh; <B><A HREF="joy_and_the_apocalypse_2011.htm">JOY 
   AND THE APOCALYPSE</A></B> - 2011) can do anything, they watch Mark 
   being sucked into the sky by a beam of light. As the opening credits 
   play (The appearance of the film's title uses the same font and 
   movement as John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE THING</A></B> 
   [1982] and there are other instances in this film that also remind 
   you of Carpenter's film, as well as the <A HREF="thing_1982_almost_human_2013_poster_comparison.htm">poster
    and DVD art</A>.), we see a bunch of TV reporters (one of them 
   portrayed by the director) telling their audience that the whole 
   county lost electricity last night and the power companies have no 
   idea how it happened. As the days pass, the reporters also go on to 
   say that Mark and Rob (whom we never meet, or at least think we never 
   will, but you'll have to discover that for yourself if you are 
   patient) are officially declared missing and the county sheriff comes 
   on TV to declare that the lights everyone saw and the two men's 
   disappearances have nothing to do with &quot;extraterrestrials&quot; 
   (the film's shooting title). As the opening credits continue rolling, 
   the reporters say that authorities believe that Seth Hampton had 
   something to do with their disappearance and he was taken into 
   custody (we then see police interrogation footage of Seth proclaiming 
   his innocence), but the police had to release him for lack of 
   evidence. Two years pass and Seth wakes up from a nightmare with a 
   bloody nose. It seems he started getting bloody noses in the past 
   week, so he makes an appointment with a doctor and calls his job to 
   tell his boss he will be late coming in (while he is doing this, he 
   watches as a reporter on TV says that people saw a bright blue light 
   last night and wonder if it is related to the incident two years 
   earlier). Jen has moved on and is now living with nice guy Clyde 
   (Anthony Amaral III) in her same old house (she was just sleeping 
   over at Mark's house on the night he disappeared). She also watches 
   the news report about the lights and seems genuinely scared (this 
   comes right after her boss tells her he is cutting her hours at the 
   diner she works at due to &quot;slow business&quot;). We then see two 
   hunters in the woods, where they spot a naked human body shivering on 
   the cold Winter ground. It turns out to be Mark (shades of Harry 
   Bromley Davenport's <B><A HREF="xtro_1983.htm">XTRO</A></B> [1983]), 
   but it is apparent from his appearance and actions that he is a 
   changed man (if he is a man at all). He lets out an ear-piercing yell 
   which brings the two hunters to their knees and starts choking one of 
   them, while the other hunter loads his rifle and fires, but he hits 
   his friend in the head instead, splattering blood all over Mark's 
   face. Mark then snaps the other hunter's neck, steals his clothes and 
   does something to his body (off-screen) that we are not privy 
   to...yet. Seth goes to visit Jen at the diner (the first time he has 
   talked to her since Mark disappeared) and says he thinks the lights 
   returning last night have something to do with Mark, but she tells 
   him Mark is dead and for Seth to go see a psychiatrist (Jen remembers 
   very little about what happened two years earlier). Meanwhile, Mark 
   walks to the nearest gas station and asks the guy behind the counter 
   where he is because he has to get to Patten, The counter guy (who is 
   not pleased that Mark has walked into his station carrying a rifle) 
   tells Mark that Patten is 100 miles away and then tells him to get 
   the hell out of his station. Mark walks outside, where he stabs a guy 
   in the neck with a knife over and over so he can steal his truck. The 
   counter guy comes outside holding a shotgun, telling Mark not to 
   move, but Mark throws the knife at the guy super-quick and hits his 
   mark (no pun intended), finishing off the counter guy by blowing off 
   his head with his own shotgun. Mark then throws the body of the 
   stabbed driver in the back of the truck (seems he has no use for 
   human bodies without heads) and drives to Patten. Seth arrives at the 
   hardware store where he works and apologizes to his not-too-pleased 
   boss Clancy (Chuck Doherty) for being an hour late (Clancy is worried 
   that Seth is reverting back to the problems that he had two years 
   earlier). Mark arrives at his old house, which has been sold to a 
   married couple (In one of the film's little effective touches, 
   there's a round patch of ground in the front yard when Mark was 
   abducted where grass still refuses to grow.). He cuts the phone line 
   and kills the husband outside (who is chopping and chainsawing wood) 
   with a shotgun blast to his chest and an axe to his head (nothing is 
   left to the imagination) and then grabs the chainsaw and cuts open 
   the front door of the house (shades of <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">THE
    TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE</A></B> [1974]), asking the wife &quot;What 
   are you doing in my house?!?&quot; and chasing her outside with the 
   chainsaw. She gets into her car, but before she can drive away 
   (unlike other horror film tropes, the car starts up as soon as she 
   turns the key), he uses the chainsaw to break the driver side window, 
   drags her out of the car and slits her throat with a knife (we are 
   led to believe she is going to suffer a horrible chainsaw death, but 
   this film keeps throwing sharp rights when you thing you are going to 
   get a left). Seth's co-worker Jimmy (John Palmer) tells him he just 
   saw a report on TV about the murders at the gas station and Seth 
   faints, his nose bleeding again. Clancy makes him take the rest of 
   the day off and tells him not to come back until he feels better. We 
   then find out what Mark does with the dead bodies: A fleshy tube 
   comes shooting out of Mark's mouth and attaches itself to the 
   corpses' mouths and something travels down the tube and enters the 
   dead bodies (with a sickly white goo spurting out of their mouths), 
   turning them into pods and, after a while, an exact copy of of those 
   people emerges from the pods, but they are no longer human (both the 
   pods and the loud-pitched screams are tributes to both the <A HREF="invasion_of_the_body_snatchers_1956.htm">1956</A> 
   and <A HREF="invasion_of_the_body_snatchers_1978.htm">1978</A> 
   versions of <B>INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</B>). Jen then sees the 
   murders at the gas station on TV and starts to feel strange, so she 
   gets a co-worker to drive her home. Before she gets there, Mark shows 
   up at her house and meets Clyde. He recognized Mark and starts 
   beating him with a baseball bat when he enters the house uninvited 
   while telling Mark, &quot;Do you think you can walk back into her 
   life and break into my fucking house?&quot;. Mark lets out the 
   ear-piercing scream and snaps Clyde's neck, infecting his body with 
   the alien seed and putting it with the rest of the bodies in a barn 
   next to Jen's house. Seth gets back to his house and listens to a 
   message on his answering machine from his doctor, who wants him to 
   call first thing in the morning. At the same time, Mark hears Jen 
   call her home and her answering machine picks up, where she tells 
   Clyde that she is not feeling too well and her co-worker is driving 
   her home. Mark stays at the house and waits for her to<A HREF="almost_human_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/almost human 2013 vod ad8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   come home and he calls Seth, saying something that makes him hurry 
   over to Jen's house. When Jen gets home, she notices the strange 
   truck parked in her front yard, so she enters her home cautiously. 
   She then meets Mark and is overcome with emotions, but she wonders 
   what has happened to Clyde when Mark asks her if she still loves him. 
   Mark then tells her that he is going to give her what she always 
   wanted: A family. But it is not the type of family she was expecting 
   before Mark was abducted. Mark tells her, &quot;I'm different now. I 
   want you to join me, to be like me, so we can always be 
   together.&quot; If you want to find out what happens next and, 
   believe me, you will, you'll have to rent or buy the film (I picked 
   up a brand new copy on DVD from <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</A> 
   for less than $6.00. It was money well spent.). Needless to say, it's 
   a bloody, gory, gooey experience, filled with inventive murders, a 
   race of human-looking aliens bursting out of the pods and Seth trying 
   to save Jen. If you don't want to miss one of the most insane, 
   bat-shit crazy horror films of the last decade (What Mark does to Jen 
   is particularly disturbing, but what Seth does to her is even 
   worse.), filled with dismembered body parts, flashbacks on what 
   happened to Mark when he was abducted, non-titillating nudity and 
   genuine suspense that will have you at the edge of your seat, throw 
   down a few bucks and get this film. It packs a lot into its short 
   79-minute running time (the end credits last eight minutes to pad out 
   the film to feature length, but make sure you watch them because 
   there is a stinger after the credits end which answers a nagging 
   question I had since the beginning of the film). This is an excellent 
   old-fashioned gore film with an actual plot, the kind they don't make 
   any more. Sure, there are some gaping plot holes (What did the doctor 
   want to talk to Seth about? By the sound of the doctor's tone, it 
   didn't sound good.), but you'll be having too good of a time to 
   really care about them. Freshman director/screenwriter/co-producer/cinematographer

   themselves and their captive to a secluded compound owned by Wyatt 
   (Adam Kaufman), a neurotic survivalist who was also abducted by 
   aliens. The hillbilly trio look at this as an opportunity to get 
   payback, since fifteen years earlier, the aliens killed Cody's 
   brother Timmy, but Wyatt believes believes that more aliens will come 
   to retrieve their comrade (Wyatt performs some homemade surgery 
   removing an organic tracking device, called a &quot;Clicker&quot;, 
   from the alien's body). When the alien tries to take over the mind of 
   Wyatt's girlf<A HREF="altered_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/altered dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>riend
    Hope (Catherine Mangan), Wyatt sets up a safe perimeter around the 
   alien (who is chained and duct-taped to a table in Wyatt's garage) 
   after Hope nearly kills herself with a box cutter and the alien bites 
   Cody on the arm. The alien begins fucking with everyone's minds, as 
   violent ex-con Cody becomes infected by an alien organism and tries 
   to burn the alien with an acetylene torch before being knocked-out 
   and locked in a closet, where his flesh slowly rots from his bones. 
   Wyatt seems to know more about the alien and the infection than he's 
   letting on (Like why he's immune to the infection) and when the alien 
   breaks free, it becomes clear that all this was an alien plan to 
   locate Wyatt, who years before performed some surgery on himself, 
   removing a Clicker from his intestines so the aliens couldn't keep 
   track of him. The sudden appearance of nosy Sheriff Henderson (James 
   Gammon) throws a monkey wrench into the proceedings, as the alien 
   attacks Otis (it holds a still-living Otis' intestines in it's hand 
   in some weird Mexican standoff, in one of the film's standout scenes) 
   and the Sheriff is accidentally shot dead. Wyatt and Hope hop in the 
   van to take a mortally wounded Otis to the hospital, but Duke pulls a 
   fast one and loads an empty cage in the back of the van (Wyatt thinks 
   the alien is in the cage). When Otis dies in the van, Wyatt discovers 
   the deception and heads back to the compound on foot (narrowly 
   escaping an army of aliens), only to discover Duke an inch away from 
   death (he's been nail-gunned to a wall with his intestines exposed; a 
   Clicker visible amongst the entrails) and a rotting Cody possessed by 
   the alien. Hope shows up and saves Wyatt's hide and, luckily, Wyatt 
   has a master plan when the aliens show up en masse to take him 
   away.&nbsp; This is a fascinating look of humans being the captors 
   instead of the captives, but how our emotions will always get in the 
   way for us to be as unfeeling and clinical as the aliens. Director 
   Eduardo Sanchez (co-director of <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE

   screenwriter Jamie Nash (a frequent Sanchez collaborator) have 
   fashioned a wonderfully tense horror film that not only plays with 
   our perceptions of life and death, but also with what it means to be 
   human. This is a cerebral horror film that doesn't skimp on the red 
   stuff to get it's point across. There are scenes here that will 
   actually make you cringe, such as when the alien takes over Cody's 
   rapidly deteriorating body and attacks Wyatt; Cody's brittle bones 
   snapping like twigs and protruding out of his decaying skin as he 
   swings at Wyatt. The alien design is amazingly frightening in it's 
   simplicity, a combination of practical and CGI effects (CGI is mainly 
   employed for the alien army sequences), yet not once did I think that 
   this was a person (actually a stuntwoman named Misty Rojas) in an 
   alien suit. The acting is uniformly excellent for such a low-budget 
   effort and most of the time everyone here acts like normal people 
   surrounded in a situation that is anything but normal. The deleted 
   scenes on the DVD add extra depth to the characters and, in my 
   opinion, should not have been edited out of the film. <B><A HREF="altered_2006b.htm">ALTERED</A></B> 
   (a title that has many meanings here) is a thoroughly engrossing take 
   on the alien abduction subgenre. It's a film that will leave you 
   thinking long after the film is over. How many films, especially 
   horror films, can make that claim? A <A HREF="http://www.universalstudioshomeentertainment.com">Universal

   films. While <B><A HREF="american_gothic_1988.htm">AMERICAN GOTHIC</A></B> 
   fails to achieve the sense of tragedy of those two films (both have 
   killer shock endings), it is still miles better than most of the 80's 
   schlock that flooded the market and actually makes some rather sharp, 
   insightful observations about what constitutes a &quot;family&quot;. 
   The film opens with Cynthia (Sarah Torgov) being released from a 
   mental institution after recovering from a nervous breakdown over the 
   tragic accidental death of her child. Her husband Jeff (Mark 
   Ericksen) thinks it will be a good idea to take her on a trip to the 
   islands off the coast of Seattle, Washington, the same trip they took 
   during their honeymoon (they want to try and have another child), 
   only this time they are bringing some friends along with them to 
   cheer-up Cynthia and get her mind off the tragedy. The friends, Rob 
   (Mark Lindsay Chapman; <B><A HREF="annihilator_1986c.htm">THE ANNIHILATOR</A></B> 
   - 1986), Terri (Caroline Barclay),<A HREF="american_gothic_1987c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/american gothic vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="322" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Paul (Stephen Shellen) and Lynn (Fiona Hutchinson), join Cynthia and 
   Jeff on a sea plane and end up taking a trip to the darker side of 
   Hell. The plane develops engine trouble, so pilot Jeff is forced to 
   land the plane next to some uncharted island, where they pitch tents 
   and camp out for the night. The next morning, Terri decides to do 
   some scuba diving (She asks Rob to go with her, but he declines, 
   saying, &quot;I only dive for muff, sweetheart!&quot;) but she slips 
   on some rocks, hits her head and ends up floating face-down in the 
   ocean. When Cynthia sees this happening, she instantly flashes-back 
   to her baby tragedy, where her baby daughter accidentally drowned in 
   the bathtub, thanks to Cynthia being too occupied by the phone 
   ringing and dinner boiling over on the stove. Cynthia freezes in her 
   tracks and Jeff is forced to save Terri. Jeff can't fix the plane, so 
   Paul stays behind to watch the plane while everyone else searches the 
   island. They come upon a house built near the edge of a cliff and 
   when no one answers the door, they let themselves in and find what 
   can best be described by Rob as he says, &quot;Geesh, it's like we 
   walked into the 1920's!&quot; While everyone else is dancing the 
   Charleston as 78rpm records play on a Gramophone, Cynthia explores 
   the house and finds a nursery filled with toys, furniture and photos 
   from the 20's. Everyone's fun is cut short by the appearance of Ma 
   (Yvonne De Carlo; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nocturna">NOCTURNA</A></B> 
   - 1979) and Pa (Rod Steiger; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Wolf Lake 1978">WOLF
    LAKE</A></B> - 1978), the owners of the house. Ma seems outgoing and 
   friendly, while Pa seems strict and uber-religious. The group has 
   dinner with Ma and Pa, who both seem stuck in the 20's (When Rob 
   mentions that man has landed on the moon, Ma tells him to &quot;quit 
   telling stories.&quot;) and are then invited to spend the night, 
   where they meet Ma and Pa's &quot;children&quot;: 50 year-old Fanny 
   (Janet Wright), who is obviously retarded and thinks she's about to 
   turn twelve (!), and Woody (Michael J. Pollard; <B><A HREF="night_visitor_1989.htm">NIGHT
    VISITOR</A></B> - 1989), who is equally retarded (it's kind of hard 
   to tell with Pollard the actor, though!). Fanny and Woody kill Rob by 
   pushing him over a cliff while he is taking a scary ride on a 
   homemade swing set and when Cynthia finds his mangled body, it sets 
   in motion a series of events where Cynthia learns what family is 
   really all about, even if the lesson comes from a family of 
   incestuous throwbacks, which also includes another child named Teddy 
   (William Hootkins; <B><A HREF="hardware_1990.htm">HARDWARE</A></B> - 
   1990) and the mummified corpse of Fanny's baby. Meanwhile, Cynthia's 
   friends start dropping like flies.&nbsp; Director John Hough, who 
   also gave us <B><A HREF="sudden_terror_1970.htm">SUDDEN TERROR</A></B> 
   (1970) and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Incubus1981">THE INCUBUS</A></B> 
   (1981), has fashioned a film that is, for all its outrageous 
   preposterous situations (How have Ma, Pa and their children have 
   remained hidden for so long?), still a damn fine piece filmmaking 
   that says a lot about what constitutes a family, no matter how 
   fucked-up they are (and, really, do you know a family that isn't?). 
   While the screenplay, by Burt Wetanson and Michael Vines, may fall 
   back on some genre conventions (the killing of Cynthia's husband and 
   friends in various bloody ways, such as axe-to-the-head, a hanging 
   and an eye impalement), there are scenes here that will make the hair 
   on the back of your neck stand on end, such as Cynthia giving-in to 
   her neurosis and the reveal of Fanny's &quot;big dollies&quot; in the 
   cellar, where Ma gives a chilling description of each 
   &quot;dolly's&quot; history. There's also an unpleasant scene where 
   Teddy rapes Lynn's corpse (thankfully, most of it is offscreen, but 
   we get the gist) and the macabre scene where Cynthia and Fanny argue 
   over possession of the mummified baby's corpse (ripping its head off 
   in the process!), which sets off an obviously psychotic Cynthia to 
   murder her new family (Pa, after seeing what Cynthia has done, 
   renounces God just as Cynthia shotguns him in the back) and claim the 
   island as her own. <B><A HREF="american_gothic_1987d.htm">AMERICAN GOTHIC</A></B>

   Nickson-Soul as a painter of demonic portraits and Richard Roundtree

   house when he was a teen. Keye has no memories of his father since he 
   saw him kill Keye's mother when they were visiting him at a mental 
   hospital years before, that event causing his mind to block out the

   (2007) -</B> A series of three seemingly unrelated stories, all 
   concerning three female students of the same grammar school, make up 
   this interesting horror film. The first story is about Shelby (Laura 
   Breckenridge), who is traveling down the highway late one night in a 
   car driven by her boyfriend Rob (Tad Hilgenbrink; <B><A HREF="lost_boys_the_tribe_2008.htm">LOST
    BOYS: THE TRIBE</A></B> - 2008). Rob becomes a participant in a 
   &quot;convoy&quot;, where his car, an eighteen-wheeler and an SUV 
   travel at the same rate of speed behind each other, with the 
   eighteen-wheeler leading the way. When the truck pulls into a gas 
   station for fuel, so does Rob and the SUV. Rob meets the talkative 
   driver of the SUV while Shelby notices a scared-looking woman in the 
   cab of the eighteen-wheeler. The truck driver tells everyone that the 
   highway ahead is bumper-to-bumper traffic, so everyone should follow 
   him because he knows an alternate route (He also says that he is 
   traveling alone, which immediately raises suspicions in Shelby, but 
   Rob ignores her warning and follows him anyway). They're all in the 
   middle of nowhere when a woman jumps out the back of the truck and 
   onto the windshield of Rob's car. This all leads to the real killer 
   being unmasked, Shelby being kidnapped and Rob being told, &quot;You 
   picked the wrong convoy, buddy!&quot; by the killer before fading to 
   black. The second tale is about Tabitha (Kat<A HREF="amusement_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/amusement dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>heryn

   babysit young nephews Danny and Max (real-life brothers Brennan &amp; 
   Preston Bailey). She is surprised to find that the previous 
   babysitter has already left, leaving the two young boys alone, but 
   noises in the attic and a late night visit from the babysitter's 
   boyfriend lead Tabitha to believe that something is very, very wrong 
   in this house. Maybe it's the creepy life-size clown doll that seems 
   to have a life of it's own, maybe it's the TV that turns itself off 
   and on or maybe it's the raging thunderstorm outside, but Tabitha is 
   more than a little on-edge. When her Aunt calls on the phone and 
   tells Tabitha that they don't own a life-size clown doll, Tabitha 
   must save her nephews and herself from a cackling clown serial killer 
   who is holding some very sharp weapons. Just when it looks like the 
   clown is going to kill Tabitha, we cut to Tabitha being questioned in 
   an interrogation room, where she flashes-back to her grade school 
   days when she was best friends with Shelby, Lisa and a strange young 
   boy who is carrying around a splayed-live rat diorama. This triggers 
   the last story, where a fully-grown Lisa (Jessica Lucas; <B><A HREF="cloverfield_2007.htm">CLOVERFIELD</A></B>

   picking-up strange men. After watching her roommate picking up a 
   complete stranger, Lisa returns home and her roommate never shows up 
   or leaves a phone message. She goes to the creepy old hotel where her 
   roommate said the stranger was staying, only to be turned away at the 
   door after being told by the creepy hotel proprietor &quot;all of our 
   beds are full tonight&quot;. Lisa and her boyfriend Dan (Reid Scott), 
   a health inspector, stakeout the hotel and notice that no one seems 
   to be coming in or going out of it. Dan enters the hotel under the 
   ruse of a health inspection, where the creepy proprietor shows Dan an 
   antique Victrola that kills Dan by shooting a sharp projectile into 
   his head. Lisa grows worried when Dan doesn't come out, so she sneaks 
   into the hotel and discovers that every bed is indeed full: The 
   bodies of every previous occupant are sewn into the sheets and 
   mattresses in a sight that can only be described as grotesque. In the 
   finale, we find Shelby, Tabitha and Lisa have all been deposited in 
   the same abandoned insane asylum, their captor being the strange 
   little boy from their past, who has grown into an insane killer (and, 
   apparently, a master of disguise) known only as &quot;The Laugh&quot; 
   (Keir O'Donnell). It seems he now wants to play and this abandoned 
   building has become his personal diorama.&nbsp; This is not your 
   normal anthology film, as director John Simpson (who also made the 
   highly unusual and affecting thriller <B><A HREF="freeze_frame_2004.htm">FREEZE
    FRAME</A></B> in 2004) and screenwriter Jake Wade Wall (<B><A HREF="when_a_stranger_calls_2006.htm">WHEN
    A STRANGER CALLS</A></B> - 2006) have turned in an above average 
   horror film that contains weird visuals (take notice of all the 
   circular-shaped objects in this film), some inventive camera work and 
   good acting. While the violence isn't overly gory, when it is 
   displayed it is effective (especially the reveal of the beds in the 
   creepy hotel and the fates of Shelby and Lisa, who are both splayed-open
    and still alive, only to trick the viewer into believing they are 
   seeing something that's not really there). If there's a weak point to 
   this film, it's the final fifteen minutes, where the insane killer 
   proves to be virtually indestructible. How come all mental patients 
   in horror films seem to have this power? Maybe I should spend some 
   time in one. All-in-all, though, <B><A HREF="amusement_2007b.htm">AMUSEMENT</A></B>

   late-1981 (as <B><A HREF="grim_reaper_1980.htm">THE GRIM REAPER</A></B>)

    The film opens with a young German couple (and their dog) walking 
   through the narrow cobblestone<A HREF="anthropophagus_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/anthropophagus the grim reaper dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   sidewalks of a Greek village (filmed in Athens, Greece). They end up 
   at the beach, where the lovely young woman strips off her clothes to 
   reveal a skimpy bikini and the guy puts on headphones and listens to 
   disco music. The girl goes into the ocean and she notices an unmanned 
   row boat drifting in the distance. She swims to it and sees something 
   bloody inside, when someone pulls her underwater and drags her to her 
   death (her boyfriend can't hear her screams because of the 
   headphones). We then watch as someone plants a meatcleaver into the 
   boyfriend's skull (the dog runs away).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We are then introduced to the pregnant Maggie (Serena Grandi), who 
   is riding in a cable car in Greece with her husband Arnold (Bob

   - 1979) overhears that the group are going to take a boat to a Greek 
   island, she asks if she can come along for the ride because she was 
   hired to chaperone the 15 year-old daughter of a French couple for 
   the Summer and they live on that island. The group agrees and they 
   all meet Andy (Saverio Vallone), the pilot of the boat and good 
   friend of the group. Once on the boat, Carol reads Maggie's future by 
   using Tarot cards, but refuses to tell Maggie what they mean (Carol 
   tells Julie that Maggie has no future). When they get to the island, 
   Maggie sprains her ankle getting off the boat and decides to stay on 
   the boat with a deckhand, while the others walk to the village. Julie 
   finds it strange that the French couple didn't come to greet her, but 
   when they get to the village they find out why: the village is deserted.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, back on the boat, Maggie discovers the deckhand's severed 
   head in a water bucket and she herself falls victim to the unknown 
   killer, as we see him dragging her body away. Julie discovers a 
   mutilated corpse in the village (&quot;It looks all chewed up!&quot;),
    so Arnold and everyone else run to the boat to make sure Maggie is 
   OK, but they find someone has pulled up anchor and the boat is slowly 
   drifting off to sea. Everyone is now trapped on the island and must 
   make the best of a bad situation. Julie discovers that her 15 
   year-old charge, Rita (Margaret Donnelly) is hiding in a barrel of 
   wine. Rita jumps up and stabs Daniel with a knife (it is only a flesh 
   wound) and all she can say is, &quot;Blood! The smell of blood!&quot; 
   Carol catches Daniel putting the moves on Julie, becomes jealous and 
   runs away. Julie chases after her and Carol locks her in a cemetery. 
   Daniel, who is keeping a close watch on Rita, hears a noise 
   downstairs and goes to investigate (Rita yells out, &quot;He's here. 
   I can smell him!&quot;). Rita screams and it is at this time that we 
   get a good look at the killer: A hulk of a man named Nikos Karamanlis 
   (George Eastman; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B> 
   - 1983) who kills Daniel by taking a huge bite out of his neck. Nikos 
   has become The &quot;Anthropophagus Man&quot;, or a person who loves 
   the taste of human flesh. It seems he became that way when his boat 
   capsized and he and his family were trapped on a rubber raft with no 
   rescue in sight. The only way he could survive was to eat his young 
   son and wife!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Julie finds a diary in the home of the Karamanlis', a family that 
   have lived on the island for over a hundred years. It explains how 
   Nikos became a flesh eater and why Ruth Karamanlis (Rubina Rey) has 
   just hanged herself in front of the group. Andy and Arnold search the 
   island hoping to find a way to get to the drifting boat. They split 
   up (always a good idea in a horror film) and Arnold finds one of 
   Maggie's shoes on a path that leads to an underground catacomb. 
   Arnold finds Maggie alive, but she won't stay that way for long, as 
   Nikos traps them in the catacomb, stabs Arnold in the neck and, in 
   the film's most notorious scene (which is not in the R-Rated 
   version), he rips the baby out of Maggie's womb and eats it!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Now it is Julie and a semi-comatose Rita's turn to fight off the 
   flesh-hungry monster. Who will survive? It also answers this 
   question: What will the Anthropophagus Man eat when there are no more 
   humans on the island? Why, he will eat his own intestines (as we 
   watch as Andy plants a <A HREF="grim_reaper_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/grim reaper 1981 ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>pickaxe

    The fact of the matter is that this film is rather boring, even in 
   its uncut form. Director Joe D'Amato was never a man to make a really 
   understandable horror film, his best one being the exercise in bad 
   taste <B><A HREF="buried_alive_1979b.htm">BURIED ALIVE</A></B> (a.k.a <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BeyondTheDarkness79">BEYOND
    THE DARKNESS</A></B> - 1979) a gore-filled tale of necrophilia, as 
   well as <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmanuelleCannibal77">TRAP 
   THEM AND KILL THEM</A></B> (1977), an Italian cannibal film. D'Amato 
   became known as Italy's purveyor of sleaze because he always mixed 
   sex with horror (but, strangely, not in this film) and when Italian 
   horror movies no longer became popular, he made over 150 porn films 
   before his death in 1999. The screenplay, by D'Amato (using his real 
   name, Aristide Massaccesi) and Eastman (using his real name, Luigi 
   Montefiori) is too leisurely paced for its own good and the gore 
   doesn't begin to flow until the finale, as we see Nikos pulling 
   Rita's head through a hole in the roof, the skin on her face peeling 
   away as it comes out of the small hole. Or the baby eating scene (it 
   was actually a skinned rabbit!), which doesn't have the power it once 
   did in the early-'80s. Rumor has it that Tisa Farrow (the sister of 
   Mia Farrow) was so disgusted with this film that she retired from 
   acting. When viewed today, the film is very boring and offers few 
   surprises or jolts. What was considered gory nearly 40 years ago 
   seems old hat today. D'Amato made a semi-sequel, <B><A HREF="anthropophagus 2.htm">ANTHROPOPHAGUS

   rightly so, because this is a career low for both of them (Porno 
   flicks are a step-up from this). The practical effects are truly 
   terrible&nbsp; (Again, the Hunter looks like someone cut-up a few of

   stunt man's body) and the computer effects are even worse, leaving 
   AVH a boring and nearly blood-free mess (just a couple of impalements 
   and blood-covered shirts). The &quot;surprise&quot; finale, where the 
   Hunter pulls off his mask, revealing himself to be human, is one of 
   the most idiotic cop-out endings of all time. It really amazes me how 
   the people at The Asylum can continue getting away with ripping-off 
   titles of major motion pictures (even copying their ad campaigns) and 
   still not get their asses sued off. Maybe it's because these little 
   pieces of boredom are beyond contempt. At least when Roger Corman did 
   it, they were fun and sexy. When The Asylum does it, they are 
   worthless and about as sexy as watching grandma undress. Save your

   the original <A HREF="blob_1958.htm">1958</A> film), where paintball 
   warriors discover a seemingly deserted house in the woods, only to 
   find out that it is occupied by the mad Dr. Boskovic (Chuck McMahon), 
   who is experimenting with a bacterium of his own design. The mad 
   doctor kidnaps Beth (Alison Whitney), one of the paintballers, strips 
   her naked and decontaminates her, but Beth breaks free, overpowers 
   the doctor and takes him captive and is joined by friends Jiggs 
   (Benjamin Kanes) and Brook (Miya Sagara), as the looney doctor 
   explains the predicament they are all in. Dr. Boskovic's bacterium 
   was developed as a germ warfare weapon, but the doctor and his 
   partner (who we saw burned to death by flame-thrower by government 
   goons in the film's opening minutes) stole it away from the 
   government. Dr. Boskovic has the last vial of the bacterium and is 
   trying to find an antidote to counteract it's effects, but the bac<A HREF="bacterium_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bacterium dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>terium
    gets loose and begins growing, first attaching itself to the crazy 
   doctor and slowly dissolving his flesh from his bones. Beth, Jiggs 
   and Brook are trapped in the house, unable to leave thanks to some 
   government snipers posted in the woods with orders to kill anyone who 
   comes outside. Government agents Dr. Karin Rayburn (Shelley Dague) 
   and Chandler (Andrew Michael Kranz) enter the house to grab the vial, 
   unaware that the bacterium is already on the loose. Chandler becomes 
   the next victim, as the unfeeling Dr. Rayburn transmits live video to 
   Major Larson (Jessica Day) of the organism feeding on lab animals and 
   asexually reproducing. The government has 48 hours to figure out a 
   way to destroy the blobs (dropping a nuclear device and blaming it on 
   terrorists is discussed) and finally decide to use a &quot;black hole 
   bomb&quot; to destroy the threat, but what does this mean for the 
   fate of Beth, Jiggs and Brook? A motorcycle gang, led by Beth's 
   ex-boyfriend, saves their hides just before the black hole bomb 
   explodes and destroys not only the blob (which has grown to enormous 
   proportions), but also Major Larson and her team, in what turns out 
   to be a huge underestimation of the range of the bomb.&nbsp; Way too 
   talky and low-rent for it's own good, <B>BACTERIUM</B> shows none of 
   the playfulness Brett Piper displayed in earlier films like <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#NymphoidBarbarian">A

   (2002), a film I'm not too crazy about, but even it has more meat on 
   the bone than this one does. All we have here is endless inane 
   dialogue spoken by a cast of amateur actors (some doing better than 
   others, especially the guy who finds every conceivable way to say 
   &quot;Are you shitting me?&quot; within 30 seconds), interrupted 
   every now and then by cut-rate blob effects achieved using practical, 
   CGI and model effects. To add insult to injury, the blob attack 
   scenes aren't very bloody (most attacks are achieved by running the 
   film backwards or by simply applying green-colored peanut butter to 
   the victims' faces), but Piper does finally used his patented low-tech
    stop-motion effects work in the finale, where a giant blob grabs a 
   helicopter out of the sky. Too bad he doesn't use more of that 
   imagination throughout the film, because <B>BACTERIUM</B> is Piper's 
   weakest film. The only real humor (besides the &quot;Are you shitting 
   me?&quot; bit) comes when two government officials toss a coin to 
   decide whether or not to use the black hole bomb, because they don't 
   believe the President of the United States has a grasp of the 
   graveness of the situation the world is in (it's a smart jab at the 
   policies of then-President George W. Bush and his backward-steps 
   regarding science in general). The scientist who developed the bomb 
   also seriously underestimates the range of the bomb, because when it 
   goes off, it also obliterates Major Larson's communications station, 
   killing everyone inside. Unfortunately, all the good stuff comes 
   during the film's closing minutes, so I can't in good conscience 
   recommend this to anyone. Also starring Tom Cikoski, John Fedele and 
   Rob Monkiewicz. A Shock-O-Rama DVD Release. It says it's <B>Rated PG-13</B> 
   on the DVD sleeve, but I seriously doubt this was ever submitted to 
   the MPAA, as there is full-frontal nudity early in the film (although

   I said to myself, &quot;Great. Another found footage flick about a 
   reality series.&quot; Thankfully, this film contains precious little 
   found footage (98% of it is regular filmmaking), but my hopes still 
   weren't high because the screenplay was co-written by Jeff O'Brien, 
   who gave us such god-awful films as <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Insecticidal2005">INSECTICIDAL</A></B>

    OF THE GIANT LEECHES</A></B> (2008). This is also the first 
   full-length feature by director/co-screenwriter Philip Granger, who 
   has been a popular actor on TV and films since the early-80's, 
   appearing in major roles in films such as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Barber">THE

   (2014). As a director, Philip Granger is a great actor, but I do 
   appreciate him not going the cheap route and making his first 
   directorial film a found footage one, like most new directors do 
   today. They very<A HREF="bad_building_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bad building poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   seldom work. They make all their money on the first week of their 
   release (because most of them cost less than $5 million to produce) 
   and then are forgotten and sold to cable TV. Out of the hundreds of 
   found footage films out there, I can count all the good ones on one 
   hand, Even Bobcat Goldthwait, a director of highly weird films that I 
   love, struck out with his found footage film <B><A HREF="willow_creek_2013.htm">WILLOW
    CREEK</A></B> (2013) and I curse <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE
    BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</A></B> daily for putting this premise into the 
   hands every person with a video camera, thinking that they can become 
   a filmmaker. Guess what? It doesn't. So I thank Philip Granger for 
   not going that route, when he easily could have, given the premise of 
   this film. And here's the premise: Johnny Craig (Jimmy Breau) is the 
   host of the reality series &quot;America's Most Haunted&quot; and it 
   is taking a nose-dive in the ratings. He promises his bitch of a 
   female network executive that he has come up with a sure winner for a 
   prime time special: He and his camera crew will go into the notorious 
   Desmond Building, a place that no one has occupied since the 1970's. 
   Not even squatters will spend the night there. Here's a little 
   history about the Desmond Building and the property it was built on: 
   Legend has it, that in the early-1800's, a tribe of peaceful Indians 
   inhabited a beautiful pasture. A young religious man, called Reverend 
   McKensie, came upon this beautiful pasture and built a church, where 
   he tried to teach the Indians about the ways of the Lord. The Indians 
   denied the Reverend's teachings (they had their own belief system) 
   and he took it upon himself to punish the heathens, vivisecting 
   hundreds of innocent Indian women and children in retribution and in 
   the name of heresy. The land was purchased for a fair price by 
   Desmond Rothchild, not knowing the history of the land. He decided to 
   build a bank tower on the land that would rival all others. Every 
   step of construction was cursed by evil, thanks to the Indian spirits 
   that occupied the land. To this day, the building is poisoned by 
   evil. The city tried several times to destroy the building, but the 
   building always defended itself (Which brings up a major question: 
   How? Did it file injunctions with the legal system?) The building was 
   killing construction workers while being built and it is still 
   killing people today, so the city has hired guards to patrol the 
   outside perimeter of the building and all windows entering the 
   building had sharp spike strips installed on the outside, to 
   discourage anyone from breaking in. The building has sat unoccupied 
   since the 1970's. (One useless piece of trivia about the building: 
   Every room in this building was built separately. When one room was 
   completed, another was started. No one seems to know why it was built 
   this way and you will never find out.). I think we all can see where 
   this film is heading. It opens with a barely conscious &quot;urban 
   explorer&quot; (a person or persons who explores abandoned places 
   people usually never go and takes photos of their triumphs) laying on 
   the pavement next to the Desmond Building, covered with glass because 
   he either jumped or was thrown from one of the building's windows. 
   The opening credits then start with one of the most popular horror 
   film tropes: newspaper articles and headlines from over the years 
   describing the deaths of the many people who constructed the building 
   or lived in it. This is Johnny's last chance of staying on TV and he 
   can't get permission from the city to film inside the building, so he 
   hires his own set of urban explorers, Danny (Anthony McLean) and Luke 
   (Justin Jones), who were friends with the guy who flew out the window 
   and will help as long as their faces are not filmed, to sneak Johnny 
   and his crew, psychic Monica (Edna Rojas) and camera people Jessie 
   (Bram Costello) &amp; Jana (Nira Jamal) into the building not using 
   normal means and avoiding the guards that patrol the building. But 
   before they enter the Desmond Building, Jana &amp; Monica go to the 
   hospital to interview and film the injured urban explorer, but he 
   starts screaming and has to be sedated. It makes for good TV, even if 
   it means nothing. We then see a bum in the building (One question: 
   How did he get in there unnoticed?) stealing all the brass and copper 
   piping he can find, but he starts to spazz-out like he is being 
   electrocuted and the door to the room closes by itself. Johnny is 
   also open with his crew about the history of the building and even 
   mentions a &quot;burn room&quot;; a fire at a room in the building 
   that killed several people but the fire went out by itself when it 
   got to the room's door. Johnny hopes to get footage of that room. 
   Danny and Luke then take them through the sewer system and enter the 
   building through the basement (There's also a hole in the basement 
   floor that is so deep, it could lead to Hell itself.). Johnny and his 
   crew do not know that their cameras are being fed into a limousine 
   occupied by the show's Producer (Simone Alexander) and an unnamed 
   male network executive and they are watching their every move while 
   getting drunk. Monica sees a strange male Native American ghost 
   (Kindall Charters) standing on a piece of equipment, but when the 
   producer watches the live feed, it looks like Monica is talking to no 
   one (I guess ghosts don't appear on digital tape. I wonder if they do 
   on analogue tape?). Danny and Luke lead Johnny and his crew through 
   some very tight corridors in order to get to the first floor without 
   being detected (There's a male guard that patrols the inside of the 
   building. I mean WTF?!? Doesn't this building kill all humans inside 
   it or are guards off limits? So many good questions, so few 
   reasonable answers.). They make it to the building's boiler room and 
   Danny and Luke let Jimmy and his crew do their thing, while they do 
   their own thing: exploring parts of the building that has not been 
   seen for years. Johnny and his crew head for the lobby and once they 
   get there, they see bloody bare human footprints that lead from the 
   floor&nbsp; and then up a wall (probably the film's creepiest 
   moment), as if the person could walk on walls. Meanwhile, the urban 
   explorers are interested in that deep hole and plan on exploring it 
   later, so they mark it with an &quot;X&quot; with green tape. Jessie 
   is off on his own filming footage in one room, when it suddenly gets 
   cold and he finds the corpse of the thief who tried to steal the 
   copper and brass earlier in the film. The sadistic male guard (Glenn 
   Hoffman) finds Jessie and begins to beat him up, but Jessie escapes 
   and runs for his life, with the guard closely behind him. Johnny and 
   Jana are trapped in a room where the ceiling is soaking with blood (a 
   really bad CGI effect), while Monica meets a female ghost (Havanna 
   Guppy. No thanks, I don't like pet fish. A bad joke to a funny name.) 
   who tells her, &quot;Don't...trust...Johnny!&quot;. Jessie is still 
   trying to avoid the sadistic guard, so he throws his two-way radio 
   away to stop his other group members from trying to contact him 
   (Instead of throwing the radio away, why not just turn it off? The 
   decisions made by Johnny and his crew makes me believe that 
   &quot;America's Most Haunted&quot; doesn't deserve to be on the 
   air.). While Johnny and Jana finally escape the blood-ceiling room, 
   the sadistic guard gets locked in a large safe and screams for 
   someone to save him. Jessie shows up at the safe door and says he 
   will get some help (after he yells through the door, &quot;You're 
   lucky I'm not a dickhead like you!&quot;). Monica joins Johnny and 
   Jana and they go looking for Jessie, while Jessie is trying to find 
   them to help in freeing the guard. Jessie notices the female guard 
   (Paige Farbacher) outside and opens a window to alert her that her 
   comrade is in trouble (she can't get in touch with him because their 
   radios won't transmit through the safe's thick metal walls). Jessie 
   sticks his head out the window and it shuts on his neck, the spike 
   strip on the outside of the window puncturing Jessie's head and 
   killing him. Danny and Luke find Jessie's dead body and <A HREF="bad_building_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bad building sell sheet2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>bring
    it back to Johnny and his crew. Johnny originally blames Danny and 
   Luke for Jessie's death until he watches Jessie's digital tape. 
   Everyone thinks it's time to leave the building, but Johnny pulls out 
   a gun and fires it into the air, saying no one is going anywhere 
   until they get the footage they need (Why aren't the female Producer 
   or the male network executive calling anyone? Are they that desperate 
   to get the &quot;money&quot; shots? Well, if they are as 
   inconsiderate as real-life reality programming executives, my answer 
   would be a resounding yes.). Monica should have listened to the 
   advice the female ghost gave her, as blood begins to drip on Johnny's 
   head from the ceiling above and the whole building goes full-tilt 
   crazy, as it begins to shimmy and shake and Johnny loses his gun to 
   Danny. The only trouble is that the building won't let anyone leave 
   (including the female guard, who is now inside), or as Johnny says, 
   &quot;The building is mad at us!&quot; (Really, Einstein?). They find 
   more bloody child footprints and follow them downstairs, when they 
   discover the doorway they just went through is no longer there. What 
   will they find? Will anyone survive? Do you actually care? Monica 
   loses some fingers on her hand when a door slams shut on it. Jana 
   gets killed in a bloody way that is not made clear. More people die 
   but none of their deaths are memorable (as a matter of fact, the film 
   is not really violent at all and it fails as an atmospheric ghost 
   tale).&nbsp; The main problem with this film is the hole-filled 
   screenplay which asks more questions and answers none of them (that's 
   not counting all the mistakes made in the film itself that we are 
   suppose to take for granted.). Where is the &quot;burn room&quot;? 
   What did the male ghost say to Monica? Why is no one trying to help 
   Johnny and his crew, since they are being monitored (Director Philip 
   Granger wants us to believe that the female Producer and the male 
   executive aren't helping because they are getting drunk on champagne, 
   but that's not the way being drunk works. They are sitting in the 
   back seat of the limousine, so it's not like they will get a DWI if 
   they make a simple cell phone call. It's just foolish.)? Why does 
   Johnny turn into a giant prick with people he has known for years? 
   How come none of the ghosts are dressed as Native Americans? As a 
   matter of fact, the whole screenplay is akin to bringing your own 
   ants to your picnic. It just doesn't make sense. Even though I 
   appreciate it not being a found footage film, it's still is still a 
   poor excuse for a horror film (there's also no nudity to go along 
   with the weak violence). It also ends in the same exact way as the 
   2008 found footage film <B><A HREF="quarantine_2008.htm">QUARANTINE</A></B>.
    That's because there is not an original bone in the entire film. 
   It's derivative of nearly every found footage film made in a deserted 
   building (like <B><A HREF="grave_encounters_2011.htm">GRAVE ENCOUNTERS</A></B> 
   - 2011), only without the found footage angle. Maybe that's why this 
   Canadian-made film hasn't found a distributor on disc yet (except in 
   Germany, where they will release anything). People demand more than 
   dreck like this when they spend their hard-earned money. If you're a 
   member of Amazon Prime, you can see it for free streaming, but that 
   is not something I recommend. Even though the film only runs 75 
   minutes, it seems three times as long. I would recommend Philip 
   Granger remain an actor (He's actually very good at that). Avoid it 
   at all costs. To paraphrase what I use to say to my dog Tiny when he 
   use to steal strips of bacon off my breakfast plate: &quot;Bad 
   building!&quot; Bad, bad building!&quot; Also starring Taylor 
   Hastings, Kayla Lyn Lewis, Meghan Roche, Heidy Rincon Salazar and

   is part of a string of murders that started in the lower 48. More 
   women end up dead at Dexter's hands and he seems to make it look like 
   Chief Corgan was involved. The Chief is relieved of duty and begins 
   to investigate on his own. He comes up with a vital clue that will 
   prove that Dexter was the killer but as he is about to expose him in 
   front of everyone in a bar, he is shot through the back with a 
   shotgun by the first murdered woman's husband. Everyone, including 
   Agent Crawley, believe that the Chief was the killer, so the case is

   (Manoush) and her freak son (Andreas Pape), kill some more campers 
   (axe to the head; machete to the neck) and eat their flesh back at 
   their cabin. That night, a stranger named Marc (director Timo Rose) 
   shows up at our trio's tent and warns them to leave immediately, but 
   they ignore his warnings and tell him to go take a hike. David takes 
   a walk in the woods alone (always a good idea), where he is captured 
   by the cannibal clan's third member, the hulking gasmask-wearing 
   Goliath (Sebastian Gutsche). We watch as Goliath tortures another man 
   in a shed as David watches, cutting off his arm and then removing the 
   poor fellow's liver with a pair of pruning shears and then eating it. 
   David is brought back to the cannibals' cabin and has his head 
   smashed to a bloody pulp with a wooden chair. Michael and Nina go 
   looking for David the next morning and when Michael's leg gets caught 
   in a barbwire booby-trap, Nina leaves him there to go get help, but 
   she gets hopelessly lost. Guess where she ends up? That's right, at 
   the cannibals' cabin. She and Michael end up fighting for their lives 
   when Marc reveals that he's also a cannibal family member and 
   introduces them to even more members. The finale is a total bloodbath 
   of flying body parts, exploding heads and human organs, as Nina and 
   Michael try to escape the clutches of the cannibal clan. My God, make 
   it stop!&nbsp; What is it with Germans and gore films? Director/co-producer/co-writer

   it is revealed that Marc is not only a member of the cannibal clan, 
   he also makes snuff films of all the killings. Leave it to those 
   crazy Germans to throw a snuff film subplot into a gore film. Like 
   Ittenbach, Rose has some sense of style with his camera, but ruins 
   many of the shots with jackhammer editing, artificially scratching 
   the emulsion to give it a &quot;grindhouse&quot; feel, 
   over-processing the film to give it a washed-out look or an

    The film opens with the wheelchair-bound Countess Federica (Isa 
   Miranda; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">DORIAN GRAY</A></B> 
   - 1970) looking out the window of her huge lakeside mansion, a 
   forlorn look on her face. As she is wheeling herself into another 
   room, someone slips a noose around her neck, kicks the wheelchair 
   away and hangs her (Killing #1). It is then revealed that the killer 
   is her husband, Filippo (Giovanni Nuvoletti). He places a suicide 
   note next to his wife's body and is then viciously stabbed in the 
   back by some unknown killer (Killing #2).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A few days later, four young adults enter the Countess' property in 
   a dune buggy. While three of them break into the mansion for some sex 
   and disco dancing, Brunhilde (Brigitte Skay; <B><A HREF="san_babila-8_pm_1976.htm">SAN
    BABILA - 8 P.M.</A></B> - 1976) goes skinnydipping in the bay, gets 
   her foot caught on a rope and dredges-up the corpse of Filippo. 
   Before she can make it to the mansion to tell her friends about 
   discovering the dead body, she is chased by someone, who graphically 
   cuts her throat with a curved blade (Killing #3). Robert (Roberto 
   Bonanni) hears a noise outside, opens the front door and has his face 
   cleaved in two by the same curved blade (Killing #4). The killer 
   pulls the blade out of Robert's face (surprisingly graphic and as 
   good as anything Tom Savini has ever done) and enters one of the 
   bedrooms, where Duke (Guido Boccaccini) and Denise (Paola Rubens) are 
   making love. The killer runs a spear through their naked bodies, 
   pinning them to the mattress (their death throes look like they are 
   still humping! Killings #5 &amp; #6). The Countess' neighbors, the 
   always inebriated tarot card reader Anna (Laura Betti; <B><A HREF="hatchet_for_the_honeymoon_1970.htm">HATCHET
    FOR THE HONEYMOON</A></B> - 1970) and her eccentric husband,

    EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974). Renata wants to know 
   more about her father, Filippo (They hope to inherit the Countess' 
   millions). Paolo tells her that her father was a womanizer and Anna 
   tells the couple that the Countess' fortune is going to Simon 
   (Claudio Volont&eacute;; <B><A HREF="vengeance_1968_dvd.htm">VENGEANCE</A></B> 
   - 1968), who is her illegitimate son. This news doesn't sit too well 
   with Renata or Albert, so they go and see fisherman Simon by the dock 
   on the bay (and, no, he isn't sitting!). While they are talking to 
   him, they find her father's dead body in Simon's boat (his face is 
   engulfed by a live squid, which is very unnerving!). He tells them 
   that he found the body floating in the lake. Renata gets sick, so she 
   goes to the mansion to wash her face in a bathroom, where she 
   discovers the mutilated bodies of the four young adults. Suddenly, 
   caretaker Frank Ventura (Chris Avram; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE
    SLASHER...IS THE SEX MANIAC!</A></B> - 1972) appears, hatchet in 
   hand, and he chases Renata, forcing her to grab a pair of scissors 
   and stabbing him by thrusting her hand through a glass door. Albert 
   checks up on his wife and sees Paolo running out the door. Renata 
   explains to Albert what she has done and tells him he must kill Paolo 
   before he calls the police. Albert strangles Paolo as he is on the 
   phone (Killing #7) and when Anna sees Frank's body, someone lops her 
   head off with the hatchet (Killing #8). Renata then tells Albert that 
   she killed Anna and that they must get rid of Simon so they can 
   inherit the fortune. It turns out Frank is not dead and he tells his 
   wife Laura (Anna Maria Rosati) to go get Simon. Simon accuses Laura 
   of killing Filippo, but she tells him that Frank killed him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A flashback ensues, where we find out what actually happened to 
   Countess Federica on that fateful night. Frank and Laura wanted to 
   buy the bay and the area surrounding it, but the Countess refused 
   because Frank wanted to industrialize the area, ruining its natural 
   beauty. Laura became Filippo's mistress, using sex as a way to get 
   him to kill his wife. The rest is history. When Laura tells Simon the 
   story, he strangles her with his bare hands (Killing #9). This 
   triggers another flashback which shows us that Frank paid Simon to 
   kill his wife (These people are despicable!). Back in the present, 
   Albert kills Simon by impaling him with his own fishing spear, 
   pinning him to a wall (Killing #10). Frank tries to kill Albert, but 
   he gets the upper hand, killing Frank instead (Killing #11). This 
   triggers a fast-forward, where we see Frank and Renata standing 
   outside, Frank burning the Countess' will, thereby letting them 
   inherit her fortune. What they don't see in all their giddiness is 
   someone pointing a shotgun at them. We hear, &quot;Daddy!&quot; and 
   the sound of a shotgun blast, Albert and Renata's lifeless bodies 
   lying on the ground (Killings #12 &amp; <A HREF="twitch_of_the_death_nerve_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/twitch of the death nerve-the blind dead ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="290" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>#13).

    This atmospheric film was directed and co-written by Italy's master 
   of the macabre, Mario Bava (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#PlanetVampires1965">PLANET

   - 1974). Bava was also a master with the camera (he also was 
   cinematographer on this film), knowing how to turn the most ordinary 
   things into something creepy and dangerous (He does it here with 
   squids. I know he is trying to get squids to represent a symbol of 
   something deplorable, but they just come off as creepy. I have no 
   idea why some people eat them. I guarantee they wouldn't be if they 
   watched this film!). What amazes me is that Bava didn't get the 
   recognition he so richly deserved until after his death (in 1980). 
   People now know that he was a genius with a camera and was way ahead 
   of his time, as most of his films still hold up today, Originally

   For once, the English dub is not intrusive, as most of the actors are 
   speaking English) and the alternate European release (in Italian with

   behind the camera. Be sure to listen carefully in the beginning of 
   the film to learn what a &quot;squonk&quot; is. Frank's description

   in 1991 with the first 20 minutes cut out to pick up the pace.&nbsp;

    decided to put back the missing 20 minutes and sell it on DVD-R on <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</A> 
   in a &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; in 2005. Being the badfilm freak 
   that I am, I had to buy a copy. If I could stick my own foot up my 
   ass as punishment, I would. (Have you noticed that my ass gets a lot 
   of mentions in my reviews? I wonder what Freud would have to say 
   about that?) The film has a bunch of college students running into a 
   spaceship that has crash-landed in the woods and the little creatures 
   (that make <B><A HREF="ghoulies_1985.htm">GHOULIES</A></B> look like 
   masterpieces of special effects) begin to devour them, using their 
   flesh to repair the ship, which is made up of living tissue. Needless 
   to say, the nerd of the group, Nelson (Eric C. Bushman), and his 
   underage new girlfriend Laura (Denise Mora) are the only ones that 
   can stop the menace. Nelson steals an egg from the ship in hope of 
   finding a way to destroy the aliens. Other college students, 
   including Nelson's best friend Chubbs (James Jeffries) go to the 
   Sheriff (Ted Esquivel) to report the UFO, but are sent home because 
   Chubbs has a predeliction of pissing on vehicles, one of them being 
   the Sheriff's. There's also a subplot about a bunch of punks, led by 
   Hammerhead (Eric Delabarre), who worship an evil man called Osires 
   (Hector Yanez) who is somehow linked to the spaceship and the aliens. 
   The punks kidnap Nelson, Laura and Sara (Janine Miskulin). Osires and 
   Nelson are somehow connected and a &quot;surprise&quot; ending 
   explains it all (and it's a doozie! Think <B><A HREF="terminator_1984.htm">THE
    TERMINATOR</A></B>.). Oh, dear. Where do I begin to tell you how bad 
   this is? It contains nudity and blood, but the girls are butt-ugly 
   and the gore is of the grade school variety. The sets are threadbare 
   and the acting is beyond the point of being surreal. The action 
   scenes, including one of the worst knife fights ever committed to 
   film (When the girl's throat is cut, blood squirts from the wrong 
   part of the knife.), are pathetic. The music sounds like it was 
   recorded on a Yamaha synthesizer and the DVD is so full of 
   artifacting (since it was recorded on the DVD-R in the LP mode from a 
   VHS tape), that sometimes it's actually physically painful to watch. 
   I actually had to make a copy of this DVD-R so I could watch it 
   without the DVD stopping all the time (don't use labels on DVD-Rs Mr. 
   Contreras). The question remains: Is it the worst horror movie ever 
   made? I don't think so, but it comes damn close. It's at least better 
   than those SOV pieces of shit that float around on video compilations 
   from Brentwood. No label available since it is self-distributed.

    to chop up the crew (I must remind you, this was a PG-Rated film, 
   but there is nothing in the gore and nudity department that is held

   upper deck. After slaughtering a few more of the crew (including a 
   stupid one who is holding a torch right next to the leaking flammable 
   liquid), the boat catches on fire and explodes. Bill calls out 
   Sheila's name a couple of times and is blown overboard, he being the 
   only survivor. Well, he's the only human survivor. The chlorophyll 
   monster washes ashore and runs through the jungle as the opening 
   titles appear. Six months later, as Bill has been rescued by the 
   natives of Blood Island and he goes back to the mainland, he decides 
   to make the trip back to Blood Island, because he hears that Dr. 
   Lorca (Eddie Garcia; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#BambooGodsIronMen">BAMBOO
    GODS AND IRON MEN</A></B> - 1974; he replaces Ronald Remy in the 
   role from the previous film; this time he wears an eyepatch and one 
   side of his face is burned) and his brutal right-hand man, Razak 
   (Bruno Punzalan, who returns from the second film), have survived the 
   explosion of their cave lab on top of a waterfalls and are still 
   experimenting on the natives. Bill wants to stop Dr. Lorca and his 
   experiments once and for all.&nbsp; Also on the ship to Blood Island 
   is reknown photographer/reporter M.J. Russell (Celeste Yarnall; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Velvet Vampire">THE
    VELVET VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1971), who has been assigned by her 
   magazine (kind of like The National Enquirer) to do a photo essay and 
   article on Bill's exploits. Bill doesn't like the idea at all, but 
   you know Bill: There hasn't been a woman he hasn't taken to bed. 
   Right now, Bill has nothing but vengeance on his mind, due to 
   Sheila's murder and Dr. Lorca using the natives as his own 
   experimental subjects. If M.J. wants to find out what is going on at 
   Blood Island, she is going to have to find out for herself. When they 
   get to Blood Island, Bill notices that the village has moved, but the 
   Captain (Beverly Miller, who is a man in case you were wondering) 
   said the village probably moved because the fishing was better, but 
   Bill knows that is a bullshit excuse. The natives are scared of Bill 
   because &quot;the evil one touched you&quot; and many villagers are 
   missing, including beautiful native girl Laida's (Liza Belmonte) 
   father, who she blames on Bill (When M.J. tries to take her photo, 
   Laida slaps the camera away and tells M.J. if she wants her photo, to 
   ask first). Laida also blames Bill for the village moving, because 
   the land it use to be on is now cursed. Bill talks to old friend, 
   village elder Ramu (Alphonso Carvajal, who returns from the previous 
   film). Ramu, who is not too pleased with Bill, tells him that the 
   &quot;green people&quot; are still roaming the jungle and kidnapping 
   or murdering their residents. That night, someone pulls the wire from 
   the generator and the electricity goes out. Bill (who is never 
   without a pistol) checks out the generator and M.J. is nearly killed 
   by a green man, but Laida kills him with a machete. The following 
   morning, Bill, M.J., Laida, the Captain, Ramu and a handful of 
   natives (who are willing to work with Bill) scour the island looking 
   for Dr. Lorca, who everyone on the island thinks is dead because he 
   hasn't been seen since the explosion at the cave six months earlier. 
   They do find a camoflaged tunnel, but before Bill can find the 
   triggering mechanism to open it, they find a building full of rotting 
   native corpses and M.J. falls through a trap door and comes 
   face-to-face with a cobra. Bill kills the cobra with his pistol and 
   rescues M.J.. With the help of Laida and some natives, they keep an 
   eye on the late Mrs. Lopez's mansion (read my review of <B>MAD DOCTOR</B>)
    that night because Bill believes Dr. Lorca is still alive and 
   secretly living there. Bill and Laida see a light shining in one of 
   the windows and when they go to the room, they find a severed human 
   head on a table and Razak lurking around. Bill and Laida chase Razak, 
   when Ramu appears and tells Bill that M.J. has been kidnapped. Bill 
   thinks the hidden tunnel is the key, so he finds the hidden mechanism 
   to open it and they all go inside (it is actually a huge underground 
   cavern). It leads to an outside camp on the other side of the island, 
   which is patrolled by Dr. Lorca's guards and Razak is leading them. 
   They spot M.J. in the camp, but there are too many guards and not 
   enough weapons to save M.J. Bill comes up with a plan: He will follow 
   the guards and M.J. alone, while Ramu and his group (and any 
   additional natives he can talk into coming with him) will go back to 
   the Captain's ship and get all the automatic weapons aboard. Bill 
   will leave a trail the group can follow once they come back. Laida 
   insists that she goes with Bill and this is one lady you don't say 
   &quot;No!&quot; to. Razak leads his group and M.J. deeper into the 
   jungle, with Bill and Laida following them close behind. They set up 
   camp for the night, where one of the guards tries to rape M.J. (lots 
   of naked breasts in this sequence), but Razak puts a gun to his head 
   and threatens to blow it off if he goes any further (I guess even 
   evil right-hand men have their limits). All this happens after M.J. 
   manages to break free from the ropes tied around her hands and she 
   runs right into a dead native tied spead-eagle between two trees and 
   screams (letting the guards know she has escaped) and then runs and 
   falls into a pit of quicksand! (&quot;M.J.&quot; probably stands for 
   &quot;Major Jerk&quot;). Bill and Laida still manage to keep close 
   tabs on M.J. and Bill discovers the waterfalls from the previous 
   film, so he knows where Dr. Lorca is hiding. Bill and Laida settle 
   down for the night and Laida wants to make love with Bill (more 
   female bare breasts), but Bill is still hurting over Sheila's death 
   and can't go through with it. Laida, a normally tough woman, actually 
   understands. We then switch to Dr. Lorca and find out why the 
   chlorophyll monster hasn't been attacking natives for the past six 
   months: Dr. Lorca has actually removed the chlorophyll monster's head 
   and tries to transplant native heads on the monster's body, while the 
   head of the monster watches. Dr. Lorca knows that the monster's head 
   can talk, but it never says anything to him. We watch one 
   particularly disgusting scene of Dr. Lorca removing a native's head 
   from his body (I'm not even certain the MPAA would let this get by 
   with an R-Rating today without some edits) and try to transplant it 
   on the monster's body, but the transplant fails. As Dr. Lorca and 
   Razak leave the room, we hear the head of the monster say, &quot;The 
   day may come soon, Lorca!&quot; Bill suddenly decides that he will 
   surrender to Dr. Lorca, thinking Lorca will not kill him (the logic 
   here is just mind-numbing!) and to get his attention, he throws a 
   guard into a pit full of spikes (more footage that would never be 
   shown in a PG-Rated film today) and the guard that tried to rape M.J. 
   accidentally shoots and kills one of his own men thinking it is Bill 
   (we watch as the blood from his gunshot wounds spurt blood, while he 
   spits blood out of his mouth). Before Bill is captured, Ramu, the 
   Captain and the natives come up with a plan to save Bill and M.J. 
   once he gives himself up. They decide to attack at night under the 
   cover of darkness. Bill is captured by Razak (He says, &quot;Is the 
   doctor in?&quot;), while we see potential green-skinned head donors 
   herded into a shed. M.J. is wearing a rather fetching flowered bikini 
   top with matching sarong, while Bill tries to convince Dr. Lorca that 
   he is on his side because the government gave him no other choice but 
   for him to resign, otherwise he faced time in prison (all of it is a 
   lie; or is it?). Dr. Lorca believes the chlorophyll monster is 
   harmless while its head is removed, but he will soon find out that is 
   not the case. In the meantime, Bill and M.J. find some time to get 
   busy (I guess he forgot all about Sheila after seeing M.J. in her 
   getup, but he certainly does get his share of women, doesn't he?). As 
   nighttime approaches. Bill's plan goes into action, just as Razak 
   picks another green-skinned native to be the recipient of losing his 
   noggin for science. Bill's crew surround the camp and the generator 
   is destroyed, just as Dr. Lorca is about to remove the native's head. 
   They wait for the emergency generator to kick-in, while the two 
   warring parties outside begin killing each other (We see people blown 
   apart with grenades, riddled with bullets, slashed and impaled with 
   machetes and impaled with spears). The backup generator kicks in, 
   which turns out to be bad news for Dr. Lorca. M.J.'s would-be rapist 
   captures her once again with rape on his mind, but Laida<A HREF="beast_of_blood_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beast of blood dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   stabs him in the back. Still not dead, the rapist turns his attention 
   towards Laida, but M.J. finishes him off with a spear to his back 
   (Hey, at least he got two penetrations!). Razak is killed when Bill 
   pumps him full of lead. Laida lets all the infected green people out 
   of the shed, only to discover one of them is her father. The headless 
   chlorophyll monster breaks the bindings from the operating table and 
   the head says to Dr. Lorca, &quot;We can talk now, Lorca!&quot; The 
   headless body tosses Dr. Lorca around like a ragdoll, while the 
   monster's head laughs. The headless body then crushes Dr. Lorca's 
   head with a heavy piece of electronic equipment, but also starts a 
   fire in the process. For those of you looking for the chlorophyll 
   monster to reattach its head with its body as shown on the poster and 
   other advertising material, I'm afraid that never happens, because 
   the entire laboratory caves-in, but not before Bill is able to 
   collect some of Dr. Lorca's paperwork (in order to prove to the 
   scientific community what is going on under their nose; or maybe what 
   he said about being forced to quit was true and he's going to use the 
   information for his own experiments). The natives set the camp on 
   fire and it explodes. So ends the Blood Island Trilogy, but what 
   exactly is in that crate we see the last native carrying away? I'm 
   afraid we will never know, but I would like to think it is the head 
   of the chlorophyll monster. This is the only film of the Blood Island 
   Trilogy that was directed solely by Eddie Romero (<B><A HREF="#Beast Yellow Night">BEAST

   in the series with Gerry De Leon (<B><A HREF="terror_is_a_man_1959.htm">TERROR
    IS A MAN</A></B> - 1959; <B><A HREF="blood_of_the_vampires_1966.htm">BLOOD
    OF THE VAMPIRES</A></B> - 1966) who, for some reason, passed on 
   participating in this film. It's obvious the the headache-inducing 
   rapid in-and-out zooming shots that were in the previous film were 
   DeLeon's idea, because this film has none of it and that's a relief. 
   Although the film starts out rather mild, as it advances it becomes 
   more and more violent. The head transplant scene, where Dr. Lorca is 
   cutting away the skin on the neck is quite surprising for a PG-Rated 
   film, even for back then. John Ashley has always made for a bland 
   action hero, but he publicly stated that he loved doing exploitation 
   films, so at least he got to do what he loved. I just wished he lived 
   long enough to share his stories about the time he spent in the 
   Philippines (a country he loved). He must have had some doozies, 
   especially if the love scene he filmed with Angelique Pettyjohn in <B>MAD
    DOCTOR</B> was the real thing (which Pettyjohn claims). This is a 
   grand end to an interesting trilogy and can probably claim to be the 
   three films that made people aware that there was a film industry in 
   the Philippines. For that we can all be thankful. The TV versions of 
   this film were missing about 10 minutes of footage, so the best way 
   to go is get the cheap <A HREF="http://www.oldies.com">Alpha New Cinema</A> 
   DVD-R, which is a port of the OOP <A HREF="http://www.image-entertainment.com">Image
    Entertainment</A> DVD, minus a couple of extras (The DVD-R still has 
   the Celeste Yarnall interview and she still looks good. It also has a 
   collection of trailers, including the <B>MAD DOCTOR</B> one narrated 
   by a manic Brother Theodore and a commentary track by Sam Sherman). 
   These films have only ever been released in fullscreen, so my hope is 
   that some enterprising DVD company would release all three films in 
   widescreen. But the Philippines film industry was known to not treat 
   their film prints with any care, so widescreen prints may not even 
   exist anymore, unless someone has the Hemisphere Pictures 35mm prints 
   that were released in U.S. theaters. Stranger things have happened.

   bit of privacy we had). This one is a German-made, English language 
   horror film about Robert (Philipp Danne) and two of his friends 
   traveling to his dead scientist Grandfather's house, who created a 
   deadlier strain of Bird Flu and was killed when a murder of crows 
   flew through his windows and killed him, also plucking out his eyes. 
   Robert and his friends Eugen (Nikolas Juergens) and Patrick (Marven 
   Gronen) stop at a mini-mart at a gas station in town and Robert is 
   surprised to see that his ex-love Marlene (Birthe Wolter) now owns 
   the gas station from her dead parents. He always thought she was 
   going to leave town to become a biologist. Marlene asks Robert why he 
   dumped her and Robert replies that it had nothing to do with her and 
   Marlene sarcastically comes back with, &quot;Oh, really. Yeah, why 
   should it have anything to do with me?&quot; She tells Robert that 
   while she runs the gas station, she studies biology at night. Patrick 
   invites busty counter girl Vanessa (Anna Beuer) to a party at the 
   mansion that night and she accepts, while all Marlene can do is 
   scowl. Eugen throws out some garbage from their car into a dumpster, 
   but there's some strange creature in it that is still alive. The 
   three run into the town's bully Bollmann (Ski; yes, just 
   &quot;Ski&quot;) and he tries to stab Robert after telling him, You 
   got some balls coming back to this place, fuckface!&quot;, but 
   Lieutenant Lehmann (Joost Siedhoff) breaks it up, tells Robert to 
   visit his office first thing in the morning to sign some papers and 
   then immediately get out of town.&nbsp; They don't notice that they 
   are being followed by someone and we see two people picking up dead 
   birds off the ground and putting them in plastic bags. Once they get 
   to Robert's grandfather's mansion, they find it in a bad state of 
   disrepair, so they start collecting some of the more valuable items 
   before they sell the mansion. All of his Grandfather's research 
   papers seem to be missing, but he finds the revolver he gave him when 
   he was just about to leave 7 years earlier. Patick and Eugen head 
   downstairs to the wine cellar, where Patrick discovers a weird-shaped 
   bottle full of liquid and brings it upstairs. Eugen discovers that 
   there is a secret room behind the wine cellar rack, but he doesn't 
   open it yet. Robert finds some hidden tapes recorded by his 
   Grandfather about his experiment (seems like the German government is 
   just as weak as ours when it comes to searches) and he listens 
   horrified. Bollmann is drinking with some friends and decides to pay 
   Robert a visit. This is when all shit begins to happen. Lieutenant 
   Lehmann hears a couple of gunshots go off in a house and ignores 
   them. While a giant murder of crows fly overhead, something grabs a 
   citizen and drags him through the woods, killing him. Eugen notices a 
   bunch of dead animals in the woods in the back yard of the mansion 
   and makes the mistake of touching some of them. The girls show up at 
   the mansion and Robert tries to explain to Marlene why he really 
   left.&nbsp; We see a government facility that collects the bodies of 
   the dead animals and two men in an office exchanging money. It seems 
   the birds are causing people to turn into zombies, but the government 
   is trying to cover it up. Like any pandemic, killing a few people is 
   no way to solve a problem and soon Robert and his friends are under 
   attack by zombies at the mansion. Bollmann shows up, but at this time 
   he is at zombie stage and takes a bite out of Patrick's arm (and 
   throws him about 20 feet in the air), so Robert shoots him in the 
   mouth and splatters his brains against a wall and a cuckoo clock 
   behind him. Eugen begins to act strange and tries to kill Patrick 
   with a hypodermic needle full of poison, but Robert stops him. Eugen 
   then tries to commit suicide with Robert's gun, but Robert stops him 
   once again. Eugen enters the secret room behind the wine rack and 
   finds a state-of-the-art laboratory and a pump-action shotgun. 
   Bollman's driver, who drove the car into an empty fountain in front 
   of the mansion and it bursts into flames, comes to the mansion as a 
   zombie in a burned state, but he is killed in a hail of shotgun and 
   gun fire. Robert and Marlene ride bikes into town (a clever little 
   nod to something that happened when Robert first entered town), but 
   Robert is run off the road by someone driving a car. Lucky for him 
   and Marlene, because they see the driver take a big bite out of a 
   female driver's neck, so they turn around and head back to the 
   mansion. Robert makes a cell phone call to the police station to talk 
   to Lieutenant Lehmann, but it is obvious by what he hears that the 
   station is under siege by zombies. In order to find who is infected, 
   they all prick their fingers (except for Patrick, who they are sure 
   is infected and is brought upstairs for quarantine) for samples of 
   blood (in a nod to John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE THING</A></B> 
   - 1982), while everyone listens to Robert's Grandfather's tapes. 
   Eugen is found to be infected, but he pulls Robert's pistol out and 
   leaves the mansion before they can quarantine him. Patrick turns into 
   a zombie and Lieutenant Lehmann is one, too, so Robert shoots Lehmann 
   and Anna crushes his head against a curb. He won't be getting up. The 
   mansion is now under full zombie attack (in a funny scene, one zombie 
   gets a cell phone call from his wife wanting to know what time he 
   will be home for dinner!). Zombie Patrick goes outside, where we see 
   that Marlene is a proficient zombie killer with an axe (The last 
   humane thing Patrick does is shoot two zombies before they bite 
   Marlene). Marlene gets into a fight with Eugen, but she runs away and 
   Eugen gives himself the fatal shot of poison in the hypodermic needle 
   that was meant for Patrick. Patrick and Robert get into a fight,

    lets go of his hand and falls to her death when she sees that 
   Patrick is about to attack Robert again. They both fall off the 
   ledge, but Robert lives when he falls on top of Patrick. As morning 
   comes, both Robert and Eugen are leaning against trees, but only 
   Robert is alive. Robert is taken to a decontamination unit and is to 
   be transported by helicopter to a quarantine unit. An old scientist 
   &quot;friend&quot; of Robert's Grandfather (Who works for the 
   government) tells him that there is no way to stop the virus, so it 
   looks like all of the people of Earth are doomed. The last shot is of 
   a sky-full of crows, while a helicopter transports Robert to a 
   quatantine unit. It's like putting a band-aide on a bullet 
   wound.&nbsp; Made during the Bird Flu scare of the late double 
   naughts (which turned out to be nothing, no matter how many warnings 
   the CDC issued), this is just another zombie film (albeit filmed in 
   Germany and using actual German actors who could speak English very 
   well) made to cash-in on a real-life scare. Director Wolf Wolff (love 
   that name!) and screenwriter Wolf Jahnke (Three &quot;Wolf's&quot; 
   for the price of one!) have given this film some gory scenes, but 
   don't make the film a gore fest. There are many little examples of 
   humor sprinkled throughout the film which makes me believe that both 
   Wolf's didn't take this Bird Flu &quot;epidemic&quot; too seriously 
   (I'll let you discover the humor for yourself, but on some you have 
   to pay very close attention). While this isn't any ground-breaking 
   zombie film and the film is bloody in spots, the unusual locations 
   and the bird attacks make this a decent film to watch if you have 
   nothing better to do. Stay away from the version shown on the&nbsp; 
   Chiller Network on TV because it is heavily edited, not just for 
   violence, but for language and some nudity. My biggest question this 
   film doesn't answer is what happened to Marlene? We see her running 
   away from Eugen and never see her again. Maybe Wolf Wolff (man, I 
   wish I had that name!!!) and Wolf Jahnke were going to use her for a 
   sequel, but the bird flu epidemic died down very quickly and a sequel 
   would have been deemed unnecessary. It's nice seeing even zombie 
   films being made in other countries. It gives the films some 
   much-needed adrenaline and something different to see. This one was 
   also shot on 35mm film rather than the usual digital video cameras, 
   which gives the film some extra &quot;pop&quot; Those that think 
   digital video looks better than film really need to have their heads 
   examined. 99% of them say that because they can't afford to shoot 
   their movies on actual film. Also starring Mark Dimant, Thomas

   Contrary to my opinions expressed in this review, the worldwide 
   2020/2021 Covid-19 pandemic made me appreciate the CDC. They were the 
   voice of reason during a horrible presidency&nbsp; in the United 
   States, where outright lies and ignoring the pandemic cost over 
   400,000 U.S. citizens to lose their lives. My opinion has changed 
   drastically since the 2021 swearing-in of Joe Biden as our new 
   President. Responsibility and some loss of freedom is necessary to 
   fight a pandemic, something I hope I never have to go through again, 
   yet it is August 10th, 2021 as I write this and some politicians and 
   idiotic followers of the previous President (I refuse to mention his 
   name) are keeping Covid alive by refusing to wear masks or get 
   vaccinated. People are stupid, but I never thought they were this stupid!</FONT></FONT></P>

   am (not very many people are), you'll remember all the hubbub about 
   Africanized killer bees making their way from South America to the 
   United States. It was supposed to be a natural disaster in the 
   making, as these aggressive and angry bees reportedly had no problem 
   attacking humans without provocation and, if they stung you enough 
   times, you could die. A disaster of this proportion was ripe for the 
   film industry to exploit and exploit it they did, turning out this 
   low-budget film, countless TV movies (such as <B><A HREF="savage_bees_1976.htm">THE

    SWARM</A></B> (1978). This Mexico-produced film purports that South 
   America has been completely taken over by the killer bees and they 
   are beginning to gain a strong foothold in Latin America and Mexico. 
   Dr. Franklin Miller (Claudio Brook; <B><A HREF="alucarda_1975.htm">ALUCARDA</A></B> 
   - 1975) and his wife Sandy (Angel Tompkins; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#LittleCigars1973">LITTLE

   killer bees in a small Brazil town in hopes of making them less 
   aggressive and more docile by using crossbreeding techniques with 
   normal honeybees. But when a father and his young son accidentally 
   set some &quot;devil bees&quot; loose when they try to steal some<A HREF="bees_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bees poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   honey, resulting in the stinging death of the young boy, the locals 
   come bearing torches and burn down Dr. Miller's home and laboratory, 
   setting loose all the killer bees that were in captivity. Sandy 
   survives by hiding in a walk-in freezer, but Franklin and most of the 
   locals are stung to death. At the United Nations, Dr. John Norman 
   (John Saxon; <B><A HREF="#Cannibal Apoc">CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE</A></B> 
   - 1980) and bee expert Dr. Sigmund Hummel (John Carradine; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Vampire Hookers">VAMPIRE
    HOOKERS</A></B> - 1979) try to convince the countries of the world 
   (in one of the chintziest office sets in recent memory) how it would 
   be in everyone's interest to convert the killer bees to hybrids and mass-produce
    their honey, thereby curbing worldwide hunger (When the 
   representative from Cuba complains that stepping-up honey production 
   will severely curb their sugar cane sales, Dr. Hummel breaks a jar 
   containing some bees and clears out the room in a hurry. Take that, 
   Cuba!). Sandy comes to New York with her dead husband's notes and a 
   suitcase full of killer bees (so much for Customs!) to work with John 
   and her Uncle Sigmund (A couple of thieves try to rob Sandy in an 
   elevator, but they get stung repeatedly, one crashing through a glass 
   door and the other getting hit by a car). As our trio try to find a 
   way to tame the killer bees (Big business wants to secretly bring the 
   bees to America to harvest their special brand of royal jelly for the 
   cosmetic industry), huge swarms of the bees suddenly appear across 
   the U.S., killing everyone in their path. Can our trio discover a way 
   to render the bees harmless (They have a way to turn the bees gay!) 
   before these little buggers dominate America? Talk about a 
   buzzkill!&nbsp; This ridiculously ludicrous horror flick, directed/produced/written

   - 1989), is full of so many unintentionally hilarious set pieces, 
   it's hard to dislike it. My favorite sequence comes when an old man 
   with rheumatism offers two boys in a park two dollars to catch five 
   bees in a paper bag, which he intends to use on his leg (He says the 
   bee stings make his leg feel better!). Another boy, jealous that he 
   wasn't offered money to catch the bees, throws his baseball at a huge 
   killer bee nest and the bees attack and kill everyone in the park, 
   including the old man! There's another scene where John Carradine 
   (doing his best German accent while waving around his arthritis-stricken
    hands) has developed a computer program that can translate the 
   buzzing made by the killer bees into English and he begins 
   interpreting a conversation between two bees in front of an amused 
   Saxon (the look on his face is priceless). The final scene, where all 
   the bees use Sigmund's computer program to talk to John and Sandy and 
   then to all the members of the U.N., is worth the price of admission 
   alone. Jack Hill (<B><A HREF="spider_baby_1964.htm">SPIDER BABY</A></B> 
   - 1964) did some uncredited work on the screenplay, which may be why 
   some of the dialogue is intentionally funny, especially Carradine's. 
   Though not very violent (it's mainly shots of people flailing their 
   arms at some superimposed bees, followed by some shots of stung, 
   swollen bodies), <B><A HREF="bees_1978b.htm">THE BEES</A></B> is a 
   campy, fun romp that mixes corporate espionage and horror genres with 
   some laugh-out-loud process shots of the bees attacking the U.S. 
   landmarks, including the Capital Building in Washington, D.C. Also

   (1994), while the others would disappear into obscurity, make more 
   low-budget genre films, retire or pass away. <B><A HREF="being_1981c.htm">THE
    BEING</A></B> opens with an off-screen narrator opining that in the 
   small town of Pottsville, Idaho &quot;strange and unexplained events 
   are occurring. Some people are missing, among them, a little child. 
   The ultimate terror has taken form and Pottsville, Idaho will never 
   be the same.&quot; (As this is being said we see four people 
   picketing on Main Street, but we don't know what they are picketing 
   against...yet). We then witness a kid in a baseball cap running for 
   his life in what looks like a septic tank graveyard. The kid then 
   hides in an auto junkyard (Pottsville is already beginning to look 
   like a shithole) and eventually steals a car, where he finds the time 
   to turn on the radio even though he is scared witless! But there's 
   some type of creature on the car's roof and it punches its taloned 
   hand through the metal roof and gorily rips the kid's head off, the 
   car crashing into crates of potatoes (this is Idaho, after all!). 
   Detective Mortimer Lutz (producer William Osco, here using the name 
   &quot;Rexx Coltrane&quot;) is in charge of the case, where a slimy 
   green substance is found in the car among the plentiful blood, but 
   the boy's body is missing. After the tow truck driver tows the car to 
   the lot, he pops the trunk, but decides to smoke a cigarette before 
   looking inside. Big mistake. While his back is turned, something 
   opens the trunk all the way and when Det. Lutz returns, he notices 
   the green slime and drives away, unaware that the creature is 
   watching him from the truck of the towed car. Back at the police 
   station, Det. Lutz watches a local news program where 
   environmentalist-for-hire Garson Jones (Martin Landau; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Return 1980">THE
    RETURN</A></B> - 1980) defends the town's water supply, saying that 
   accusations that it is contaminated by radioactive waste (Pottsville 
   was picked as &quot;the most sophisticated dump site in the 
   country&quot;) are blown way out of proportion. To prove it, he whips 
   out a geiger counter and runs it over his watch and then a glass of 
   the town's water and says that his watch has more radiation than the 
   water (Totally ignoring the fact that water shouldn't register any 
   radiation at all!). He then goes on to say that there are many types 
   of radiation that are harmless (Really?!?). We then see two teens 
   making out in their car at a drive-in (Where a cheesy fake horror 
   movie plays on-screen that has a naked girl attacked by a monster in 
   her bedroom. The marquee says that is is playing <B><A HREF="silent_scream_1980.htm">SILENT
    SCREAM</A></B> [1980], but this scene was definitely not in that 
   film!), when every opening in the interior of their car starts oozing 
   the slimy green substance. The creature kills them both (off-screen) 
   and then pulls a stoner out of his driver's side window, killing him, 
   too (again off-screen), while his high buddy watches with his mouth 
   gaping open with a joint in his hand. Det. Lutz goes to the drive-in, 
   checks out the teens' car and sits in a big pile of green slime. He 
   also checks out the stoner's driver door, which is also covered in 
   green slime with a hole in the ground right next to it (the creature 
   travels by burrowing underground, although it seems to like car 
   rides, too!). Lutz then drives home (where his pants are suddenly 
   slime-free, in one of the film's many continuity errors) and flips 
   the covers of his bed to go to sleep. He instantly notices that his 
   bed is full of green slime and the creature grabs his leg from under 
   the bed. Lutz breaks free and runs outside, with the creature (which 
   we still haven't fully seen) following close behind. Lutz loses the 
   creature when he runs in front of a train and barely makes it across 
   (the film's only really good jump scare happens when Lutz looks up 
   after he makes it across the tracks in the nick of time). We then 
   switch to the local church on <B><A HREF="easter_sunday_1981.htm">EASTER
    SUNDAY</A></B> (the film's original title), where Virginia Lane 
   (Ruth Buzzi; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Diggin Up">DIGGIN' UP BUSINESS</A></B> 
   - 1990), the town's crusader against pornography (which would explain 
   the picketers in the beginning of the film), is holding an Easter Egg 
   Hunt for Pottsville's children. The children start picking up Easter 
   eggs looking for the prize-winning egg, but whenever extremely young 
   girl Suzie (played by Kong &amp; Osco's real-life daughter Roxanne 
   Cybelle, who is also the little girl on the <B>EASTER SUNDAY</B> 
   poster) goes to pick up an egg, some other child beats her to it. 
   Suzie finds a nice red egg, but accidentally kicks it into a hole 
   where the creature is waiting. Instead of grabbing and killing Suzie 
   when she reaches into the hole to retrieve the egg, the creature 
   gives her the prize-winning egg instead (it does makes sense once you 
   figure out just what the creature is). Virginia announces to the rest 
   of the children that Suzie is the winner and then asks the little 
   girl, &quot;Did you see the Easter Bunny?&quot;, not knowing Suzie 
   has just seen something a lot more dangerous. Det. Lutz reports what 
   happened to him to town Mayor Gordon Lane (Jos&eacute; Ferrer; <B><A HREF="blood_tide_1982.htm">BLOOD
    TIDE</A></B> - 1982), but it is apparent that the Mayor is working 
   in cahoots with Garson Jones to cover-up the leaking radiation in the 
   town's water supply. The Mayor orders Det. Lutz to &quot;stamp out 
   all rumors&quot; and appoints Garson to investigate the matter. The 
   Mayor and Garson are keeping the people's minds occupied with the 
   Mayor's wife Virginia's campaign to stamp out pornography in 
   Pottsville, even though there are no outlets in Pottsville that 
   actually sell pornography (When Det. Lutz asks Virginia why she and 
   her supporters are picketing in front of an empty store, she tells 
   him it could become a massage parlor!). Lutz tells his girlfriend, 
   diner waitress Laurie (Marianne Gordon; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demon Hunter">DEMON
    HUNTER</A></B> - 1965), to wait for him when her shift is over, 
   while Deputy Dudley (Associate Producer Kent Perkins) has his heart 
   graphically ripped out of his chest by the creature, who is sitting 
   in the back of Dudley's police car and shoves it's arm through the 
   Deputy's back and shows him his beating heart before he dies (that's 
   what he gets for calling an illegal Mexican fisherman a &quot;taco 
   bender&quot; earlier in the film). Garson still defends the dumpsite 
   on-camera and to prove his point to the media, he camps out at the 
   dumpsite later that night. In the film's most bizarre sequence, 
   Detective Lutz has a black &amp; white nightmare where he and Garson 
   are flying in a prop plane and Garson is pulled out of the plane by 
   the creature (who we still haven't fully seen). Garson hangs on to 
   the plane's wing begging Lutz for help, before the creature pulls him 
   off and he falls to his death. He then sees Virginia, bleeding out of 
   her eyes and flying a broomstick (the picketers use broomstick as a 
   symbol for sweeping pornography out of town), while looking at Lutz 
   and telling him, &quot;It's all in your mind, Mort. It's all in your 
   mind!&quot; The phone rings and it is Garson telling him to come to 
   the dumpite immediately, but he forgot all about Laurie and runs to 
   the diner to pick her up (I guess the town is really small!). As they 
   are about to get into Laurie's car, the creature lunges at them, but 
   they escape and Laurie manages to trap the creature in the diner's 
   freezer (we finally get a small glimpse of the creature's face). Lutz 
   calls the Mayor to come to the diner to see the proof with his own 
   eyes, but when he arrives and opens the freezer door, there is 
   nothing but a puddle of goo. The Mayor threatens to fire Lutz if he 
   makes one more mistake. Lutz and Laurie head to the dumpsite to meet 
   Garson, while anti-porn picketers Arn (Murray &quot;The Unknown 
   Comic&quot; Langston), Willis (singer Kinky Friedman) and John 
   (fringe comic Johnny Dark) break into the empty store (Willis finds a 
   stack of Playboys and starts looking at the nude photos) and are 
   killed by the creature (the three are in the film for less than two 
   minutes, maximum). A strange old lady named Marge Smith (Dorothy 
   Malone; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#RestInPieces1987">REST IN PIECES</A></B> 
   - 1987), who the neighborhood kids relentlessly prank (we see a kid 
   throw shit on the front door of her house earlier in the film, while 
   the creature pays her a visit), is walking outside in the rain 
   yelling, &quot;Michael, where are you?&quot; At the same time, 
   Virginia is hosting a formal party at her home, while the Mayor takes 
   a few nips in his car in the garage. He sees the creature and puts 
   the car in<A HREF="easter_sunday_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/easter sunday aka the being poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   reverse, crashing through the garage door and speeding off. Virginia 
   hears the commotion and heads outside, where the creature's long 
   tongue wraps around her neck and kills her (off-screen). At the 
   dumpsite, Garson is attacked and nearly killed by the creature's 
   tongue, but Laurie chops it off with an ax, while Lutz fires his 
   shotgun in the hole the creature escapes in. In the finale, we 
   discover the creature (who has one eye and a big mouth with very 
   sharp teeth) is actually Marge Smith's mutated son Michael, who 
   disappeared at the dumpsite weeks earlier. Now the only question is 
   who will survive this genetic mutation (Hint: Garson ends up being 
   torn to pieces and Lutz doesn't come away unscathed)?&nbsp; This 
   ridiculously inane, yet highly watchable, horror flick has too many on-screen
    errors to mention, the most notable is how some scenes start out at 
   the dead of night and end during the bright daylight in a matter of a 
   minute. It's no wonder why this film sat on the shelf for three years 
   before finding theatrical distributors (both Best Film &amp; Video 
   and New World) and then a quick VHS release. The film is 
   unintentionally funny in spots, such as the scene when Lutz and 
   Garson have an easy way to avoid the monster, but decide to save a 
   cat instead, putting both their lives in unnecessary danger. I did 
   laugh out loud when Lutz gets beat-up mercilessly by the creature, 
   being tossed around like a ragdoll, only for him to step on a nail 
   when he gets away! The bearded William Osco (you can read more about 
   him in my review of <B><A HREF="#BloodDiner1987">BLOOD DINER</A></B>) 
   is simply a terrible actor here (it also sounds like he has been 
   dubbed), but he looks striking similar to Jonathan Frakes when he 
   appeared in the TV series <B><A HREF="star_trek_the_next_ generation_tv_series_1987-1994.htm">STAR
    TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION</A></B> (1987 - 1994). He is in about 85% 
   of the scenes in the film, so you'll have to overlook his bad acting 
   (or enjoy it because it is bad) to get through this film. Everyone 
   else, besides Martin Landau, have glorified extended cameos and it 
   looks like their scenes could have been shot in a day. Some of the 
   practical gore effects (by Mark Bussan) are very well done, but they 
   are few and far between, as most of the killings are done off-screen. 
   The reveal of the creature in the finale is a ridiculous concoction, 
   but its goofiness only adds to the film's charms (The film ends with 
   supposedly funny future reveals about the surviving cast members, but 
   instead of being funny, it is just lame). Director/screenwriter 
   Jackie Kong only directed three more feature films (metioned at the 
   beginning of this review) before retiring as a filmmaker and becoming 
   a real estate agent. Believe me, this is hardly a good film, but if 
   you are in the right frame of mind, you'll probably enjoy it for all 
   the wrong reasons. Also starring Ellen Blake, Bill Rawlinson, Eric 
   Helland and Jerry Marin as the creature. Originally released on

This is director Jonathan Mostow's <A HREF="beverly_hills_bodysnatchers_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beverly hills bodysnatchers vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>first
    full-length film (listed here simply as &quot;Jon Mostow&quot;). As 
   we all know, he would later go on to direct the excellent <B><A HREF="terminator_3_2003.htm">TERMINATOR
    3: RISE OF THE MACHINES</A></B> (2003), one of the only major motion

   Mostow falters on his first film, a comedy retelling of <B><A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> 
   (1985), mixed with some Mafia hijinx. Mortuary owner Lou (Vic Tayback 
   of <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Blood And Lace">BLOOD AND LACE</A></B> 
   - 1970) and scientist Doc (Frank Gorshin) borrow money from the mob 
   to fund Gorshin's research in reanimating dead bodies. Mob underling 
   Vic (Art Metrano) sends his nephews Freddie (Rodney Eastman) and 
   Vincent (Warren Selko) to work at the mortuary when Lou is late 
   paying back the money. Vic has plans of becoming boss and has Don 
   Carlo (Seth Jaffe) knocked-off while playing a round of golf. When 
   Don Carlo is sent to the mortuary, he is injected with Doc's serum 
   and becomes a mindless killing machine, offing anyone who gets in his 
   way. Vic is unaware of this and makes plans with Don Ho (Keone Young) 
   to join forces and become one big crime family. Don Ho will only do 
   this if he can see Don Carlo's body at his funeral. More 
   &quot;hilarity&quot; ensues when Freddie, Vincent, Lou and Doc try to 
   bring back an escaped reanimated Don Carlo back to his funeral in 
   time for Don Ho to see the body. Everything works out in the end as 
   Doc perfects his formula and is able to bring back Don Carlo to a 
   regular human state, much to the annoyance of Vic. A tacked-on 
   &quot;surprise&quot; ending promises a sequel which, thankfully, 
   never materialized. Mostow tries hard here with a cast of pros but 
   the juvenile screenplay by P.K. Simonds Jr. give most of the players 
   nothing to do except scream at each other and look confused. There 
   are whiffs of laughter to be had, but nothing that hasn't been done 
   before and much better. A near total lack of blood and gore also 
   don't help much either. There is some nudity, some mindless zombies 
   walking around and a display on how to properly embalm a body (done 
   much better in HBO's <B><A HREF="six_feet_under_tv_series_2001-2005.htm">SIX

   distance and watch Mostow's other great film <B><A HREF="breakdown_1997.htm">BREAKDOWN</A></B>

   Although this low-budget regional film (lensed in Long Island, NY and 
   northern New Jersey) boasts poor acting and a nonsense story, it does 
   contain some good graphic bloodletting and a finale that goes way 
   beyond the borders of good taste for a U.S.-made production. A father 
   and son are on a camping trip when Dad gets his leg caught in a bear 
   trap. Unable to<A HREF="beware_children_at_play_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bewarechildrenatplay.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   free himself (and mistakenly thinking that help is on the way), the 
   father tells his young son the story of Beowulf&#146;s Grendel 
   (don&#146;t ask!) while maggots eat away at his wounded leg. Dad dies 
   and the son goes bonkers, ripping out Dad&#146;s heart and eating it. 
   Flash forward 10 years to a nearby town where 13 children have come 
   up missing. The local police are unable to solve the disappearances 
   (it&#146;s a miracle that they can find their own station), so they 
   call in a writer of paranormal stories to help them find out what is 
   going on. More children disappear (including the writer&#146;s 
   daughter), adults begin showing up dead and devoured and the 
   townspeople start showing signs of developing a mob mentality. It 
   seems the children have become cannibals and their leader is the boy 
   (now a young adult) who was left in the woods 10 years earlier. In 
   the finale, the townspeople locate the kids&#146; hideout in the 
   forest and slaughter all of them (except for one), killing the writer 
   in the process. It is this finale that makes the film really 
   disturbing. Children are shown getting shot in the back, having their 
   heads blown off, having axes planted in their bodies and pitchforks 
   shoved through their necks, all in loving close-up. Director Mik 
   Cribben (who also appears as the religious farmer who leads the adult 
   revolt) spares no gore in other scenes as we view a man cut in half, 
   a nasty throat slashing, various cannibalistic atrocities and a rape 
   committed on the writer&#146;s wife by the demented mountain boy. The 
   effects range from amateurish to quite good. If you like gore, this 
   is the film for you. If you want something more, then pass this one

   As Father George (David Brandon) is giving last rites to female mass

    a hole in the wall of Carole's bedroom that emits a bright light 
   only when she's around. It gives her nightmares of being trapped in a 
   coffin and, one night, the light burns her face. Peter's bible also 
   flies into a puddle, there's a statue of a black swan that rocks by 
   itself and an old radio plays satanic chants, even though it's not 
   plugged in. The family also must contend with flying plates and 
   silverware, some mysterious entities cloaked in black and a head that 
   tries to break through the hole in the wall. Peter performs an 
   impromptu exorcism, which quiets things down for a little while. 
   Peter goes to his superior, Reverend Jonathan (Stephen Brown), who 
   tells Peter he knows about the house's history (the bastard!) and he 
   should work with Father George, not knowing that Father George is now 
   an alcoholic who sees visions of the dead children being led around 
   by Bette. Carole comes down with a mysterious fever and then it 
   disappears (&quot;The bad people gave it to me!&quot;). When the 
   spectre of Bette comes to the house and takes Martin, Father George 
   appears (&quot;Your son is in an infernal limbo!&quot;) and announces 
   that the house is a gateway to another dimension. They break down the 
   wall with the hole in it and rescue Martin, or at least they think 
   they do. George must regain his faith and perform an exorcism, not 
   only to free Martin of his possession, but to cleanse the house of 
   evil spirits. He fails miserably. Can Peter pick up the slack and

   be put to rest (no pun intended). Everyone that he tells about the 
   dream ends up dead, killed by a long-clawed demon that rips the flesh 
   from their bodies or squeezes their heads until the brains pop out. 
   They then end up completely forgotten by everyone, except Ben, as if 
   they never existed. Ben, with the help of Professor Eric Baxter (Rick 
   Kesler), uncover the truth behind the dream. It involves a book 
   written years before by a Mr. White (Dan White) who had the same 
   dream as Ben. The demon needs the book to stay in the real world and 
   Ben has the only remaining page of it in his possession. Ben must 
   find a way to lure the demon back to the dream world where it can do 
   no harm to anyone except to give bad nightmares. This is director Jay 
   Woelfel's first full-length film, made with the cooperation of Ohio 
   State University. Woelfel would later go on to direct <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Unseen Evil">UNSEEN

   Lola (Raquel Ramirez) takes her married paramour (Adolfo Gallego) to 
   a &quot;romantic&quot; place in the woods to fool around (She says 
   that she would feel like a &quot;whore&quot; if they had sex in a 
   cheap motel room!). When Lola tries to steal his wallet and he 
   catches her, she stabs him several times in the chest with her handy 
   switchblade (after kneeing him in the nuts) and rummages his bloody 
   corpse of all his valuables. She then walks to the nearest phonebooth 
   (this is before the advent of cellphones) <A HREF="mas_alla_del_terror_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beyond terror poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    calls her brother Nico (Emilio Siegrist) to meet her for a drug 
   deal. After making the drug deal, Lola (who is a cunt with a capital 
   &quot;C&quot;), Nico, Chema (Francisco Sanchez Grajera) and Jazz 
   (Martin Kordas) head out on their motorcycles for a night of 
   troublemaking, starting with stopping at a diner. They rob everyone, 
   but when a passing pedestrian spots the robbery and calls the cops, a 
   shootout occurs, in which two cops and all the diner patrons are shot 
   dead, except for Linda (Alexia Loreto) and Jorge (Antonio Jabalera). 
   The two innocents are taken hostage (Chema shoots Jazz in the head 
   when he is wounded in the gunfight!), their car is stolen and 
   everyone heads out to the country to avoid more police. When Nico 
   stupidly stupidly pours booze over Jorge's head while he is driving, 
   Jorge crashes the car (he and Nico then get into a fight), forcing 
   everyone to hoof it on foot. They come upon a house, where Lola is 
   attacked by a dog on the front lawn and Chema is forced to shoot it. 
   They break into the house and force the owner, an old lady (Andree 
   Van De Woestyne) who Nico calls a &quot;witch&quot; (it's prophetic 
   to say the least), to her knees by throwing a heavy object against 
   her back. Lola abuses the old lady, slapping and kicking her while 
   ripping an unusual necklace off of her neck (When Linda tries to 
   intervene, Lola slaps her around and calls her a 
   &quot;cocktease&quot;). While Chema and Jorge are upstairs in the 
   bathroom cleaning up (increduously, Jorge tells Chema [who is totally 
   naked] that he can keep Linda if he lets him go!), they find a young 
   boy crying in his bedroom, so Chema locks the bedroom door so the boy 
   cannot escape. After receiving a mysterious phone call that sounds 
   like someone in the throes of a &quot;death rattle&quot;, Chema and 
   the group steal the old lady's car, but not before setting fire to 
   the house with the old lady and the little boy trapped inside. Little 
   do they know that the old lady is a Satan worshipper and with her 
   last dying breath, she curses all those involved in her and the boy's 
   deaths. The Dark Lord is gonna have some fun tonight!&nbsp; Up until 
   the old lady bites it, this film (original title: <B><A HREF="mas_alla_del_terror_1980.htm">MAS
    ALLA DEL TERROR</A></B>) plays like a standard crime thriller, with 
   robberies, beatings and shootings. But once the gang and their 
   hostages get into the old lady's car (which plays music on the radio 
   that can't be turned off and drives them to an abandoned church, 
   where the shit hits the fan), the film shifts gears (pardon the pun) 
   and turns into a gory horror flick. Director/screenwriter Tomas Aznar (<B><A HREF="book_of_good_love_1975.htm">THE

   - 1987), who uses the pseudonym &quot;Alfredo Casado&quot; here, and 
   Miguel Lizondo, populates the film with the most unlikable characters 
   (the only person who generates any sympathy is Linda, but the only 
   reason she is in the middle of this mess is because she is cheating 
   on her husband and, as we soon learn, has some not-so-nice secrets of 
   her own), so when they start meeting their maker, the viewer does get 
   a sense of satisfaction. Once at the dilapidated church (where Chema 
   screws a receptive Linda and Nico masturbates in front of Lola!), the 
   supernatural shenanigans begin, starting with Jorge being burned 
   alive in the car after seeing the ghostly visage of the dead young 
   boy and the other four meeting creepy kid Andras (David Forrest), who 
   tells them that there is a fortune in treasure in the church's 
   catacombs, but it is guarded by the mummies of those buried there. 
   What they find in the catacombs is creepy, atmospheric and gory, as 
   our group split-up (why do they always do that in horror movies?) and 
   discover that they are individually in a Hell of their own making.

   William Olsen and his Code Red DVD company released a <A HREF="beyond_the_door_1974_dvd.htm">Two-Disc
    Collector's Edition DVD</A>; the first disc containing the complete 
   overseas uncut 109-minute version (under the European title <B><A HREF="devil_within_her_aka_beyond_the_door_1974.htm">THE

   and the second disc containing the 97-minute U.S. theatrical release

   the success of <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE EXORCIST</A></B> (1973), 
   but this Italian-made film (partially filmed in San Francisco) puts 
   its own unique spin on demonic possession. Sometimes you don't need 
   big-budget horror films to make you happy. Sometimes all it takes is 
   a down-and-dirty low-budget genre flick to satisfy your needs and <B><A HREF="beyond_the_door_1974b.htm">BEYOND
    THE DOOR</A></B> (original title: <B><A HREF="beyond_the_door_chi_sei_1974.htm">CHI
    SEI?</A></B> [&quot;Who Are You?&quot;]) fits the bill nicely. The 
   film opens with the camera panning a dark room where many candles are 
   lit while we hear Satan's voice on the soundtrack, speaking to 
   someone we haven't seen yet (it is a very creepy and well-done 
   sequence and it is missing from the U.S. version). We the see a young 
   Jessica Barrett (Juliet Mills; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Waxwork 2">WAXWORK
    II: LOST IN TIME</A></B> - 1991) standing in that room looking down 
   at a totally nude girl (who looks just like her) spread-eagle on a 
   backlit pentagram (nothing is left to the imagination and it is also 
   missing from the U.S. print) and sees the girl's face turn into Jesus 
   Christ&nbsp; (it is quite shocking). Scared out of her mind, Jessica 
   tries to run away, but falls into the arms of her first-ever lover 
   Dimitri (the late Richard Johnson; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightChild1975">NIGHT
    CHILD</A></B> - 1975) before she breaks free and runs away, never to 
   see Dimitri again. A few years later, we then see Dimitri driving a 
   car down a cliffside road while Satan is talking to him (off-screen). 
   Dimitri loses control of the car and it goes flying off the cliff, 
   but Satan freezes the car in mid-air and makes a pact with him: If 
   Dimitri can find Jessica and her unborn child, he will let Dimitri 
   live for a few more years. We then see a pregnant Jessica driving a 
   convertible in San Francisco with her young children, Gail (Barbara 
   Fiorini), who has the mouth of a truck driver, and Ken (David Colin, 
   Jr.), who is picking up the same foul-mouthed habits of his older 
   sister. While they are driving and the opening credits roll, we see a 
   band in a recording studio playing a song called &quot;Bargain With 
   The Devil&quot;, which is about a man selling his soul to the Devil 
   to win the love of a girl for one day and night (It's quite 
   ingenious, actually.). Since this is the 70's, Jessica leaves her 
   kids in the car while she goes shopping at Safeway to pick up things 
   for Ken's birthday that night. We then see someone (face not seen) 
   give Ken a present wrapped in black with a gold ribbon around it. 
   Jessica and the kids then pick up husband/father Robert Barrett 
   (Gabriele Lavia; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP RED</A></B> 
   - 1975), who we saw previously as the sound engineer in the studio 
   complaining about the band's performance, saying such things as 
   &quot;It's got about as much balls as a castrated jellyfish!&quot; 
   and &quot;It sounds like a jerkoff session in the bathroom!&quot;, 
   which the band is not too happy about. When they all arive home, 
   Jessica tells Robert that she is seven weeks pregnant and Robert 
   seems pleased. While Ken and his young friends are celebrating his 
   birthday, Robert finds Jessica puking up blood in the bathroom and 
   she tells Robert that she feels as if the baby is 
   &quot;suffocating&quot; her. She goes to friend Dr. George Staton 
   (Nino Segurini; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Amuck1971">AMUCK</A></B> - 
   1971) for a checkup, where he tells Jessica that she is actually 
   three months pregnant, but Jessica says that cannot be because she 
   had her period seven weeks ago. George tells her that tests don't lie 
   and Jessica immediately becomes worried if the baby is going to be 
   &quot;abnormal&quot;. It is then that strange events begin happening 
   to Jessica and her family. While Jessica is looking through some old 
   photos, she comes upon one with her and Dimitri, which upsets her 
   greatly. She purposely throws a heavy glass ashtray into the side of 
   Robert's very expensive aquarium, shattering it and killing all the 
   fish (She tells her husband over the phone, &quot;I wanted to break 
   it!&quot;). One night while sleeping in bed with Robert, Jessica 
   hears the Devil's voice and begins to float through the air in the 
   standing position (very well-done and extremely creepy), while little 
   Ken watches horrified (he saw his mother break the aquarium, too). 
   George has lunch with Robert and tells him he is extremely worried 
   about how rapidly Jessica's baby is developing and thinks the 
   accelerated pregnancy is due to paranornal activity, so George 
   suggests his wife Barbara (Elisabeth Turner; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977), Jessica's good friend, be her constant 
   companion when Robert is not around (which is often). While they are 
   having lunch, Robert keeps seeing Dimitri stare at him, but since he 
   doesn't know him, he just blows it off. Jessica confides in Barbara 
   that she was once Dimitri's lover for a short period when she was 
   younger, but the experience she had at the ritual (the one we saw in 
   the beginning of the film) freaked her out so much, she never saw 
   Dimitri again. Ken has a nightmare at night and wakes up screaming 
   (Gail tells him, &quot;Cool it. You are blowing my mind!&quot; 
   Hearing that come out of a child's mouth made me laugh.) and Robert 
   discovers a bite mark on Ken's upper chest. While Robert and Gail 
   leave the room to call George, Jessica enters the bedroom and kisses 
   her young son like she would a lover, not a mother (Again, creepy.). 
   George examines Ken and says he is alright, but Jessica slaps Gail 
   hard across the face and angrily walks off, complaining about Gail 
   eating &quot;candy and other garbage&quot; (Yes, Jessica is losing 
   it.). Jessica tells George at his office the following morning that 
   she gets hostile and violent for no reason at all and demands that he 
   performs an abortion (She says, &quot;If you don't do it, I'll do it 
   myself! I'll do anything to get rid of it!&quot;). George tells her 
   that is is a definite possibility, but the Jessica does an 
   about-face, screaming, &quot;It's my child, you filthy murderer! Do 
   you hear me? It will be born! I'll kill anyone who tries and take him 
   from me!&quot;, and storms out of his office. Jessica slowly becomes 
   more and more possessed (you can tell by her face, which looks like 
   an adult-possessed version of Linda Blair), as we watch her pick a 
   banana peel off the street and eat it (!) and she also sees Dimitri's 
   face in every window and mirror she looks into. Strange things begin 
   happening to Ken (who has still not opened the black-giftwrapped 
   present he received in the convertible earlier in the film) and Gail, 
   too, such as their stuffed toys moving of their own, just before 
   their bedroom goes into full <B><A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B> 
   mode, where the whole room shakes, bright lights emanate from under 
   the floor, dresser draws open and close in rapid succession, objects 
   fly through the air (including the gelatin dessert Gail brought into 
   the room to calm down Ken) and we hear the Devil laughing. When the 
   kids run to alert their mother in her bedroom, they witness Jessica's 
   head rotate 360 degrees, she having a devilish grin on her possessed 
   face. When Robert arrives home, Jessica accuses him of 
   &quot;smothering&quot; her (she said the same thing about the baby 
   earlier in the film) and the once-staid Gail (who was the voice of 
   reason in her family, even at her young age) is now scared shitless. 
   Robert storms out of the house (just before, he sees a human eyeball 
   in his drink!) and begins to walk San Francisco's steep streets 
   (where he is musically assaulted by the same band he bad-mouthed in 
   the beginning of the film!) and he is nearly run over by a truck as 
   he is crossing a street, but Dimitri pulls him back in the nick of 
   time. Dimitri wants Robert to listen to him about how to save 
   Jessica's life. He has only two Rules: <B>1.)</B> Jessica cannot 
   stray far from the house, and <B>2.)</B> No one can interfere with 
   Jessica's pregnancy. The child MUST be born. The questions we must 
   ask ourselves now are this: Is Dimitri a good guy or a bad guy? Is he 
   working in concert with the Devil or is he somehow trying to break 
   the deal he made with the Dark Lord? Those questions and more will be 
   answered in the film's extended finale, as it goes into full <B>EXORCIST</B> 
   mode, except there is no priest to perform an exorcism. It is just 
   Dimitri and the possessed Jessica, who begins spewing green goo out 
   of her mouth, swears worse than her daughter does, speaks in a deep 
   demonic voice <A HREF="beyond_the_door_1974_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beyond the door dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    floats and spins above her bed. The Devil commands that Dimitri 
   deliver the baby, saying, &quot;Plunge into her and whip it 
   out!&quot;, which is exactly what Dimitri does. The baby is born 
   without a mouth, so the Devil makes Ken his son. Dimitri soon learns 
   that even if you make a deal with the Devil, he will not abide by it. 
   The rather surprising and extremely good ending finds Ken opening the 
   black-giftwrapped present. What he finds inside and what he does with 
   it is very symbolic and unusually unique for a film like this. I'm 
   not going to tell you what happens, because this is something you 
   should experience for yourself.&nbsp; This is probably director 
   Ovidio G. Assontiis' (billed here as &quot;O. Hellman&quot;) best 
   film. He also directed the so-bad-it's-good <B><A HREF="tentacles_1977.htm">TENTACLES</A></B> 
   (1977) and the average thriller <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Madhouse">MADHOUSE</A></B> 
   (1981), among others. He is better known as a producer of genre 
   films, including <B><A HREF="super_stooges_vs_the_wonder_women_1975.htm">SUPER
    STOOGES VS. THE WONDER WOMEN</A></B> (1974), the extremely weird <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Visitor1978">THE
    VISITOR</A></B> (1978), <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Sonny Boy">SONNY

    II: THE BITE</A></B> (1989), and many, many more. The film lists the 
   mysterious Robert Barrett (billed simply as &quot;R. Barrett&quot;) 
   as co-director, something I find very questionable since it is also 
   the name of Jessica's husband in this film (Both Assonitis and 
   Barrett are listed a co-writers of the screenplay, too, along with 
   several other people, but on U.S. posters &amp; ad mats, Assonitis 
   gets sole directorial credit as &quot;Oliver Hellman&quot; and 
   Barrett gets sole screenplay credit.). He only has one other 
   directorial credit, a 1992 thriller called <B><A HREF="over_the_line_1992.htm">OVER
    THE LINE</A></B>, which was also co-directed by Assonitis. I think 
   it may be Assonitis' way of tricking the audience into believing that 
   he wasn't fully responsible for this film, but he has nothing to be 
   ashamed of here. <B><A HREF="beyond_the_door_1974b.htm">BEYOND THE DOOR</A></B> 
   is a great addition to the demonic possession genre, which has some 
   suprisingly literate scenes to go along with the scares. There's 
   George, who outfits Jessica with a straitjacket and has about fifty 
   electrodes attached to her head to try and find out what is wrong 
   with her. Basically Assonitis is comparing modern technology to 
   religion and questioning the audience of which way is the most 
   effective. There's also some unusual freeze-frame editing, which at 
   first I thought was a problem with the pressing of the DVD, but I 
   soon realized that it was an effective way of portraying various 
   stages of possession. All in all, this is a mesmerizing look at what 
   Satan will do to give himself a son and is the only film in my memory 
   that is narrated by him. Be on the lookout for a lithograph of Andy 
   Warhol's &quot;Campbell Soup Can&quot; painting in Ken &amp; Gail's 
   bedroom and an ad for Rice A Roni on the back of one of San 
   Francisco's cable cars (After all, it is &quot;The San Francisco 
   Treat&quot;!). Originally released on fullscreen VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Media Home Ent.">Media
    Home Entertainment</A>, with a budget VHS from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Budget Labels">Video
    Treasures</A> several years later. The two-disc DVD from Code Red is 
   a must for people who want to view this film the proper way, the same 
   way it looked in theaters overseas. The colors and picture are 
   near-perfect and I didn't notice any DNR or frames with emulsion 
   scratches or dirt. This is about as pristine as you are going to see 
   this film until its eventual Blu-Ray release (Code Red will release 
   it in late 2016). It also has running commentary by Assonitis, video 
   interviews with Assonitis, the late Richard Johnson (who passed away 
   on June 6, 2015) and Juliet Mills (who has aged very well), as well 
   as the creepy TV trailer that gave me nightmares over 40 years 
   previously. If you can find this DVD set, I would grab it, but before 
   you shell out big bucks for it (it is listed as being OOP), first

    CLUB</A><A NAME="BillyClub2014"></A> (2014) -</B> There are far too 
   few horror films about America's favorite pasttime: Baseball. I can 
   only think of a handfull of true horror films that deal with the 
   subject, like <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BloodGames1989">BLOOD GAMES</A></B> 
   (1989) and the truly awful <B><A HREF="catcher_1998.htm">THE CATCHER</A></B> 
   (1998). There have been plenty of thrillers and crime films that use 
   baseball as a major plot point, but not many true horror films. That 
   is, until now. This horror film is a true gorehound's delight and has 
   a pretty good story to go along with it, with an ending that will 
   take you by surprise. We see some unknown psycho watching a tape of a 
   Little League game, while he puts a wooden baseball bat in a vice. He 
   hammers huge nails through it and inserts a large retractable blade 
   at the tip. He then goes to the library to look at some microfiche 
   about a missing man in 1995, who was last seen stumbling out of a 
   tavern drunk as a skunk. We see the drunk guy pissing in an alley, 
   where the psycho, now dressed in an Umpire's uniform complete with 
   mask and deadly altered bat, chases the guy and pulls him from trying 
   to escape under a garage door. He splatters the man's brains with the nail-filled
    bat, burns a number into his flesh and then uses the blowtorch to 
   burn off his face on a team Little League photo. We then see the psycho<A HREF="billy_club_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/billy club dvd front9 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="281" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   use some chain pulley system in an underground room (it will be 
   explained later), while he goes outside and hits a baseball into a 
   lake, while we watch the ball sink to the bottom. We are now in Two 
   Rivers, Wisconsin (filmed on location) in 1996, as tomboy bartender 
   Alison McKenzie (Erin Hammond) notices a young man walk into the bar 
   and order a whiskey on the rocks. It turns out he is Alison's old 
   Little League teammate Bobby Spooner (Marshall Caswell) and they 
   haven't seen each other since they were kids when that unfortunate 
   &quot;accident&quot; happened. Bobby and Alison's old teammates (and 
   lifelong Two Rivers residents) Kyle (Nick Sommer) and Danny (Max 
   Williamson) soon join them at the bar. Both Kyle and Danny are 
   dressed in baseball uniforms because they just got done playing a 
   game in the local Adult League. They reminisce about the old days 
   while purposely avoiding the subject of the &quot;accident&quot;. The 
   three guys go to the local ballfield to play a game of hit and catch, 
   making fools of themselves, generally having fun and are soon joined 
   by Alison when she gets off duty. It's apparent that there is some 
   sexual heat between Bobby and Alison, but something hangs above all 
   their heads like a black cloud. None of the four want to talk about 
   it, but it eventually comes out. This is the 15 year anniversary when 
   something really bad happened and Allison mentions that they should 
   have a memorial this weekend for their childhood friends Sam and 
   Jamie, as well as their Coach Fredricks at the Coach's cabin in the 
   woods. But what actually happened to the three? Kyle has a flashback 
   to when he was a kid and he saw his three friends murdered by fellow 
   teammate Billy Haskins (Sebastian Weigman) at the ballfield in 1981, 
   while the police handcuff Billy and take him away (Billy shoved a 
   baseball bat down Coach Fredricks' throat and the other two victims 
   were left in bloody posed positions). The young Kyle screams out, 
   Fuck you, Billy! Fuck you!&quot; as the flashback ends. The Umpire 
   goes back to the library and pulls out some more microfiche, where he 
   reads newspaper stories about Billy Haskins and how he was committed 
   to a mental institution for his brutal murders. We see a bald Billy 
   in his hospital room, grotesque pictures drawn on the wall and he is 
   always crying. The Umpire calls a pizza delivery guy and has him 
   deliver it to the wrong address. Apparently, the pizza delivery guy 
   was also a teammate on that 1981 team, as the Umpire stands in the 
   middle of the road and the pizza guy gets a flat tire trying to avoid 
   him. While he is changing the tire, the Umpire sneaks up behind him 
   and stabs him in the back, the blade protruding out of his stomach, 
   by the homemade deadly baseball bat's retractable blade. He burns a 
   number on the pizza guy's skin (What could that possibly mean? The 
   numbers aren't in any discernible order.) and then uses the blowtorch 
   to burn his face out of the team photo (by the looks of it, the 
   Umpire has already claimed 6 victims). The problem is, none of the 
   victim's bodies are ever found. Our four friends head out to the 
   Coach's cabin, when they stop to play some miniature golf and hit 
   some balls at a batting cage. Danny sees an old guy slapping a young 
   boy behind a building and it triggers a flashback in Danny's mind, 
   where Coach Fredricks (Michael Stansy) is yelling at a young Billy 
   for not getting hit with a pitch and taking &quot;one for the 
   team&quot;. Seems like the Coach wasn't such a nice guy after all, 
   especially to Billy. After the flashback, they get into their vehicle 
   and head for the cabin, but someone is following them. Once at the 
   cabin, all four of them see the same team photo that the Umpire is 
   using to burn faces off and Alison has to remind Bobby that he gave 
   her her first kiss there (Bobby doesn't seem to remember). It just 
   happens to be Halloween. so the Umpire walking around in his get-up 
   does not raise any flags. The Umpire's next victim is a housewife 
   (and former 1981 Little League team member) handing out candy, when 
   the Umpire bashes her head in with the bat, burns the number 
   &quot;04&quot; on her chest and blow-torches her face off the team 
   photo. The four friends drive to the Coach's gravesite to pay tribute 
   to him, when they are stopped by a police officer and he ends up 
   hauling Bobby's ass in jail for alleged drunk driving (The officer 
   seems to know Bobby, but Bobby has no idea who he is). Danny walks 
   back to the cabin, while Alison and Kyle find the Coach's grave (they 
   first find a grave with the name &quot;Anita Mint&quot; engraved on 
   it!), but someone has removed his corpse from the grave. Kyle blames 
   Billy, but Alison says he should blame her (There is more to Billy's 
   story that we haven't been told yet.). The guy that was following 
   them enters the cabin carrying a shotgun, so Danny hides under one of 
   the beds. The mysterious man makes a phone call to tell the person 
   that hired him that they are not there right now, but &quot;someone's 
   gonna die&quot;, then hangs up the phone and leaves. Danny lights his 
   way under the bed with a Bic, where he sees strange drawings in the 
   underside of the bed, the same type of drawings we saw in Billy's 
   institution room. This could be interpreted as a prime example of 
   child abuse. Bobby is booked and is purposely put in a cell with a 
   crazy person who tries to kill him. What does this officer have 
   against him? Danny finds a bunch of chocolates in Alison's purse when 
   no one returns by daytime and eats them all. When Alison and Kyle 
   return to the cabin a short time later and Alison notices that all 
   the chocolates have been eaten, she freaks out. She tells Kyle that 
   they were &quot;boomers&quot;, or chocolate-<A HREF="billy_club_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/billy club poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>covered
    psychedelic mushrooms. A very high Danny cuts the chain to the shed 
   and steals a four-wheeled ATV and goes for a psychedelic joyride. 
   Kyle finds a gun in the truck's glove compartment. Danny has a 
   freak-out scene, which trips another flashback, where he sees Kyle, 
   Bobby and Alison shoving Billy behind the bleachers because he's not 
   a good ballplayer, telling him once again he &quot;screwed up&quot;. 
   Is it possible that Billy was being bullied by the four people we 
   have come to know and care about? Danny continues to trip-out and 
   finds an old school bus in the woods, where he has hallucinations of 
   people looking at him and saying he did nothing to stop them. Danny 
   then actually runs into the Umpire and he tries to get away on the 
   ATV, but he is so stoned, he clotheslines himself on a low-hanging 
   tree branch and is knocked off the ATV. Danny hops on the ATV to try 
   to escape again, but it's &quot;Batter up!&quot; as the Umpire 
   beheads Danny with one swing of his bat's blade. The Umpire burns the 
   number &quot;14&quot; on Danny's chest (it's at this time we learn 
   that the numbers burned on the chests correspond with the numbers on 
   their Little League uniforms) and burns his face off the team photo. 
   Want to know what happens to the other three, who the mysterious 
   stranger is and if Billy is actually the Umpire? Well, you'll have to 
   buy the DVD or watch it streaming. Either way, its a unique little 
   horror film about America's pasttime and the denouement comes as a 
   complete surprise for a film that looks like it is going to be the 
   usual DTV slasher film. It's very gory, Alison finally shows her 
   boobs and the story has a satisfying conclusion that nearly everyone 
   won't see coming. There are also other surprises revealed, especially 
   about Kyle and who the mysterious stranger really is. As a matter of

   role of the police officer who arrests Bobby) and Nick Sommer (his 
   first directorial effort; he plays Kyle in the film with a lot of 
   style) keeps the mystery coming and the blood flowing at a rapid pace 
   and the gore goes way past what the MPAA would consider R-Rated. All 
   I will tell you is that nearly everyone is not who they say they are 
   and we learn what the chain pulley system is used for when Alison 
   finds the underground room and accidentally trips it (it's not 
   pretty). I believe that this is the best baseball-themed horror film 
   I have ever seen and, even though it was made with a low budget, the 
   story is high concept. This should please most horror film fans, 
   especially those who were bullied when they were young. The killer's 
   sacrifice at the film's end is especially poignant and there are no 
   end credits stingers like most new DTV films. This is what most 
   horror films should hope to achieve: Give you a good mystery to go 
   along with the gory effects (and all of them here were physical). 
   This is not your typical DTV horror film. Also starring Mark Metcalf,

   military to grab objects from another dimension and bring them back 
   to ours. When Lisa accidentally grabs a creature (portrayed by Ray's

   Carter (William Fair) and Lisa track the monster through the desert, 
   as it begins killing citizens and dropping little face-hugging 
   creatures along the way. The rest of the film is just a series of 
   bloody monster attacks as throats are torn open, faces are ripped 
   apart or hugged and stomachs are used for incubation. There's also a 
   truly bizarre ending that's better seen than described.&nbsp; This is 
   nothing more than one of those countless little B movies that Fred 
   Olen Ray made in the 80's, although I like his earlier films more 
   than his later ones because he seemed to care more about the plots 
   and added some directorial flair. It seems that on his newer films, 
   he worries more about how to insert the cribbed footage of A-list 
   films he has licensed into his productions. His newer films seem 
   colder and don't have that absurd sense of humor (which this film 
   displays with a small bit with the creature and a poster of <B><A HREF="et_the_extra_terrestrial_1982.htm">E.T.</A></B>)
    his earlier films did. I get the sense he's doing it strictly now 
   for the money as he seems to have lost his fanboy mentality, which 
   shone so brightly even in his lousy early films (like <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Alien Dead">THE
    ALIEN DEAD</A></B> - 1979). Ray was also one of the few directors to 
   put washed-up and old-time actors in his cast, giving Aldo Ray and 
   Carroll Borland (<B><A HREF="mark_of_the_vampire_1935.htm">MARK OF 
   THE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1935) roles in this one. Although the monster 
   suit is shoddy (not to mention comically small), Ray throws in a lot 
   of bloody mayhem, some of it pretty well done. Angelique Pettyjohn (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MadDrBloodIsland69">MAD
    DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND</A></B> - 1968/1969) get a chance to show off 
   her giant mud flaps and there's other female nudity on view also. At 
   76 minutes, this film moves at a breezy clip and is not boring at 
   all, even if some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. When 
   viewed today, <B><A HREF="biohazard_1984c.htm">BIOHAZARD</A></B> may 
   seem derivative of countless <B>ALIEN</B> clones of the 80's. Just 
   remember that this was one of the first straight-to-video films to

   J.T. has problems of his own. His marriage has been in trouble since 
   his two year-old daughter died of leukemia a couple of years ago and 
   he hasn't written a positive review of a restaurant since. Peter 
   snaps (flashbacks show him as a child shoving a stick into his bully 
   older brother's neck [the blood sprays like a geyser] and then 
   burying the body without any future consequences) and kindaps J.T., 
   chaining him up in various places in his country home and challenging 
   him to taste the difference in foods based on the scathing reviews he 
   has written over the years. At one point, Peter puts two dishes in 
   front of J.T.; one dish contains cooked rabbit with blueberries and 
   the other contains the same thing but with a deadly dose of hemlock. 
   He has to pick a dish and finish it. Since he's a food critic, he 
   should be able to taste the difference, right? Wrong. J.T. is so 
   hungry (he eats with his hands) that he picks the wrong dish and 
   Peter watches the air slowly leave J.T.'s body before injecting him 
   with the antidote. He wants J.T. to suffer more, so Peter kidnaps

   this film's Producers), whom Katherine hired to look into her

   days at a time since the death of his daughter). Peter plans on

   DANGEROUS GAME</B></A> (1932) with J.T.. He gives him a three-minute 
   head start (Peter is a master huntsman) and sends J.T. into the 
   forest. This is just the time Katherine needs to find a piece of 
   glass and cut herself loose (One of the film's many obvious mistakes; 
   if he chains J.T., why not chain Katherine?). When she runs into 
   Peter outside, she shoves a stick into his neck (and the blood spurts

   (not that there are many) and not one of the characters is likable in 
   any way (even the wife). We should at least have someone to root for, 
   but everyone here is so impossible to care for (When Peter makes J.T. 
   walk for water carrying a bucket and tells him he cannot have any 
   until he gets back to the house [even though he is parched], you hope 
   he takes a drink before he gets home, just so we can see what Peter 
   does to him. When J.T. does just that, I was kind of happy because 
   J.T. is such a prick.) you won't care whether they live or die. If I 
   were Peter, the first person I would have kidnapped and killed would 
   be his female TV host. That would have made a much more enjoyable 
   film because she is a bitch of the highest order. As it stands, this 
   film offers little for the demanding horror film fan. Just a little 
   blood, a little nudity and a little story to go along with it. 
   Nothing special, but professionally made (using two high-definition digital<B> </B>Canon
    5D Mark II cameras). Just a small-budgeted film about a man who 
   snaps when someone ruins his life with the stroke of a keyboard. I 
   can sympathize, but the film should have been so much better. Also

    (Robert Frost) is given a black cat by his wife Diana (Robyn Baker) 
   for a first anniversary present. He names the cat Pluto and begins 
   showering it with attention, much to Diana's chagrin. Lou spends too 
   much time with Pluto, ignoring his wife's sexual needs and drinking 
   way too much. For their second anniversary, Lou comes home drunk, 
   tries to strangle Diana and cuts Pluto's right eye out with a 
   pocketknife after the cat scratches his hand. Lou begins to go 
   bonkers, pouring hot coffee on his pet monkey and imagining that 
   everyone in a bar is wearing a black patch over their right eye (a 
   very good scene featuring singer Scotty McKay and his band). He comes 
   home and electrocutes Pluto with a stripped electrical cord, 
   accidentally burning down the house. Finding out that he has no 
   insurance and is dead broke, he goes insane, tries to strangle his 
   lawyer and is committed to an insane asylum. After spending several 
   months in the asylum (where he begins to write a story called 
   &quot;The Black Cat&quot;), Lou is released into the loving arms of 
   Diana, &quot;cured&quot; of his alcoholism and insanity. Sure he is! 
   Almost immediately Lou begins hitting the bottle, calls a hooker in a 
   bar a &quot;witch&quot; (&quot;Just make sure you spell that with a 
   W.&quot; is her reply) and sees a black cat following him. He brings 
   the cat home and gives it to Diana, who notices it has a bad right 
   eye, &quot;just like Pluto.&quot; The cat begins to torment Lou as 
   his descent into madness begins to get the better of him. He buries 
   an axe into Diana's head (a very gory image that any true horror Baby 
   Boomer has seen, thanks to exposure in Famous Monsters and other 
   horror mags of the 60's) and walls her body up in the basement. The 
   housekeeper (Sadie French) calls the police and they search the house 
   looking for Diana. Lou is pretty sure he has the police fooled until 
   they hear a cat meowing behind the basement wall and break it down, 
   discovering Diana's decomposing body with the black cat resting on 
   her head. Lou escapes and leads the police on a high-speed chase, 
   where he loses his life after flipping his sports car trying to avoid 
   a black cat in the middle of the road. The last shot we see is Lou 
   lying lifeless amidst the wreck of his car, his right eye missing.

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with the POV of a cat following a man and then 
   sneaking into his car. As the man is driving, the black cat reveals 
   itself, forcing the man to crash his car, his head going through the 
   windshield as the car burns. The cat escapes the fiery inferno and 
   the opening credits begin (highlighting Pino Domaggio's [<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1978] evocative and effective music score [this 
   is his only Fulci film score]), as we follow the cat back to its 
   house, where we hear a woman scream. It's actually a tape recording 
   being played by Professor Robert Miles (Patrick Magee; <B><A HREF="tales_from_the_crypt_1972.htm">TALES
    FROM THE CRYPT</A></B> - 1972), a psychic medium who can talk to the 
   dead and records his sessions as proof he is not a fraud (and for 
   other reasons, made clear as the film progresses). We can see the cat 
   doesn't care for the Professor, as it scratches and bites his hand 
   when he reaches to pet it (Cats are very intuitive. Take it from a 
   cat lover!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see professional photographer Jill Trevers (Mimsy Farmer; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#FourFliesVelvet1971">FOUR

   (there are skeletons all over the place, one of them hanging by its 
   neck on a chain). She finds a small microphone on the dirt floor and 
   finds it strange to see something like that in a tomb, so she pockets 
   it. She then climbs out of the tomb, only to be greeted by new 
   friend, policeman Sgt. Wilson (&quot;Al Cliver&quot;; real name:

   very hospitable.&quot; Jill says she thought policemen weren't 
   superstitious and Sgt. Wilson replies, &quot;Perhaps in London they 
   aren't, but in a village like ours...&quot; Then he rides off on his 
   bicycle, wishing Jill a good day, not finishing his point (although 
   Jill clearly understands him and so do we). Jill yells to Sgt. Wilson 
   to show him the microphone she found in the tomb, but he is too far

   too crowded for them, so Stan takes her to a secluded boathouse, 
   where they can continue to get frisky. Maureen doesn't like the smell 
   of the room and Stan tells her it's okay, it's an airtight room used 
   for storing sails or something, what she is smelling is mildew 
   (&quot;Ohh, it's making me horny!&quot;, no one ever said!). Maureen 
   wants to leave, telling Stan that the room has no windows to open, 
   but he says not to worry, this room is air-conditioned! He then locks 
   the door from the inside and puts the key on a table, playfully 
   telling Maureen that she cannot escape from him now and no one will 
   bother them. Wanna bet? Stan takes off Maureen's blouse and begins 
   making love to her, not noticing that they are not alone, the cat is 
   in there with them. Suddenly, the electricity goes out and they both 
   panic when the key is no longer on the table, realizing that they 
   will no longer be able to breath shortly in this airtight room, the 
   air conditioner is no longer operational (I'm not sure this is how 
   air conditioning works!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Professor Miles in the cemetery, tape recorder in hand. 
   He walks up to the gravestone of some unknown man, puts the tape 
   recorder on the top of his tomb, complete with a microphone, the same 
   type Jill found in the open tomb. The Professor says, &quot;I'm 
   trying to reach you. I'm a friend. You can trust me. Speak to me, my 
   friend.&quot; Nothing immediately happens and when the Professor 
   turns around, the black cat is there, hissing and growling at him. 
   The tape recorder starts picking up voices (we can see the needle 
   moving on the recorder), but we cannot hear what is being said, as 
   only the Professor and the tape recorder can hear the voices of the 
   dead. A watchman (and town drunk), Ferguson (Bruno Corazzari; Fulci's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE

   and Sgt. Wilson rings her doorbell, telling her that there is no sign 
   of Maureen, the police have been looking for her all night and have 
   discovered that Stan is missing, too. Lillian wonders if they have 
   run off together and Sgt. Wilson says let's hope so. We then see a 
   shirtless Stan and a naked Maureen foaming at the mouth, moments away 
   from dying from a lack of oxygen. They hold each other's hand as the 
   flame on a candle extinguishes (I guess they didn't know that they 
   would have lived a little longer if they didn't light a candle!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A motorcycle speeds though this sleepy little village and when Sgt. 
   Wilson stops it for exceeding the speed limit, he discovers that 
   Scotland Yard Inspector Gorley (David Warbeck; Fulci's <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE

   investigate the disappearance of Maureen and Stan. When Inspector 
   Gorley notices the pretty Jill getting into her car, Sgt. Wilson 
   tells him that she's an American who has come here to take photos of 
   the ruins (Sgt. Wilson then hands a speeding ticket to a surprised 
   Inspector Gorley, asking him if he is going to pay it now or when he 
   leaves town! For those of you that think there is no humor in Fulci's 
   films, here's proof to the contrary.).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Jill is in the village pub, where she hears Ferguson tell some

   like to meet and talk to Professor Miles. Ferguson tells her it is 
   best if she doesn't because the Professor is &quot;a queer one&quot; 
   and a bit mad. We then see Jill at the Professor's house and she 
   hands him the microphone she found in the tomb, asking him if it is 
   his. He doesn't deny it, but he wants to know what she wants of him. 
   He then tells Jill about his special &quot;gifts&quot; and how stupid 
   the townspeople are, their ignorance make him look like a &quot;bloody
    grave robber.&quot; He tells Jill that death is not the end of 
   everything and his special powers prove that it's &quot;just the 
   beginning of a new journey.&quot; He needs to talk to dead people to 
   understand what that journey is. Jill asks him what he is going to do 
   when he finds out and the Professor replies that he's not sure, but 
   he knows the power of the senses; what it means to see, hear and 
   touch, asking Jill why must his mind be limited to just that? Can it 
   not reach out for something else? (That's a very good question; one 
   that is not usually asked. An adult mind doesn't ask such questions, 
   but children usually do, which is why we lose our 
   &quot;innocence&quot; when we become adults.). Jill says there are 
   limits, barriers to such knowledge (See what I mean?) and the 
   Professor disagrees, saying, &quot;We set up 'those' barriers in self 
   defense.&quot; Jill tells the Professor that he frightens her and a 
   sly smile forms on his face as he says, &quot;Do I? Oh, I'd be very 
   disappointed if I thought you were superstitious.&quot; Jill replies, 
   &quot;No, I'm just afraid you won't know when to stop.&quot; The 
   Professor uses his powers to put Jill in a trance-like state. This 
   may be the creepiest sequence in the film, help exponentially by 
   Magee's expressive face and piercing eyes, as he tells Jill he could 
   command her to do anything he wants and she will have no power to 
   resist; she won't even remember what she did. The cat then attacks 
   the Professor, using its claws to put deep, bloody gashes into the 
   palms of his hands, which snaps Jill out of the trance. Jill then 
   asks him why he keeps such a nasty cat (she has no idea she was under 
   his &quot;spell&quot;) and the Professor replies, &quot;We need each 
   other.&quot; He tells Jill not to try and understand, he and the cat 
   are bound together by hatred and the cat wants to kill him. Will it succeed?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the cat kill a drunk Ferguson by chasing him into a 
   building (the cat has the uncanny ability to be in two or more places 
   at the same time) and knocking him off the floorboards of the attic, 
   where he is impaled on metal rods protruding out of the cement 
   foundation below. The Inspector asks Jill to take photos of 
   Ferguson's crime scene (this small village doesn't have a police 
   photographer; they never needed one before) and she notices the same 
   cat gashes are on Ferguson's hand as those on the Professor. Lillian 
   goes to the Professor and asks him to use his powers to locate her 
   daughter. He asks for a personal item belonging to Maureen and he and 
   Lillian then have a s&eacute;ance, where he says, &quot;The key! You 
   must find the key!&quot; Lillian then knows where her daughter is and 
   when the Inspector opens the door to the boathouse (Lillian finds the 
   key behind the boathouse), Lillian sees Maureen's corpse being eaten 
   by a pack of rats. The Inspector phones the Professor and asks him to 
   come to the crime scene, where he notices the cat's paw prints 
   leading to the air conditioner. He now knows (as does Jill) that the 
   cat is responsible for the murders in the village, but he fails to 
   mention that to the Inspector.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The cat sets Lillian's home on fire by knock over an oil lamp next 
   to a roaring fire in the fireplace, setting Lillian's nightgown 
   aflame, killing her when she falls out a window to the pavement 
   below. The Professor drugs the cat's food and watches it eat it. He 
   hangs the cat by the neck with a makeshift noose tied to a tree 
   branch and we watch the cat die (in silhouette, its dying shadow 
   projected on a wall). At the same time, Jill is awoken from a sound 
   sleep when her bed begins levitating and bouncing on the floor. The 
   cat haunts both Jill and the Professor, as they see its silhouette 
   projected on walls. Jill tells the Inspector that the cat is the 
   killer (&quot;Not cats. A cat!&quot;), but she believes the Professor 
   is using his powers to make the cat kill. The Inspector finds it hard 
   to believe, but it doesn't stop him from starting a romance with 
   Jill! Alas, that romance will be short-lived, for, as he is walking 
   down the street late that night, the cat attacks him (once again 
   appearing in two or more places at the same time), clawing at his 
   face until it is a bloody mess. He goes into some type of hypnotic 
   spell (the same way Jill did) until he is hit and seriously wounded 
   by a passing car (We are led to believe he is dead until a short time 
   before the film concludes).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jill's suspicions about the Professor get the better of her and she 
   begins to follow him, which leads to an important discovery in the 
   Professor's house, which explains why all the murders are happening. 
   Jill holds the cat at bay with the flash on her camera, that is until 
   the battery dies and the Professor catches her. He tells her, 
   &quot;Cats take orders from no one.&quot; The cat is an 
   &quot;instrument&quot; of his, using it to get even with the 
   townspeople who forced him into a life of isolation (He wouldn't have 
   to live this way if he had just stopped visiting the cemetery at 
   night!). Jill ends up missing and a recovering Inspector Gorley goes 
   searching for her, ending up in the Professor's house. Just as with 
   the ending of Poe's story, the wails of a cat leads the police to the 
   Professor's basement, where he walled-in an unconscious Jill (and the 
   cat) with bricks.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is not the usual Fulci gorefest, but that's not to say that 
   there aren't some bloody deaths in this film. The flick is more 
   interested in the Gothic supernatural angle, as the screenplay, 
   written by Fulci and Biagio Proietti (<B><A HREF="death_occurred_last_night_1970.htm">DEATH
    OCCURRED LAST NIGHT</A></B> - 1970; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerReserved9Seat">THE

   Professor Miles, adding a very creepy vibe to his gifts, helped by 
   Patrick Magee's manic performance. This is one of the few times I 
   advise you watch the English dubbed version, as the Italian version 
   has someone else dubbing Magee's voice, which he supplies in the 
   English dubbed version. Magee's voice (and unkempt eyebrows!) is 
   needed to fully appreciate his performance, in which he does seem a 
   little crazy in his ambitions, walking to tombs and talking to the 
   dead people inside, who talk back to him. He is so disgusted with the 
   townspeople that he takes control of the cat's mind (another one of 
   his &quot;gifts&quot;) to kill the people that look upon him as a 
   grave robber, forcing him to live alone with the feline until the cat 
   can take no more and turns against him (Hey, even cats have 
   consciences!). The cat POV shots are very good and fluid 
   (cinematography by Sergio Salvati; Fulci's <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#Four Apocalypse1975">THE

    this film was as a favor to producers Giulio Sbarigia (<B><A HREF="salon_kitty_1976.htm">SALON

   fare, it's nothing to be ashamed of, either. It's a compact horror 
   film with enough good performances to be recommended. Some of the 
   problems I do have with this film are obvious, such as the 
   &quot;airtight&quot; boathouse. I never heard of such a thing before 
   and it is only in this film purely for the shock element. Some of the 
   dialogue is also risible. But those are only minor quibbles. You may 
   also notice that the scene where Jill is attacked by bats is 
   remarkably similar to a scene in Fulci's <B><A HREF="house_by_the_cemetery_1982.htm">HOUSE
    BY THE CEMETERY</A></B> (1981), made shortly after this film. When I 
   first saw this in a theater in 1982, I would have given you a whole 
   different, negative opinion about the film, but you can chalk that up 
   to a young mind expecting a gorefest and being bitterly disappointed 
   (It was one of the only Fulci horror films to be released in the U.S. 
   without any gore violence cuts or being released to theaters without 
   a rating by the MPAA, as many of his early-'80s films were). Getting 
   older has its positive moments, too, especially when it comes to 
   watching films.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1972) -</B> Ah, the good old 70's. A decade that allowed every genre 
   of exploitation film to get a chance to shine. One of the rarest of 
   the exploitation sub-genres was the blaxploitation horror film, some 
   of which gave a new spin to the classic 30's horror films. Dracula 
   became <B><A HREF="blacula_1972.htm">BLACULA</A></B> (1972), Dr.

    BLACK MR. HYDE</A></B> (1975) and Frankenstein became this, the 
   barely-released and little-seen runt of the litter. There's a reason 
   for that. Dr. Winifred Walker (Ivory Stone) moves to L.A. to take a 
   job with Nobel Prize-winning Dr. Stein (John Hart) and to be close to 
   her bedridden boyfriend Eddie Turner (Joe De Sue), a Vietnam veteran 
   who lost<A HREF="blackenstein_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blackenstein dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   both arms and legs when he stepped on a landmine. Dr. Stein is the 
   leading authority on limb transplants, so Winifred has Eddie moved 
   from the Veterans Hospital (where he is abused by a male orderly, who 
   gives a long, rambling speech mocking Eddie's &quot;patriotism&quot;) 
   to Dr. Stein's castle laboratory, where we are introduced to Dr. 
   Stein's other patients: Eleanor (Andrea King), an elderly patient who 
   is getting progressively younger thanks to Dr. Stein's daily 
   injections of his new, yet not perfected, DNA formula and Bruno (Nick 
   Bolin), a patient who recently had a new leg attached to his body 
   (also using the DNA formula). Dr. Stein and Winifred perform a 
   quadruple transplant on Eddie, giving him new arms and legs using the 
   DNA formula to stop Eddie's body from rejecting the limbs. At first, 
   everything seems to go swimmingly, as Eddie can move his fingers and 
   toes, but when Dr. Steins lumbering black assistant, Malcomb 
   (Roosevelt Jackson), professes his love for Winifred and she turns 
   him down (&quot;I think it's best we just stay friends.&quot;), he 
   fucks around with Eddie's final DNA injection, which turns him into a 
   foot-shuffling, violent monster: Blackenstein! Blackie breaks free 
   and begins a murder spree, killing the abusive V.A. hospital orderly, 
   a prostitute and her john and a rapist and his victim, before 
   returning to Dr. Stein's castle, just in time to catch Malcomb trying 
   to rape Winifred. After killing Malcomb, Eleanor, Bruno and, finally, 
   Dr. Stein, Blackie leaves the castle, chases and kills one final 
   victim before he is killed in a most unothodox manner. Winifred 
   faints into the arms of a black detective and the film mercifully 
   ends.&nbsp; This cheap horror flick, the first directorial effort by 
   William A. Levey (<B><A HREF="wham_bam_thank_you_spaceman_1975.htm">WHAM

   - 1989) and one-time producer/scripter Frank R. Saletri, barely got a 
   theatrical release and it's easy to see why. It's deadly slow and 
   nothing much happens for the film's first fifty minutes. Thanks to 
   home video, viewers can fast-forward to watch the gory killings in 
   the final thirty minutes, but for theater goers this must have been 
   pretty yawn-inducing. The first murder (the V.A. hospital orderly) is 
   shown only as shadows against a hospital bed curtain and contains one 
   of the worst arm-rippings in recent memory (there is a quick shot of 
   the orderly's bloody stump afterwards, though) and Liz Renay (<B><A HREF="thrill_killers_1965.htm">THE
    THRILL KILLERS</A></B> - 1965) puts in a cameo as Blackenstein's 
   third victim, who gets eviscerated by Blackie's hands and has <A HREF="black_frankenstein_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black frankenstein aka blackenstein poster small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>her
    intestines fondled. There's also a groan-inducing black comedian 
   (Andy &quot;Z&quot;) in a cabaret who tells an awful talking dog joke 
   before introducing singer Cardella DeMilo, who sings a tune entitled 
   &quot;Thankful&quot;, while we watch Blackie snap the neck of a 
   rapist and then play with the disemboweled internal organs of a 
   topless female victim. There's not much to recommend here, as the 
   editing is atrocious, the music soundtrack is mostly library cues and 
   the acting is simply horrid (John Hart and Andrea King are the only 
   cast members that had extensive film credits). The only plus here is 
   Dr. Stein's laboratory. They had the good sense to hire Kenneth 
   Strickfadden, who supplied the electrical lab equipment that he used 
   for the 1931 classic <B><A HREF="frankenstein_1932.htm">FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> 
   to this film and, while the laboratory shots are filmed with some eye 
   for shadow and detail, but I doubt anyone would want to watch this 
   simply for that reason. The film loses all sense of continuity after 
   Eddie becomes the monster. It's as if Levey gave up hope on making a 
   rational film, as scenes start in mid-sentence, the time frame makes 
   no sense (shots go from night to day back to night again) and the 
   introduction of a white female victim (Dale Bach) in the finale 
   (used, I think, to pad the film's running time) reeks of desperation. 
   The death of Blackie (he's torn to death by a pack of police 
   dobermans!) is a total letdown. No people with torches, no big fire 
   in the laboratory, just Blackie lying on the ground with his stomach 
   ripped out. <B><A HREF="blackenstein_1972b.htm">BLACKENSTEIN</A></B>

    familiar with this title from TV's <B>BLACK BELT THEATER</B> in the 
   80's, this version will be a revelation, since it restores all the 
   sex, gore and violence missing from the TV version and plays like a 
   totally different film. A woman named Lo Yin (Tammy Tien Ni) goes to 
   a sorcerer to put a death spell on her husband and his mistress. We 
   then watch the gory details, as the sorcerer prepares the spell (He 
   cuts the flesh off a corpse's stomach and then removes the corpse's 
   head, putting the flesh and the head over an open fire while he 
   chants and we watch the body parts roast). The sorcerer grabs two wax 
   dolls (one has an erect penis) and he joins them together in the 
   missionary position. He then pierces the wax dolls with numerous 
   needles as we watch the naked bodies of the actual husband and his 
   mistress writhe in agony and die. When their bodies are found the 
   next morning, a priest chants over their corpses, which causes the 
   evil sorcerer to slice his tongue with a knife, have his face burnt 
   with a mysterious red light and his house collapses and is destroyed. 
   The now-wealthy Lo Yin sets her sights on handsome young lad Hsu Lo 
   (Ti Lung), even though she knows he's engaged to be married to Wang 
   Chu-ying (Lily Li). A gigolo (Lo Leih), after Lo Yin's money, goes to 
   wizard San Kan-mi (Ku Feng) for a love spell and watches in the 
   shadows as the wizard prepares a love spell for a naked woman (He 
   covers her vagina with white rice, squirts milk out of her breast 
   into a bowl, mixes it with snake venom, soaks the vagina rice with 
   the mixture, shapes the rice into a ball and tells the woman that her 
   boyfriend has to eat the rice for everlasting love to her). The 
   gigolo agrees to pay San Kan-mi a gold bar for his services, but 
   first the gigolo must bring the wizard some of Lo Yin's hair and her 
   footprints in mud (!). He does and the wizard creates the love powder 
   and a mud effigy of Lo Yin. The gigolo puts the powder in one of Lo 
   Yin's drinks at a cocktail party and she falls madly in love with 
   him, but a freak accident (involving the mud effigy) breaks the spell 
   and Lo Yin forces the gigolo to tell her about the love spell. Lo Yin 
   uses the gigolo and San Kan-mi to her advantage and has the wizard 
   create a love spell <A HREF="black_magic_1975b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black magic-orphan ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="234" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(&quot;Guaranteed
    to last a minimum of one year.&quot;) which she plans to use on Hsu 
   Lo, but first she must collect some of Hsu's hair and blood, produce 
   milk from her breasts (the wizard makes her swallow a potion to make 
   this happen) and hide a human finger and teeth under Hsu's bed. Once 
   the spell is completed, Lo Yin uses the potion at Hsu's marriage 
   ceremony to Wang Chu-ying and Hsu walks away hand-in-hand with Lo Yin 
   in the middle of the wedding reception. Needless to say, Wang 
   Chu-ying is not going to take this lying down and since the spell can 
   only be broken if San Kan-mi dies, a good sorcerer is brought in to 
   do battle. Wang Chu-ying has a death spell put on her and only has 
   three days to live. Is there enough time left for both spells to be 
   broken and the newlyweds to live happily ever after? Expect some double-crosses

   opens with a bunch of topless women (all nudity was cut from the 
   edited version) splashing around in a river when, all of a sudden, a 
   huge crocodile grabs one of them and chows down on her. An elderly 
   white-haired witch doctor hangs a live chicken on a hook above the 
   river and begins chanting. The crocodile grabs the chicken and 
   becomes hooked, as the witch doctor pulls it to shore and stabs it in 
   the eyes, finishing the crocodile off by gutting it and pulling the 
   contents out of it's stomach, which includes a tin can, a sandal and 
   the unfortunate dead girl's bracelet, which he hands over to her 
   family. We then switch to two professional city couples, who take a 
   trip to &quot;a tropical city&quot; to research spells and to 
   discover if they have any validity in modern society. Something tells 
   me that they're not going to like what they uncover. They stop at a 
   nightclub (a disco band plays a funky tune while a girl in a sequined 
   bikini dances on-stage), where we watch an evil black magician (Lo 
   Lieh; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#StrangerGunfight74">THE 
   STRANGER AND THE GUNFIGHTER</A></B> - 1974) bring a beautiful woman 
   back to his mansion, leads her into a secret room, strips her naked 
   and then reveals that she has a giant spike embedded in the top of 
   her skull! He slowly pulls the spike out with a pair of pliers and 
   the beautiful girl rapidly turns into a decaying corpse. The two 
   couples, the male members both being doctors, visit a hospital where 
   the patients have strange skin ulcers, all said to have been caused 
   by spells, especially the dreaded &quot;Green Venom Poison 
   Spell&quot;, which causes lesions that look like human faces. The 
   black magician becomes smitten with Margaret (Tanny; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#HumanLanterns">HUMAN
    LANTERNS</A></B> - 1982), the wife of one of the doctors, and puts a 
   spell on her by stealing a drop of her blood, hanging a dead cat in 
   her yard and pouring a potion made from her blood on one of his huge 
   collections of wax effigies. Margaret's husband, Zhensheng (Ti Lung; <B><A HREF="10_tigers_of_kwang_tung_1980.htm">10

   control of the black magician, who creates a potion using her 
   freshly-shaven pubic hair (!), to make Margaret produce breast milk, 
   which he will drink every night to keep his youthful appearance. 
   Every night, Margaret sleepwalks to his mansion, where he sucks on 
   her titties and then makes love to her (including some backdoor

    that she is suddenly nine months pregnant! She has an emergency 
   c-section, where a mutated stillborn baby is delivered. Folks, this 
   is only the first thirty minutes of the film. What comes next is 
   truly beyond proper description and is best witnessed first 
   hand.&nbsp; This is another weird and entertaining Shaw Brothers 
   production, directed by demented genius Ho Meng-Hua (credited as 
   &quot;Horace Mengwa&quot; on the abortive English language prints), 
   who also directed the original <B><A HREF="#BlackMagic1975">BLACK MAGIC</A></B>

    KILLER SNAKES</A></B> - 1974), gets increasingly more bizarre as the 
   film progresses, as we watch the black magician (whose name is 
   revealed as Kang Cong!) perform his various spells (usually love 
   spells for some poor schmucks that invariably go very, very wrong) 
   obtaining blood or a personal item from his victims, which he uses to 
   make potions to pour over his wax dolls or on the many dead, rotting 
   corpses he keeps in the basement of his mansion. He then hammers a 
   giant spike into the tops of their heads and, presto!, instant zombie 
   with a youthful appearance. There's so much more insanity on view, 
   including grave robbing, dead cat whipping, breast milk squirting, 
   stop-motion disintegrations, skin lesions containing slimy worms and 
   a zombie attack in the finale that is as surreal as it is horrific. 
   There's also the prerequisite battle between the good magician (the 
   white-haired witch doctor from the beginning of the film) and the 
   black magician, where the black magician drives giant nails into his 
   own cheeks and hands while the good magician rips out his own eyes 
   and gives them to the hero for protection! I won't even mention the 
   fight on a moving tram car that offers some of the chintziest blue 
   screen work in recent memory. There's also tons of nudity and sex on 
   view, all of it missing from the English language version; so much 
   so, that it plays like an entirely different film. This is twisted 
   horror in the best sense and gets my highest recommendation. A second

    MAMBA</A><A NAME="BlackMamba"></A> (1974) -</B> This weird, 
   little-seen Philippines-lensed horror film opens in a fog-shrouded 
   graveyard, where we see a hunchback ghoul break into a crypt and cart 
   off a body after stealing an unusual gold ring off the corpse's 
   finger. As he is dragging the body through the graveyard, he is 
   startled by the sudden appearance of a witch (Marlene Clark) dressed 
   in black and he runs away. The ring ends up in a jewelry store and we 
   see the witch purchase it. While in church, Elena (Pilar Pilapil) 
   notices the ring on the witch's finger and has words with her 
   outside. The ring belonged to Elena's dead husband and he was buried 
   with it, so she wants to know why the witch is wearing it now. The 
   witch turns and walks away and, in flashbacks, we learn that the 
   witch was having an affair with Elena's husband a short time before 
   he died. Elena and her young son Michael (Steve Maniquiz) now live 
   with her sister Barbara (Rosemary Gil) and her husband Fred (Filipino 
   stalwart Eddie Garcia). Fred wants a child of his own, but Barbara is 
   incapable of having any (He tells Elena, &quot;She's as barren as the 
   Sahara!&quot;), so he looks at Michael as his own son. The strain it 
   is having on Fred and Barbara's marriage is highly evident.

   is found dead in the graveyard (the witch frightens him to death by 
   putting a vision in his head that the body he is stealing has come 
   back to life), the police ask kindly town doctor Paul Morgan (John 
   Ashley) to perform an autopsy to find the cause of death. Paul is 
   also treating the jewelry store shopkeeper (Alfonso Cavajal), who is 
   having visions of the Grim Reaper (complete with scythe), since the 
   witch put a spell on him for buying the ring from the hunchback. The 
   witch makes a wax effigy of the shopkeeper and gives him a heart 
   attack, killing him. Paul and Elena are having a picnic on the beach 
   and a black bird steals Elena's handkerchief. The witch uses the 
   hankerchief in one of her rituals (also including a wax doll) to give 
   Elena severe headaches, forcing Elena to pass out at a bus stop. The 
   witch weasels herself into Paul's life, but when the shopkeeper is 
   finally found dead in his home nine days later, a thief is killed 
   after jumping through the jewelry store window and Elena is seriously 
   hurt and ends up in the hospital, Paul has to put aside his 
   &quot;logical explanations&quot; and learn to fight the unknown with 
   magic. When little Michael gets caught in the middle of this mess, 
   good will have to fight evil (including using a medicine man , who 
   tries to whip the evil out of Elena) in the ultimate battle of 
   power.&nbsp; Since this film never got a legitimate release in the 
   United States until recently, it's not as well known as some other 
   Filipino horror films made around the same time, like <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightCobraWoman">NIGHT

   role similar to the one she plays here) or the many horror and action

   a.k.a. <B><A HREF="fatal_mission_1989.htm">FATAL MISSION</A></B> - 
   1989) keeps the bloodshed and carnage to a minimum, relying on the 
   supernatural elements, like voodoo ceremonies, visions and graveyard 
   fog to convey a mood of dread. There is one gruesome scene where a 
   coroner performs an autopsy on the shopkeeper's body, where he 
   removes and cuts into the heart and extracts the brain using a 
   bonesaw (after peeling back the scalp), but this sequence seems to 
   have been inserted strictly for shock value (some say it's real 
   autopsy footage) as it's out-of-place with the rest of the film. The 
   screenplay (by Carl Kuntze) tries to find a parallel between modern 
   medicine and ancient beliefs in witchcraft and how they both can be 
   accepted as legitimate science. While there is no nudity in this 
   film, a snake does crawl between Elena's legs and enters her snatch 
   and, if I'm not mistaken, Old Scratch makes an appearance during a 
   ritual involving dancing girls dressed in red (It is his favorite 
   color after all!). There is also an exorcism (<B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE
    EXORCIST</A></B> was new and novel at the time) and, if you ever 
   wanted to see John Ashley deliver a baby, pick it up with one hand 
   and slap it on the ass, then this is the film for you. Some may find 
   this too dull and&nbsp; soap opera-like to sustain interest. It's 
   rarity makes it worth at least one look in my book. Also starring 
   Willie Nepomuceno (as the hunchback), Laurice Guillen, Antonio 
   Carrion and Andres Centenera. Is it just me or does John Ashley seem 
   to sleepwalk through his role here? The print I viewed looks like a 
   dub taken from a worn, soft-looking 16mm print with some noisy and 
   scratchy sound problems. It's watchable, though. Now available on DVD

   emailed CritCon with this juicy bit of behind-the-scenes information: <B>&quot;The
    making of BLACK MAMBA was more interesting than how the movie turned 
   out. The autopsy was supposed to be conducted by a certified 
   pathologist, who hadn't shown up as promised. A Filipino morgue 
   attendant volunteered. &quot;I will be the one. I know how.&quot; He 
   didn't even have proper instruments. When the doctor showed up five 
   hours after the filming was over, he was shocked at the condition of 
   the body. It was completely mangled. It had to be buried in a sealed 
   coffin. The relatives of the corpse, who was convict</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">ed</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B> 
   of capital crimes, had consented to the autopsy for the money to bury 
   him. Had they seen the body, they might have committed some mangling 
   themselves. John Ashley and most of the production crew were puking 
   their guts out. I reshot the autopsy using a pig's brain and 
   entrails. The skull was reconstructed from ceramics by an artist. A 
   reviewer complimented the protocol. The producer himself used a 
   surgical saw. I intended to rewrite it according to the original 
   premise: Santeria (Palo Mayombe). I didn't have a devil worship 
   scene, and my doctor was not in The Peace Corps. He was an 
   incompetent hiding his failings in a small town. John Ashley did his 
   best acting in this movie. He should have taken it more seriously.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT></P>

   re-cutting scenes in one episode to eliminate the lesbian overtones 
   (thinking that American audiences wouldn't understand or protest.

    The first episode, &quot;The Drop Of Water&quot; (my favorite of the 
   trio), gets things started, when nurse Helen (Jacqueline Pierreaux) 
   gets a phone call from a maid (Milly Monti) in the middle of the 
   night, telling her that the woman of the house, a medium, has died 
   and she needs to come over immediately to dress her body and prepare 
   her for the undertaker. When Helen gets there, she discovers that the 
   medium has died with a <A HREF="black_sabbath_1963_dead_medium_photo.htm">terrified
    expression on her face</A> (still creepy today), the maid telling 
   her that the spirits of the dead killed her when she was holding a 
   spiritual s&eacute;ance. When the maid leaves the room (the house is 
   crawling with cats), Helen can't help herself and takes an 
   expensive-looking ring off the medium's right index finger, knocking 
   over a glass of water on the night table in the process. Helen tries 
   to hide the fact that she took the ring by dressing the medium and 
   placing her left hand over her right, as most bodies as posed in 
   their coffins, but the medium's hands keep moving and a big horsefly 
   keeps landing on the medium's right index finger, drawing attention 
   to the missing ring, no matter how many times Helen shoos it away. 
   Helen also closes the medium's eyes, but every time she turns around, 
   her eyes are open again, as if she is watching her (There's also a 
   lamp in the other room that seems to lower itself down from the 
   ceiling, as if invisible hands were pulling it down). Both Helen and 
   the maid then leave the house (the maid is too creeped-out to stay 
   there) and Helen goes home and admires the stolen ring, putting it on 
   her left ring finger, but the same (?) horsefly keeps landing on her 
   ring finger, as if to say it knows she stole it. Helen then starts 
   hearing water dripping and when she checks all her faucets, she 
   discovers the bathtub faucet is dripping and turns it off (Back at 
   the medium's house a short time earlier, Helen hears water dripping 
   in the medium's bedroom, so she rights the fallen water glass and it 
   stops). Helen then hears more dripping noises, only louder, and 
   discovers it is coming from her umbrella, which she used coming back 
   from the medium's house in the pouring rain. She shakes the water 
   from the umbrella, but it is plain to see that Helen is a nervous 
   wreck. She then hears more water dripping, this time very loud and 
   her bathroom door keeps slamming by itself, but Helen discovers a 
   window open in the bathroom, the wind from the storm blowing rain 
   into the room and moving the door, but when the lights suddenly go 
   out, Helen starts to go mad. She lights a candle and hears dogs 
   howling and when she enters her bedroom, she discovers the dead body 
   of the medium is lying on her bed, the same creepy expression on her 
   face, looking at Helen as if to say, &quot;I know what you did!&quot; 
   The medium's body rises from the bed and no matter where Helen turns, 
   the body is there. The body starts floating slowly towards Helen and 
   it looks as if the medium is choking Helen. The next morning, the 
   police arrive at Helen's apartment, sent there by a neighbor who 
   heard Helen screaming over and over. They find Helen dead, lying on 
   the floor with her own hands around her neck, no ring on her finger, 
   just a small bloody cut on her left ring finger, as if someone pulled 
   a ring violently off her finger. The look on Helen's face? The 
   coroner says it looks like she was frightened to death, as if 
   &quot;she's seen something too horrible to live through.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next tale, &quot;The Telephone&quot; (the episode that received 
   the most tampering by A.I.P.), concerns itself with pretty young call 
   girl Rosy (Michele Mercier; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WebSpider1971">WEB
    OF THE SPIDER</A></B> - 1971), who keeps getting a series of hang-up 
   phone calls as she is getting ready for bed. The next phone call has 
   a man on the other end, who tells her he can see what she is wearing 
   and that she has a body that can &quot;drive somebody crazy.&quot; He 
   then hangs up and Rosy closes all the blinds on her windows. He calls 
   again, asking her why she changed her clothes, as if he can still see 
   her. She asks the man what she wants and he says, &quot;Everything. 
   Everything of what you have, but for now I just want you to take off 
   that dressing gown. I want to watch you, embrace you with my 
   eyes.&quot; Rosy is understandable shaken up, but she makes sure all 
   the door and windows are locked and even covers the keyholes so no 
   one can peep in. She also hides all her jewelry and money. The man 
   calls again, telling her he saw her hiding her valuables, saying, 
   &quot;You always thought money was the answer. It won't help you. 
   Nothing can help you because I want that beautiful body of yours. We 
   will be together...soon!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Rosy can't take any more, asking the man who he is, but he hangs up, 
   Rosy crying her eyes out. We then see a pair of eyes peering at Rosy 
   through the slats of one of her window blinds, who then slides an 
   envelope under her front door. She opens the envelope and sees 
   invisible hands writing &quot;There's no way of avoiding it Rosy - it 
   won't be long now! Frank&quot; The phone then rings again and the man 
   tells her he is very near and he will get her before the police 
   arrive. Rosy yells out, &quot;This can't be Frank! Frank is 
   dead!&quot; Rosy calls her friend Mary (Lydia Alfonsi; <B><A HREF="hercules_1958.htm">HERCULES</A></B> 
   - 1958) and tells her Frank is calling her, but a disbelieving Mary

   up Mary to be with her, but she turned him in, so she will be dead 
   before dawn. Mary arrives an tells Rosy it was probably a crank call 
   because Frank is dead, so in the morning she will take her to the 
   police, but Mary slides a large knife under a pillow on Rosy's bed, 
   just to be safe (In the original version, Rosy and Mary are lesbian 
   lovers). Mary puts a tranquilizer in Rosy's nightly glass of tea and 
   we watch Mary write Rosy a note, telling her she gave her a 
   tranquilizer to give her time to find her a psychiatrist to talk to, 
   because she is acting crazy. We then see a man silently entering 
   Rosy's apartment, taking a pair of Rosy's nylons and sneaking up on 
   Mary as she is writing the note, strangling her with the stockings. A 
   groggy Rosy hears Mary's screams and we see Frank (Milo Quesada; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_blood_monster_1970.htm">NIGHT

    The third and final (as well as the longest) episode, &quot;The 
   Wurdulak&quot; is probably the episode that gets the most press, as 
   it is Gothic horror at its finest. It concerns a young nobleman, 
   Vladimir D'Urfe (Mark Damon; <B><A HREF="#Crypt of Living Dea">CRYPT 
   OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1973), returning a dagger he found in 
   the back of a headless Turkish bandit, bringing it to the castle of 
   Count Gregor (Glauco Oronato; <B><A HREF="magnificent_dare_devil_1973.htm">THE
    MAGNIFICENT DARE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973). When Vladimir shows Gregor 
   where he found the dagger, a passing townsperson tells them that the 
   headless Turkish bandit was a Wurdulak, or a vampire that survives by 
   drinking the blood of loved ones, turning them into Wurdulaks in the 
   process. Gregor's sister, Sdenka (Susy Andersen; <B><A HREF="killers_are_challenged_1966.htm">KILLERS
    ARE CHALLENGED</A></B> - 1966), begs Vladimir to kill her before the 
   night is over, because she is to become a Wurdulak tonight. Vladimir 
   doesn't believe in such nonsense, that is until he meets Gregor's 
   father, Gorca (Boris Karloff), the Lord and owner of the castle, who 
   has been in the woods for five days, supposedly hunting the Turkish 
   bandit, but five days is also the time it takes to turn into a 
   Wurdulak once bitten. Even Gorca's dog doesn't recognize him, barking 
   and howling uncontrollably when he steps into the castle. He orders 
   Gregor to kill the dog, which he does. We discover that Gorca was 
   bitten by the Turkish bandit and Gorca has the bandit's severed head 
   in a bag (the only true way to kill a Wurdulak), ordering his other 
   son, Pietro (Massimo Righi; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Star Odyssey">STAR
    ODYSSEY</A></B> - 1978) to hang the head in the front of the castle 
   for everyone to see. Gorca begins to act strange, refusing to eat 
   dinner, watching Vladimir sleep through his bedroom window and taking 
   an unhealthy interest in his young grandson, whom he kidnaps after 
   killing Pietro. Vladimir falls in love with Sdenka, but he can't get 
   her to leave the castle and go away with him, not even when the 
   grandson is found dead. Gregor wants to cut off the boy's head so he 
   doesn't become a Wurdulak (he already cut off Pietro's head, 
   offscreen), but Maria (Rica Dialina; <B><A HREF="death_ray_of_dr_mabuse_1964.htm">THE
    DEATH RAY OF DR. MABUSE</A></B> - 1964), the boy's mother and 
   Gregor's wife, tells Gregor if he does, he will never see her again. 
   That night, Maria hears her son cry out, &quot;Mama, I'm cold. Let me 
   in.&quot; (As my friend Steven points out, a scene stolen by Stephen 
   King for <B><A HREF="salems_lot_1979.htm">SALEM'S LOT</A></B>) and 
   when she runs to the front door and opens it, Gregor is standing 
   there and we hear Maria scream. Vladimir knows that if he hopes to 
   stop Sdenka from becoming a Wurdulak, he must kill Gorca, so he hides 
   Sdenka in the family crypt while he goes to kill Gorca. But is it 
   already too late for Sdenka?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is a damn fine piece of filmmaking, thanks to Bava's strong use 
   of color, making the hues an important part of the cast (even the 
   telephone Rosy uses is bright red in color, signifying evil). From 
   the first shot to the last, this film should be studied for its 
   compositions, which are beautiful and dangerous, sometimes in the 
   same shot. No one frames a scene like Bava. Pay particular attention 
   to the way Bava bathes Helen's apartment in colors and how the camera 
   focuses on an object in the forefront, but wants you to pay attention 
   to the action going on in the background. You will see a master at 
   work and a horror film unlike anything that came before or after it.

   about Bava (especially the way too expensive book on him by Tim 
   Lucas), but I wish more people would take an interest in his work, 
   because there was really no one else like him when it came to 
   eliciting atmosphere and a sense of dread. Even Bava's own son, 
   Lamberto Bava (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Macabre1980">MACABRE</A></B>

   with a camera, as his films run hot and cold, while his father's were 
   always memorable, even when the stories weren't that interesting 
   (such as <B><A HREF="hatchet_for_the_honeymoon_1970.htm">HATCHET FOR 
   A HONEYMOON</A></B> - 1970 and <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON

   Fondato (Bava's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> - 1964) and Alberto Bevilacqua (Bava's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#PlanetVampires1965">PLANET
    OF THE VAMPIRES</A></B> - 1965), claims that these stories were 
   based on the writings of Anton Chekov, Alexi Tolstoy and Guy de 
   Maupassant, but that is blatantly untrue, as they never wrote stories 
   that are even similar to the ones on display here. What this film 
   does have is the first hint of giallo on screen (&quot;The 
   Telephone&quot; episode) and a terrific, frightening performance by 
   Boris Karloff, probably his best role during the latter half of his 
   career (Karloff also makes an excellent on-screen narrator, as it 
   looks like he is having loads of fun introducing each of the three 
   segments). And that alone should be reason enough for you to watch 
   this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   the Italian and the A.I.P. versions, which means you will have to 
   shell out your money twice to get both versions, which would have fit 
   comfortably on one disc, since Kino is known for offering little in 
   the way of extras on their disc releases. My advice is to go for the 
   Italian version if you want to see the film as Bava saw it, but I

   has reluctantly returned home to stop the sale of his father's farm 
   by Angus and to try and get over his fear of sheep at his therapist's 
   urging. Sometimes therapists are full of shit, as Henry will soon 
   find out. Angus hands Henry a check for two million dollars (his 
   share of the sale), but Henry feels uneasy about accepting the money 
   because he knows that Angus is up to no good. Henry might <A HREF="black_sheep_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black sheep 2006 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>want
    to hold on to that check because things are about to get very weird. 
   A few miles down the road, two vegetarian environmentalists, 
   Experience (Danielle Mason) and Grant (Oliver Driver), steal a 
   canister of genetic waste from an experimental laboratory. While 
   running away, Grants stumbles and drops the canister, breaking it, 
   and out pops a genetically altered baby mutant sheep. It bites Grant 
   on the ear and then goes on its merry way to infect the first flock 
   of sheep it runs across, turning them into human-hating killing 
   machines. While Grant starts mutating into a weresheep (I kid [ahem] 
   you not. He begins eating live bunny rabbits and then moves on to 
   larger prey.), Experience, who hasn't heard a New Age-y mantra she 
   hasn't repeated more than once, joins forces with Henry and his old 
   friend Tucker (Tammy Davis) to fight the mutating angry sheep and 
   make it to safety. When it's revealed that Angus is involved in the 
   genetic engineering of sheep (Grant gives him a bite on the hand as a 
   big &quot;Fuck You!!!&quot;), Henry, Experience and Tucker (who is 
   slowly being turned into a mutated sheep after being bitten on the 
   foot) try to stop Angus and head genetic scientist Dr. Rush (Tandri 
   Wright), but Tucker is captured, while Henry and Experience fall into 
   a pit of decaying sheep parts (the results of failed experiments) 
   when they try to get away. They are not alone in the pit and beat a 
   hasty retreat when they find a series of tunnels that run under the 
   farm. They run into a fully-mutated Grant (a sight to behold) and 
   then witness the slaughter of Angus' potential investors at an 
   unveiling of a new breed of successfully genetically-altered sheep 
   stock (Angus falls in love with the single mutated female sheep and 
   then has sex with it, luckily for us, off-screen!). It all ends at 
   the Oldfield family farm, where secrets are revealed, fears are 
   erased, antidotes are administered. a airplane's propeller is used as 
   a murder weapon and the mutated sheep emit highly-flammable 
   flatulence. Shear brilliance!&nbsp; This goofball and extremely 
   bloody horror film, directed and written by Jonathan King (<B><A HREF="under_the_mountain_2009.htm">UNDER
    THE MOUNTAIN</A></B> - 2009), is not only funny as hell, it also 
   contains some outstanding makeup effects which are refreshingly 
   CGI-free. The sight of a fully-mutated Grant shearing himself is sure 
   to raise a chuckle or two, but when Angus begins to slowly transform, 
   first by speech (&quot;Those baaa-stards!&quot;) and then physically 
   (his bitten hand turns into a sheep's hoof), while watching all his 
   investors get devoured by a flock of infected sheep, I dare you not 
   to laugh out loud. This sequence is definitely the film's gore 
   highlight, as arms are bitten off, intestines pulled out of stomachs, 
   throats torn out, faces bitten off, a priest reading out loud from 
   the Bible (the word &quot;flock&quot; is mentioned) before getting 
   his just due and other bloody mayhem; all filmed not only for maximum 
   visual impact, but also for maximum comical effect. I guarantee that 
   you will never look at sheep the same way again (I grew up with 
   sheep, so I know their normal temperment, but director King had me a 
   believer in a very short time, thanks to some well-edited cuts 
   between real sheep and the animatronic kind) and this would make a 
   great companion piece with underrated director Fredric Hobbs' <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Godmonster">GODMONSTER

   where Princess Asa Vajda (Barbara Steele; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#HorribleDrHitch1962">THE
    HORRIBLE DR. HICHCOCK</A></B> - 1962) is accused by her brother of 
   being a witch and a vampire and working in concert with Igor Javutich 
   (Arturo Dominici; <B><A HREF="castle_of_blood_1964.htm">CASTLE OF BLOOD</A></B>

   deaths. Before she is to be burned alive, she must wear the &quot;Mask
    of Satan&quot;, a bronze mask with sharp metal spikes on the inside. 
   Before the mask is put on her (one is also put on Igor, which we do 
   not see), Asa curses her brother, saying, &quot;You will never escape 
   my vengeance, or of Satan's! My revenge will seek you out, and with 
   the blood of your sons, and their sons, and their sons, I will 
   continue to live forever! They will restore me to life you now rob 
   from me!&quot; The masked executioner then used a giant wooden hammer 
   to pound the mask on Asa's face (a scene which is still hard to watch 
   today). When they try to burn Asa and Igor's bodies at the stake, a 
   sudden storm erupts and douses the flames, so they place Asa's body 
   in the family crypt (Her sarcophagus has a window in it, so if she is 
   ever to come back to life, she will see a crucifix outside the

    OBSESSION</A></B> - 1981), traveling in a carriage to a scientific 
   conference in Moscow. When Choma tells the coachman, Nikita (Mario 
   Passante), to take the shortcut through the forest because it will 
   save them time, Nikita is hesitant to do it. Choma asks him if he is 
   scared of the &quot;witch&quot;, which legend says roams the forest 
   and Nikita replies, &quot;It's not so easy to frighten me. I fought 
   through the whole war against Napoleon, but to tell you the truth, 
   I'd rather find myself face-to-face with that cursed Frenchman than 
   meet up with a ghost!&quot; Choma tosses Nikita a coin and tells him 
   to get moving. When Andre hears wailing coming from outside, Choma 
   tells him it's nothing, just the wind whistling through the trees. 
   They then hear Nikita scream, saying the branches from the trees 
   tried to reach out and choke him. Choma tells him to try not to choke 
   himself with the bottle of vodka he is holding and to get moving (All 
   the trees in the forest look dead, as there is no foliage on any of 
   the bare branches). As they are passing some ruins, their coach loses 
   a wheel, but Nikita says he can fix it, the wheel just slipped off 
   the axle. Andre and Choma once again hear the wailing and go to 
   investigate. They end up in a ruined chapel and the wailing sound is 
   coming from an old organ, the wind blowing through its pipes. They 
   then enter a crypt, notice Asa's sarcophagus and see the bronze mask 
   through the window. When Andre goes to help Nikita, Choma is attacked 
   by a giant bat, which he shoots and kills with his pistol, 
   accidentally breaking the glass window in Asa's sarcophagus with his 
   cane. Andre comes running when he hears the gunshots, commenting that 
   bats usually run away from people, not attack them. Then Choma does 
   something extremely stupid; he pulls the bronze Mask of Satan off of 
   Asa's face, revealing that her face is still intact after two 
   centuries (but missing her eyes, as we watch spiders crawl out of her 
   empty eyesockets!). Choma cuts his hand on a piece of broken glass 
   when removing the mask, his blood dripping into Asa's empty 
   eyesockets. Choma and Andre then leave the crypt and run into the 
   mysterious Princess Katya (Steele again), who has two huge bull 
   mastiffs on leashes. When Andre apologizes for entering the chapel 
   because he thought it was abandoned, Katya tells him that everything 
   is going to ruin, because he father, Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Holocaust2000-1977">HOLOCAUST
    2000</A></B> - 1977), refuses to repair anything, even his own 
   chapel, because, &quot;This place, in his eyes, is a curse.&quot; 
   Nikita then announces that the coach is repaired and they can leave, 
   but Andre tells Katya he won't say goodbye to her because he hopes 
   they will meet again. Count on it. Choma and Andre decide to spend 
   the night in the nearest village, as the camera pans on Asa's tomb, 
   showing us that her body is beginning to regenerate.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Katya playing the piano, while he father sits mournfully 
   by the fireplace. He hears howling coming from outside and when 
   Katya's brother, Constantine (Enrico Olivieri), says it is wolves, 
   his father says no, it's not wolves, it's something much more evil. 
   He then notices that a painting of Asa, his ancestor, has changed 
   position and Katya agrees, but Constantine says that the portrait has 
   always had a strange effect on his sister. Katya says, &quot;It's 
   like a flame that can't escape. There's something alive about it. 
   Something different about the eyes, the hands, as if it were hiding 
   something. Sometimes, I'm afraid to go near it.&quot; The Prince 
   feels a sudden chill, as if it were coming out of the fireplace and 
   penetrating his bones. He tells Katya and Constantine to go to bed, 
   saying to them, &quot;My eyes aren't tired. My spirit is.&quot; and 
   that he wants to be alone. When manservant Ivan (Tino Bianchi; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ManiacResponsible">THE
    MANIAC RESPONSIBLE</A></B> - 1975) serves the Prince his nightcap, 
   the Prince says to him he has served in this house for many years 
   (Ivan says, &quot;I was born here.&quot;) and today is the Feast of 
   Saint George and he must know the legend of the curse that was placed 
   on this castle. &quot;Two centuries ago today, two people were 
   executed for practicing witchcraft; Princess Aja and her accomplice, 
   Prince Igor Javutich, and to their faces was nailed the Mask of 
   Satan. A hundred years later, again on the Feast of Saint George, an 
   earthquake destroyed only the ancient chapel and the witch's tomb was 
   found split open, as if Asa tried to break out to accomplish her 
   revenge. In fact, that same night, Princess Masha died 
   mysteriously.&quot; The Prince goes on to explain that both his 
   daughter and Princess Masha are very beautiful; the mirror image of 
   Asa, and Princess Masha was 21-years-old when she died, just as Katya 
   is today. The Prince is scared and tormented about history repeating 
   itself today, worried for Katya's safety. All Ivan has to say is, 
   &quot;You mustn't be afraid, my Lord. The cross will protect you. 
   Even if what you said is true, these monsters are terrified by the 
   sacred symbol of Christ. Always have it near you and you'll be 
   safe.&quot; The Prince finds comfort in Ivan's words<A HREF="black_sunday_1960.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black sunday dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and thanks him, blaming the atmosphere surrounding this cursed day 
   for being scared for his daughter. When the Prince goes to drink his 
   hot toddy, he sees a reflection of the Mask of Satan in the liquid 
   and swears that evil won't win; he has the symbol of Christ on his 
   side. We then see that Asa's body now has eyes, so it won't be long 
   before she's up and walking again.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Andre and Choma are now at the village inn, Andre getting drunk on 
   vodka and pining for Katya, but Choma tells him to get some sleep, 
   they're getting up early in the morning to travel to Moscow. The 
   innkeeper's daughter, Sonya (Germana Dominici; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SeventhGrave1965">THE
    SEVENTH GRAVE</A></B> - 1965; the daughter of Arturo Dominici), is 
   too scared to milk the cow at night, so the Innkeeper (Clara Bindi; <B><A HREF="pirate_and_the_slave_girl_1959.htm">THE
    PIRATE AND THE SLAVE GIRL</A></B> - 1959) asks Choma if it is 
   ridiculous for her daughter to feel this way. Choma says yes and 
   basically shames Sonya to go and milk the cow. Near the barn where 
   the cow is, Igor Javutich is rising from his grave, wearing the Mask 
   of Satan. He pulls the mask from his head, revealing an old and 
   wrinkled face. When he removes the Mask, a sudden gust of wind 
   invades the Prince's castle, waking up the Prince. Igor appears in 
   the Prince's bedroom, walking slowly towards him, Igor's face looking 
   very much like he spent two hundred years buried in dirt. The Prince 
   grabs his gold crucifix from his night table and puts it in front of 
   Igor's face and he quickly disappears. Katya, Constantine and Ivan 
   quickly run into the Prince's bedroom and find him near death, but 
   Katya remembers that Andre and Choma are doctors and sends stablehand 
   Boris (Renato Terra; <B><A HREF="castle_of_the_living_dead_1964.htm">THE
    CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1964) to the village to fetch them.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Choma is outside the inn enjoying his pipe, Igor pulls up in a 
   coach pretending to be a servant from the Prince's castle (His face 
   now looks normal, but we will learn soon that's there a reason for 
   it). He tells Choma that the Prince is very ill, so they sent him to 
   fetch a doctor and Katya mentioned him. Choma wants to tells Andre 
   where he is going, but Igor tells him he already spoke to his 
   colleague, so Choma gets into the coach and they ride away (Igor 
   doesn't know it, but Sonya saw him take Choma away, as she was hiding 
   behind a tree and saw everything). Igor takes Choma to a castle, but 
   it's not the Prince's castle, as Choma can see cobwebs everywhere. 
   Igor locks Choma in a room, his fate to be revealed shortly. When a 
   door suddenly opens and Choma walks through it, he can see he is in 
   Asa's crypt. Asa rises from her tomb and tells Choma, &quot;You will 
   be dead to man, but you will be alive in death!&quot; Then she 
   'kisses&quot; Choma and begins drinking his blood (offscreen). Choma, 
   now a vampire, shows up in the Prince's bedroom and tells Katya and 
   Constantine to leave the room, he will take care of their father. 
   When Constantine shows Choma the gold crucifix his father was 
   holding, Choma jerks his head away, saying his father should should 
   not have it any more, it will worsen his condition. When Katya and 
   Constantine retire for the night, they find out the next morning that 
   their father is dead and Choma has disappeared. When Katya tekes a 
   look at her father, she discovers his face old and wrinkled, as if 
   the life was sucked out of his body (she doesn't realize how right 
   she is). Meanwhile, Andre is looking for Choma, only to be told by 
   the Innkeeper that Sonya saw a strange man pick him up and drive him 
   to the Prince's castle. Andre borrows a horse and rides to the 
   castle, only to be told by Constantine that he blames Choma for his 
   father's death. Andre says it's not like Choma to do such a thing and 
   promises to get to the bottom of the matter.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Boris is found dead in the river (killed by Igor, who drank his 
   blood to regain his looks), Andre talks to Sonya, telling him it 
   wasn't Boris who picked up Choma (she knows Boris), but a man she has 
   never seen before. When Sonya walks into the castle and sees an old 
   portrait of Igor, she tells Andre that's the man who picked up Choma. 
   Katya is skeptical, asking how a man who has been dead for two 
   centuries could suddenly be alive? Katya then asks Andre to stay in 
   the castle; she will feel much safer if he does. That night, Choma 
   pays Andre a visit in the castle and Andre notices how his 
   colleague's hair has turned white, but Katya begins screaming, saying 
   she saw a black hand behind the curtains in her bedroom, but Andre 
   finds nothing. When Katya's dogs are found dead, their throats 
   slashed, Andre knows that Choma is somehow involved. Things come to a 
   head when Andre and Constantine find a hidden passageway behind the 
   fireplace in the castle, which leads them to Asa's crypt, where they 
   discover Asa's body, seemingly alive. When Constantine is captured by 
   Igor (He kills Ivan), Andre works with a local Priest (Antonio 
   Pierfederici) to get the answers they need to stop this madness. When 
   they discover Choma's body in Igor's grave, the Priest puts Choma to 
   eternal rest by piercing his left eye with his crucifix. The Priest 
   tells Andre that Asa will come fully to life when she possesses a 
   suitable body. Andre knows that body is Katya's, so he rushes to the 
   castle before it is too late. When Igor kidnaps an unconscious Katya 
   (who fainted after setting her vampire father's body on fire, killing 
   him) and places her body next to Asa's, it's a race against time, as 
   Andre must pierce Asa's left eye with a crucifix before she possesses 
   Katya's body. Will he succeed or will it be too late? Will Asa, who 
   is pretending to be Katya, convince Andre to destroy &quot;Asa's&quot;
    body or will he discover the deception? And what about Constantine? 
   Is he still alive? I will tell you this: Just when it seems that 
   darkness has won and Katya is dead, the villagers burn Asa's body, 
   doing to her what should have been done two hundred years ago. Will 
   this release Katya from an eternity in Purgatory or is she doomed? 
   All questions will be answered at the film's conclusion.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This Gothic horror film is quite gruesome in spots (especially the 
   mask being hammered onto Asa's face and the vampire Prince being 
   burned alive by Katya) and shows Mario Bava's mastery with a camera, 
   as he was a well-respected cinematographer before becoming a 
   director. The camera floats effortlessly in most of the scenes, 
   decades before there was such a thing as a Steadicam. Bava's use of 
   shadows is second-to-none, adding an extra layer of eerie atmosphere 
   to the film. You can actually feel the dread that permeates every 
   frame of film and there's no denying Bava was a master of his craft. 
   Bava based the screenplay, written by Ennio De Concini (Bava's <B><A HREF="evil_eye_1963.htm">EVIL
    EYE</A></B> - 1963) &amp; Mario Serandrei (who edited this film, as 
   well as Bava's <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#HerculesHauntWrld61">HERCULES 
   IN THE HAUNTED WORLD</A></B> - 1961 and <B><A HREF="#BlackSabbath1963">BLACK
    SABBATH</A></B> - 1963), with an uncredited assist by Bava, on 
   Nikolay Gogol's story &quot;The Viy&quot;, saying he would read it to 
   his children at bedtime and they would get so scared that they would 
   sleep in his bed for the night. He thought it would be the perfect 
   first feature film for him as credited director and you would be 
   hard-pressed to disagree with him. This film was a hit across the 
   world, especially for American International Pictures (A.I.P.), who 
   picked it up for distribution in the United States, re-edited it 
   (removing a scene which implies that Asa and Igor were sister and 
   brother and in an incestuous relationship), replaced Roberto 
   Nicolosi's (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#EyeInTheLabyrinth">EYE IN 
   THE LABYRINTH</A></B> - 1972) music score with one by Lex Baxter, and 
   re-dubbed the film, even though it was already dubbed in English 
   (it's quite obvious that everyone was speaking English in the film, 
   but A.I.P. thought their accents would turn-off theatergoers). It was 
   A.I.P.'s biggest moneymaker at the time, even out-grossing Roger 
   Corman's Edgar Allan Poe films. The film was outright banned in the <A HREF="black_sunday_1960.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black sunday italy poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>UK
    until 1968 (and that version was heavily cut), when it was released 
   as <B><A HREF="black_sunday_1960.htm#RevengeOfTheVampire">REVENGE OF 
   THE VAMPIRE</A></B>. The fully uncut &quot;European Version&quot;, 
   which ran 87 minutes (A.I.P.'s version ran 84 minutes), was not 
   released in Britain until 1992. It's easy to see why this film 
   kick-started the Italian horror film industry, as there was no film 
   quite like it at the time, introducing theatergoers to real scares 
   for the first time across the globe. It also caused an immediate 
   output of Gothic horror films to come out of Italy, some very good, 
   some just passable and some simply awful, but it was Bava who proved 
   himself to be a visual innovator at atmospheric horror, the likes of 
   no one who came before him. Mario Bava is also credited with making 
   Giallo films very popular, as his <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> (1964), while not the first Giallo film, was 
   the blueprint for others that came after it, well into the '70s and 
   beyond. He is also credited as being the father of Slasher films, as 
   his <B><A HREF="#BayOfBlood1971">A BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> (1971) was 
   also the blueprint for other Slasher films that came long after it, 
   some of them (especially the <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_franchise_1980-2009.htm">FRIDAY
    THE 13TH</A></B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_franchise_1980-2009.htm"> franchise</A>)
    copying the killings in that film verbatim. There is no doubt in my 
   mind that Mario Bava was a filmic genius and even his lesser films, 
   such as <B><A HREF="hatchet_for_the_honeymoon_1970.htm">HATCHET FOR 
   THE HONEYMOON</A></B> (1970) and <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON
    BLOOD</A></B> (1972) offered viewers much in the way of visual 
   delights, even if the plot suffered. This film is essential viewing 
   for all fans of horror, if only to see Mario Bava at the beginning of 
   his game, hitting the ball out of the park on his very first try.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Archaeologists make an important discovery at a dig site. They 
   unearth an ancient (and large) pieces of board game that use to 
   entertain demons circa 4th Century B.C. Inscribed on the top of the 
   game's cover is a warning to all non-demons that play the game: 
   &quot;Oh great Pan! Only thy flute can arouse the the list of a 
   Demoness or laughter of a Muse at play.&quot; On a stone tablet, 
   there are instructions on how to build the game and the 
   archaeologists feel it is their duty to build it (Now wait a goddamn 
   minute. If you found instructions on how to build a nuclear bomb, 
   would you automatically build it if you were a physicist, even though 
   it comes with a dire warning?). Apparently they take it to the small 
   Beacon's Isle off the coast of Maine and build it, which pisses off 
   dig financier Nicholas (Richard Tyson; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hayride2013">HAYRIDE</A></B> 
   - 2013) when archaeologist Neigel (Adamo Palladino) calls him on the 
   phone. Nicholas is of the thought that if there is a warning about 
   building an ancient game, it shouldn't be built. Nicholas takes a 
   boat ride to the island, where he is met by a rather nervous and 
   disheveled Neigel. The driver of the boat heads up towards the house 
   and gets a surprise of his own: The Professor of the dig is hanging 
   upside down with with spikes impaled in his eyes and his journal 
   shoved in his mouth. Down at the dock, something (we only get a short 
   glimpse of it, but it has horns) throws the Professor's body at 
   Nicholas' feet and he automatically knows that he is too late. The 
   game has been built. Nicholas has a discussion with Neigel, who tells 
   him the game has killed them all, but he has hidden it in the house 
   (The game is indestructable, as Neigel has tried to set it on fire) 
   where no one can find it, but Nicholas tells him that he will find 
   the game and destroy it, because &quot;That is what we do!&quot;. 
   Neigel pulls out a pistol and shoots Nicholas in the head and then 
   turns the gun on himself, committing suicide by pulling the trigger 
   while the gun is in his mouth . You see, once the game is built, it 
   can't be destroyed. <B>Beacon's Isle, Maine - Present Day:</B> a 
   group of young twenty-somethings (all<A HREF="black_waters_of_echos_pond_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black waters of echo's pond dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="242" HEIGHT="342" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   cliches, every single one of them) are going to have a party on the 
   island, now owned by the jittery Pete (Robert Patrick; <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
    X-FILES</A></B> [2000 - 2002]), who fires a shotgun over his nephew 
   Anton's (Arcadiy Golubovich) head, forgetting that he gave Anton and 
   his friends permission to have a party at the island's only house. 
   Pete tells the entire group about the legend of the Ghoul of Beacon's 
   Isle (and we all know that legends begin with truth that over time 
   gets blown out of proportion). After Pete tells his story, the 
   electricity goes out, so Anton volunteers to go to the basement to 
   fix the fusebox. While walking down the basement stairs, he falls 
   through a rotting board and discovers the ancient game. They bring 
   the rather large game to the living room, where Kathy (Danielle 
   Harris; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HatchetIII2013">HATCHET III</A></B> 
   - 2013; and one of the worst actresses working today) wants to play 
   the game (&quot;It's like playing Monopoly, right?&quot; Yeah, that's 
   right, Milton Bradley stole their idea from a game demons play!). 
   After the group starts playing the game (it's like an old-time 
   version of Truth or Dare), it begins to have an immediate effect on 
   everyone playing it, as one member sees another member with a demon 
   face (the one on the DVD cover).The blame game starts, as Kathy 
   blames Rick (James Duval; <B><A HREF="sushi_girl_2012.htm">SUSHI GIRL</A></B> 
   - 2012) for her brother's drunk driving death. She believes that Rick 
   should have taken his keys. As they continue playing the game, the 
   secrets come pouring out and not a single one of them is good. As a 
   matter of fact, friends start turning against friends over the 
   littlest of things and they all want Rick off the island tomorrow 
   morning. While smoking pot and drinking beer, the game also becomes 
   sexual, as twins Renee &amp; Erica (Electra &amp; Elise Avellan; <B><A HREF="planet_terror_2007.htm">PLANET
    TERROR</A></B> - 2007) agree to have sex with each other's husbands, 
   but it all turns out to be a trick to get them to go skinny-dipping 
   in the lake (one of the few instances of nudity in the film). The 
   game also has some moveable mechanical parts, one which exposes 
   &quot;Echo's Pond&quot;. When you look into it, you either see what 
   has happened in the past or what is going to happen in the future. 
   Trent (Walker Howard) looks into Echo's Pond and sees how Robert 
   (M.D. Walton) sabotaged his job promotion, so he hits him over the 
   head with a rock, ties him up and drags him to the basement. He then 
   begins to pull out Robert's teeth with pliers (a very bloody scene). 
   He then cuts Robert in two with a chainsaw (off-screen). The game 
   plays with everyone's psyche and possesses them (you can tell because 
   their eyes are pure black). Jealousy begins to rear its ugly head, as 
   a series of incidents turn deadlier and deadlier. One of the twin's 
   husbands kills the other by impaling his head with a metal rake, 
   because he actually believes that he was having an affair with his 
   wife. By the time the evening is over, Pan and some other demons put 
   in appearances and more people end up dead. Trent tries to kill 
   Kathy, but Rick saves the night and takes Kathy to the dock. Rick has 
   to run to the house to get the boat keys (where he discovers Robert's 
   body cut in two) and when he goes outside, he is attacked by the 
   possessed twins, who have just killed arrogant starlet Veronique 
   (Mircea Monroe; <B><A HREF="bloodworx_2012.htm">BLOODWOR</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="bloodworx_2012.htm">X</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   - 2012). Renee says to Rick, &quot;I always did want her ass!&quot; 
   and then holds up Veronique's cut-off ass for him to see. Rick is 
   forced to kill the twins (One falls off a cliff and is impaled on a 
   piece of driftwood and the other has her throat cut.). Kathy and Rick 
   are attacked by Trent, but a black-eyed Anton tries to kill them all, 
   only to get shotgunned to death by Pete. Pete says he has some 
   business to take care of, so Kathy and Rick hide out in the boat 
   house, where they find Pete in pieces in a lobster cage. Kathy falls 
   asleep (!) and dreams that Rick was actually driving the car her 
   brother died in. She wakes up and accuses Rick of this very thing, 
   but before Rick can say anything, Trent breaks into the boat house 
   with a chainsaw and Rick tosses Kathy into the chainsaw's spinning 
   blade, it going through her torso and out her back (It looks like 
   Kathy was right). Trent (who also has black eyes) tosses Kathy's body 
   into the water and goes after Rick with a knife, but Rick finds a 
   speargun and fires a bolt into Trent's torso. Trent pulls out the 
   bolt and he and Rick get into a fight, with Rick sticking his finger 
   into Trent's bolt hole. Rick wins the fight when he chokes-out Trent 
   with a fishing pole (the pole's shaft cuts through his neck like 
   butter) and Trent falls into the water. The film ends with the camera 
   zooming in and out of Rick's eye, as we find Rick playing the board 
   game hours earlier (it seems that everything that happened was just 
   Rick's mind working overtime), but he remembers everything that has 
   happened during the night. When Rick removes his hands from his eyes, 
   they are all black. THE END.&nbsp; The best way to describe this film 
   is ordinary.There's nothing here we haven't seen done before (just 
   substitute the board game with an ouija board), but it is at least 
   done well. The board is a neat-looking contraption, but we never get 
   a really good look at it as a whole, just pieces of it as people are 
   rolling dice, moving their pieces and reading cards. One gets the 
   feeling that director/co-screenwriter Gabriel Bologna (The Asylum's 
   awful <B><A HREF="30000_leagues_inder_the_sea_2007.htm">30,000 
   LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA</A></B> - 2007) should have kept the film in 
   1907 rather than modernizing it because, in my opinion, it would make 
   for a much better film (and we would have more Richard Tyson, a 
   terribly underrated actor). As you probably already know, I'm not a 
   big fan of Danielle Harris because she acts the same in all her 
   movies. She screams out all her lines, which becomes 
   headache-inducing after a short period. She may be good-looking, but 
   her acting prowess could be vastly improved on. Having a nice body is 
   fine if you are a body double, but if you want to be an actress, you 
   have to actually act (Veronique brings up this very topic in one of 
   her discussions). Co-screenwriter Sean Clark acted in <B><A HREF="tales_of_halloween_2015.htm">TALES
    OF HALLOWEEN</A></B> (2015) as well as a few more actors in this 
   film and Executive Producer Robert Patrick is given far too little 
   screen time. Nothing special, but not as bad as it could have been.

   Manor to find out the truth of what happened there in 1975. When 
   Lukas and Barbara stop at a pub on the way to the manor, they notice 
   all the patrons (even a dog!) have a strange symbol tattooed on their 
   bodies and it soon becomes apparent to the viewers that most of the to<A HREF="bloodbath_at_the_house_of_death_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloodbath at the house of death vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>wnspeople
    belong to a satanic cult ruled by the 700 year-old Sinister Man 
   (Vincent Price; who, in his very first scene, delivers a hilarious 
   monologue in reply to a female cult member, who tells him to 
   &quot;piss off&quot;.). It seems that nine years earlier, the 
   Sinister Man was supposed to resurrect Satan at Headstone Manor, but 
   the presence of the eighteen borders stopped him from doing so. 
   Tonight is the night to try again, but the sudden appearance of Lukas 
   and the gang at the manor may hamper the resurrection, so Satan sends 
   evil doppelgangers of Lukas and his team into the manor to kill the 
   pesky humans. As the doppelgangers come up with creative ways to 
   dispose of their human counterparts, lone survivor Barbara is 
   whisked-off to safety by her new invisible lover (in a manner sure to 
   upset Steven Spielberg), thereby foiling Satan's plans once again for 
   world domination. Won't that horned devil ever learn?&nbsp; This is a 
   hit-or-miss kitchen sink comedy that contains more misses than hits, 
   but it does have some laugh-out-loud moments and, surprisingly, a lot 
   of them come courtesy of Vincent Price, who shows an uncanny knack 
   for comedy timing, swears like a truck driver and looks like he's 
   having the time of his life here. Director/producer/co-scripter Ray

   and early-80's imaginable (in one such instance, Stephenson gets 
   raped by an invisible presence, ala Pamela Franklin in <B><A HREF="legend_of_hell_house_1973.htm">THE
    LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE</A></B> [1973], only Stephenson shares a

   of <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> (1979), Everett 
   collapses on the dinner table and his stomach looks as if something 
   is about to burst through it. After a minute of screaming and rolling 
   about, Everett lets out a loud burp and everything's fine (What can I 
   say? I'm a sucker for burp and fart jokes.). The makeup effects are 
   surprisingly well done and graphic, but are always used for comic 
   effect (there's a death by telephone that's a direct steal from 
   Price's <B><A HREF="abominable_dr_phibes_1971.htm">THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES</A></B> 
   [1971] and when evil doppelganger Elliot [Gareth Hunt] strangles his 
   human counterpart, the real Elliott wonders, &quot;Does this count as 
   suicide?&quot;). There are also knife-carrying teddy bears and other 
   comical mayhem, like a blood-spewing bathroom whose toilet swallows 
   paranormal investigator Henry (John Stephen Hill; who sports the 
   biggest arm mole in film history) whole, but the film really belongs 
   to Vincent Price, who brings big laughs in the few scenes he is in. 
   When he dies (He tells his cult, &quot;Well don't just stand there, 
   light the faggots!&quot; and they accidentally burn him to death!), 
   the film loses it's greatest comical asset. Truthfully, I didn't find

    Confusing storyline, lousy sound, flubbed lines, cheap optical 
   effects and below-par photography. But when they are mixed in 
   together it proves to be a fascinating (if mind-boggling) experience. 
   A family, with a few secrets of their own, are terrorized by the 
   spectre of a Japanese samurai warrior (at least I think it is a 
   samurai warrior, the story is that confusing!) at their home deep in 
   the woods. The mother, who goes into trances and paints surreal 
   pictures, suffers migraine headaches and emits glowing red rays from 
   her hands. The brother, who has come home from college along with his 
   sister to celebrate Christmas, brings his girlfriend who has the same 
   type of attacks as his mother. She believes she has been in this 
   house before and has dreams of the surrounding neighbors being 
   slaughtered by the sword-waving warrior. The mother's boyfriend, a 
   deer hunter, walks around the house looking perplexed, wondering what 
   the hell is going on (at least I'm not the only one!). People begin 
   to die, some by sword, some by arrow before Mom's two kids step in 
   and dispatch the sword-weilding samurai with their newfound magical 
   power. Are you as confused as I am? Good! I wish I could describe the 
   plot better, but the damn music soundtrack kept drowning out crucial 
   bits of dialogue which could have helped explained this mess. There 
   is some nudity (the girlfriend has the smallest nipples I have ever 
   seen on a woman!) and bloody gore (knives entering bodies, a bloody 
   stomach and neck wound) to keep your mind briefly occupied, but your 
   brain will continually try to make sense of the screenplay. Good 
   luck. Where else in the world can you see a French-made film about a 
   Japanese killer on the loose in the United States shot by a Russian 
   cinematographer (Vladimir Van Maule)? In this aspect alone, <B><A HREF="bloodbeat_1982c.htm">BLOODBEAT</A></B>

   The funny thing is, <B><A HREF="blood_creek_2008b.htm">BLOOD CREEK</A></B> 
   belongs on the big screen because it is quite entertaining and 
   somewhat ingenious, to boot. The film opens in the 1930's, when 
   Adolph Hitler was in search of Nordic runestones. He believed these 
   runestones would lead the Nazi race to world domination and even 
   immortality (It is a well-known fact that Hitler was very interested 
   in the Black Arts and how it could help his cause, both personally 
   and professionally). We then switch to a pig farm in Morgan County, 
   West Virginia. The year is 1936&nbsp; and farm owner Otto Wollner 
   (Rainer Winkelvoss) receives a letter from Berlin that asks him to 
   host Richard Wirth (Michael Fassbender; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#EdenLake">EDEN
    LAKE</A></B> - 2008; <B><A HREF="prometheus_2012.htm">PROMETHEUS</A></B>

    heritage&quot;. I don't know about you, but this whole enterprise 
   doesn't smell kosher, but Otto and <A HREF="blood_creek_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood creek poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="321" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>his
    family will receive $150 a month (a lot of money in 1936) as long as 
   Wirth stays with them, so Otto agrees even though Mama Wollner (Joy 
   McBrinn) has reservations. The mysterious Herr Wirth arrives with a 
   few trunks packed with books on the supernatural and before long he's 
   making statements like &quot;Columbus was a fraud&quot; and 
   &quot;Soon, the whole world will be speaking German!&quot; He is 
   particularly interested in the runestone Otto has recently dug up on 
   his property (He tells Otto that the Norsemen were the first to 
   discover America, but the Indians chased them away. They left a few 
   magical runestones behind before they fled.) and when Otto tells him 
   that he used the runestone as part of the foundation to build his 
   barn, Herr Wirth says, &quot;How forward thinking of you!&quot; Mama 
   Wollner is very leery of Herr Wirth and for good reason, as he has a 
   briefcase containing the skull and spinal column of some as 
   yet-unknown person, along with a dagger with runic symbols on it. 
   Herr Wirth goes to the basement of the barn, where Otto's young 12 
   year-old daughter, Liese, is mourning the death of her pet bird. 
   Wirth takes the corpse of the bird and recites an incantation next to 
   the runestone in the foundation (which contains ancient symbols that 
   the Nazis would adopt for their flag [the swastika] and police force 
   [the SS insignia]) and the bird comes back to life, but only for a 
   short while. Wirth says that with more practice, he could bring dead 
   things back to life permanently and then asks Liese to be his helper. 
   The film then switches (from black &amp; white to color) to 
   modern-day Morgan County, where paramedic Evan Marshall (Henry 
   Cavill; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellraiserHWorld03">HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD</A></B> 
   - 2003; and future <B><A HREF="man_of_steel_2013.htm">MAN OF STEEL</A></B> 
   - 2013) must not only have to deal with murderous overdosing 
   meth-heads at his job, but also a fucked-up personal life that 
   contains his missing brother's wife and two kids, a sickly father 
   (Gerald McSorley) and the memory of his missing brother Victor 
   (Dominic Purcell; <B><A HREF="gravedancers_2006.htm">THE GRAVEDANCERS</A></B> 
   - 2006; <B><A HREF="assault_on_wall_street_2013.htm">ASSAULT ON WALL STREET</A></B> 
   - 2013), who came home after fighting in Iraq and then mysteriously 
   disappeared two years ago when he and Evan went fishing at &quot;Town 
   Creek&quot; (the film's original title). When Victor suddenly appears 
   in Evan's trailer (with long stringy hair and a beard), he begs Evan 
   to come back to Town Creek with him to destroy an evil that can't be 
   described. It seems Victor was being held captive and tortured at 
   Otto Wollner's farm and it looks like the entire Wollner family is 
   still very much alive and kicking and have only aged five years since 
   1936. Pretty soon, you too, will be asking, just like Evan, 
   &quot;What's in the black container?&quot; I'm afraid you'll have to 
   watch the movie to find out, but I've given you enough clues in this 
   review for you to figure it out.&nbsp; This is an excellent horror 
   film (lensed in Romania) that, thankfully, contains none of director 
   Joel Schumacher's overblown excesses to remind us that we are 
   watching a Schumacher film. This is a straight-ahead horror flick and 
   David Kajganich's bizarre screenplay, which mixes Nordic legends, 
   Nazi experiments and slasher film elements, keeps the viewers on 
   their toes. There's a lot to recommend here, especially the scene 
   where a monstrous-looking Herr Wirth kills a horse, brings it back to 
   life and then sends it to kick down the door of Otto's farmhouse 
   (Wirth can't enter the house because it is protected by ancient 
   symbols painted all over it), where Victor and Evan try to kill the 
   horse with shotgun blasts to no avail. The scene is not only 
   suspenseful as hell, it's also very gory. There's a lot more to enjoy 
   here, which I will leave you to discover. The use of CGI is 
   thankfully minimal (the horse being set on fire is obvious CGI) and 
   there is loads of blood and gore on display, making this the perfect 
   film to watch with the lights out. Joel Schumacher should slum more 
   often. He's very good at it. Also starring Emma Booth as the 
   eternally 17 year-old Liese, Shea Higham, Laszlo Matray, Troy Barger 
   and Albert Gherasim. A <A HREF="http://www.lionsgatefilms.com">Lionsgate

    grave (one of them hits the graveyard's secruity guard in back of 
   the head so hard, his eyes pop out of their sockets) and put Uncle 
   Anwar's brain and eyes in a fluid-filled jar and take him back to 
   their diner, where Anwar (who can somehow speak without vocal cords) 
   tells them how to create Sheetar, an ancient Sumerian goddess who 
   will take over the world by turning everyone into mindless zombies 
   who will do her bidding. The two boys must create her from the parts 
   of the sluttiest women they can find and feed her a virgin as her 
   first meal to bring her to full life. The boys go about creating the 
   woman, first bursting in on a nude aerobics class and killing them 
   all with machine guns, taking some body parts with them. Meanwhile 
   the police chief (Max Morris) has two detectives, Sheba Jackson 
   (LaNette La France; a worse actress you will never see grace the 
   screen) and Mark Shepard (Roger Dauer; he runs a close second in the 
   bad acting department) investigate a series of murders where women of 
   ill repute are found dead with pieces of their bodies missing. 
   Meanwhile, Michael falls in love with virgin Connie Stanton (Lisa 
   Guggenheim, whose real name is Lisa Elaina), but he is still going to 
   use her as the final sacrifice. When the entire Sheetar (Tanya 
   Papanicolas) is assembled and a huge party is thrown at the diner, 
   lots of people end up dead when Sheetar is accidentally fed the head 
   of Michael rather than Connie and she starts shooting bolts of 
   electricity out of her fingertips (One guy has both ear drums 
   punctured as the bolt of lightning travels through one ear and out 
   the other), turning the patrons into zombies. The police finally put 
   an end to the madness, when they shoot all the zombies in the head, 
   kill George, destroy Anwar in his glass jar and make Sheetar (who has 
   a huge set of teeth running from her breasts to her vagina) 
   explode.&nbsp; It's beyond me why people like this film so much. Sure 
   it is gory and full of blood and guts, but nearly everyone either 
   yells out their lines (especially the Chief of Police, who for some 
   reason talks in a thick Muslim accent) or speaks in such an unnatural 
   way, like they are either reading from cue cards or just don't know 
   how to act. There is a comedy routine where George tries to run over 
   a fat guy in his catering van, only for the fat guy to get up again 
   and again; another scene where George wants to become a wrestler, so 
   he fights a guy called Little Jimmy Hitler (John Barton Shields) and 
   some of the items on the diner's menu are priceless. Still, this is 
   Jackie Kong's least professional film, since she uses none of the 
   B-movie stars that she used in her other three films. Even her

   with his hands and feeding it into his beak. He also <A HREF="blood_freak_leg_amputation.htm">amputates
    the leg</A> of a dealer with a buzzsaw (a real-life amputee; you can 
   watch him limping as he tries to run away from Herschell), letting 
   the blood from his bloody stump run all over his oversized turkey 
   head. This all turns out to be a dream. Herschell just passed out 
   after eating the turkey and dreamed the whole thing up. Angel cleans 
   up Herschell's drug addiction with the help of the Lord and Ann also 
   cleans up her act. Herschell and Ann live happily ever after. The 
   film is interrupted at various times by an on-screen narrator (Brad 
   Grinter, who shared writing, producing and directing chores on this 
   with star Hawkes), who chain-smokes while reading off a script on his 
   desk extolling the virtues of clean living and decrying the use of 
   chemicals in your body. His last on-screen appearance is a hoot as he 
   has a coughing fit while talking about putting unnatural substances 
   in your body (A lot of people seem to think this is unintentional. I 
   think otherwise. You decide.). The blood does flow in this film 
   (especially the leg amputation), but the whole film is so badly acted 
   and photographed, that you just sit there shaking your head in 
   disbelief. The DVD version of <B><A HREF="blood_freak2.htm">BLOOD FREAK</A></B> 
   is so clear, you can see the burn marks on Steve Hawkes arms that he 
   received during an accident while making some Tarzan knock-off films 
   (including <B><A HREF="tarzan_brown_prince_1969.htm">TARZAN AND THE 
   BROWN PRINCE</A></B>&nbsp; and <B><A HREF="king_of_the_jungle_1969.htm">KING

   burns in this film as being the results of Vietnam war action. Brad

    Kramer was deathly afraid of clowns. I bet half the world's adult 
   population would shit their pants if they met a clown alone in a dark 
   alley. Who wouldn't? For a profession that is supposed to bring joy 
   to children's faces, it has the exact opposite effect on adults. Put 
   Tiny Tim, the world's scariest man-child, in clown makeup and you 
   have yourself one of the screen's most perverse characters. Tim 
   portrays The Marvelous Mervo, a retarded man who wears clown makeup 
   and an outlandish colorful wardrobe. The setting is a 1980's 
   Wisconson farm town, which most of the farmers are having their 
   buisnesses foreclosed and auctioned off thanks to President Reagan's 
   economic plan. College girl Jill (Itonia 'Cari' Salochek) return to 
   town to visit her parents, who turn up missing. Jill's father is the 
   banker who is foreclosing all the farms and the sheriff and the 
   townspeople don't seem too concerned about finding him. Jill meets 
   her grade school boyfriend Gary (Ed Bevin), whose parents were 
   murdered years before, their throats cut and hung upside down in a 
   barn near Jill's parents house. These murders permanently changed 
   Gary's brother, Mervin, who is also known as The Marvelous Mervo. 
   Soon Jill is being terrorized by some person wearing a stocking over 
   his head. She is chloroformed, stripped naked and tied spread-eagle 
   to her bed while she is sleeping. The unknown assailant then takes 
   Polaroids of her and redresses her so she is none the wiser. Scott (a 
   young Peter Krause of HBO's <B><A HREF="six_feet_under_tv_series_2001-2005.htm">SIX
    FEET UNDER</A></B> [2001 - 2005]), Jill's college boyfriend, comes 
   to town to keep her company, much to Gary's chagrin as he peeps on 
   the two lovebirds making out. It's not long before Scott is 
   knocked-out and hung upside down in the barn. Jill's friend Sarah 
   (Lori Minneti) is the next victim, having an arrow shot in her hand 
   and then stripped hanging upside down in the barn and having her 
   throat cut. Jill is then abducted after being drugged and is brought 
   to the bar<A HREF="blood_harvest_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood harvest small2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="233" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>n.
    The killer makes Scott watch him sexually fondle Jill before he 
   slits Scott's throat. It's obvious to everyone that Gary is the 
   killer and it's up to Mervin to save the day before Jill becomes 
   another barn victim, even if she thinks that Mervin is the killer. 
   This was director <A HREF="late breaking news.htm#Bill Rebane">Bill Rebane</A>'s
    final film (so far) and it is most definitely his best. This is the 
   most atypical Rebane film as it is full of gore and nudity, something 
   you usually don't see in his films. It is also his best-paced film as 
   it moves very quickly and has a halfway decent plot (even if you can 
   guess who the killer is after the first 10 minutes). The late Tiny 
   Tim does a good job playing the off-kilter Mervo (I guess it was not 
   such a stretch), evoking terror as the clown-faced retard in the 
   beginning and a sympathetic (if still scary) hero in the end. The 
   film is available here for the first time on DVD in the unseen 
   director's cut under the title <B><A HREF="nightmare_aka_blood_harvest.htm">NIGHTMARE</A></B>,
    a title Rebane preferred to <B><A HREF="blood_harvest_1985.htm">BLOOD
    HARVEST</A></B> or it's alternate title <B>THE MARVELOUS MERVO</B>. 
   (This director's cut is also missing some of the extreme gore and 
   exposition found on the VHS version using the title <B><A HREF="blood_harvest_1985d.htm">BLOOD
    HARVEST</A></B>, an almost impossible to find item released in the 
   late 80s). It's must-viewing for anyone looking for something bizarre 
   and outrageous. And now a little background on Tiny Tim: Mr. Tim 
   (Real name: Herbert Butros Khaury) was most definitely an aquired 
   taste. You either loathed him or loved him as he never gave you any 
   middle ground. He had the face of a pedophile and the voice of a 
   child. That inner conflict didn't sit well with the older generation, 
   even if he sang and talked like he was living in the 1920's. The 
   counterculture took a liking to him during the late 60's, thanks to 
   his frequent appearances on <B><A HREF="rowan_and_martins_laugh_in_tv_series_1968-1972.htm">LAUGH-IN</A></B>.
    He became so popular that his wedding to Miss Vicki (whom he later 
   divorced) was held live on the <B><A HREF="johnny_carsons_tonight_show_1962-1992.htm">TONIGHT
    SHOW</A></B> with Johnny Carson. Times became hard for Tiny during 
   the late 70's into the 80's. He still had a small fan base, but the 
   general public grew tired of his act. Director Bill Rebane took a 
   liking to Tiny and offered him what was to be his only starring role. 
   Rebane even filmed a pilot for a children's show starring Tiny. It 
   never aired. After suffering several heart attacks and other bouts of 
   bad health (including debilitating migraines), Tiny Tim tiptoed off 
   this Earth on November 30, 1996, leaving behind a boxfull of 
   psychedelic memories that only us zonked-out Baby Boomers could

    NA$TY</A><A NAME="Blood Nasty"></A> (1989) -</B> It's hard to 
   believe it took two people to direct this crappy horror comedy. A 
   trio of thieves dig up the grave of notorious serial killer Luis 
   'Blade' Orlando, the &quot;Butcher from Bogota&quot; (&quot;He killed 
   for the fun of it. Claimed it kept him alive&quot;), to get a 
   valuable ring on his finger. Roy Flowers (Todd McCammon) is betrayed 
   by the other two thieves, who kill Roy (they shove a pipe through his 
   midsection and bury him on top of Blade), take the ring and hop on a 
   plane. As luck would have it, the plane explodes above Blade's grave 
   and the ring falls on top of Roy's dead body. Roy comes back to life 
   (he walks around comically with the pipe through his body until he 
   has someone cut off both ends), possessed by the spirit of Blade. 
   Roy's white trash family, Mom (Catherine McGuinness) and Sis (Allison 
   Barron), think Roy is dead since his cohorts used his ticket on the 
   ill-fated flight. A lawyer by the name of Barry Hefna (Troy Donahue) <A HREF="blood_nasty_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood nasty greek vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>comes
    to their house and hands Mom a check for $300,000, the insurance 
   payout for his death in the plane explosion. When Roy shows up at 
   Mom's new house alive, money-hungry Mom must find a way to keep her 
   son's sudden appearance a secret from Barry, who shows up at the most 
   inconvenient times. Roy begins having spells, where he speaks in a 
   Spanish accent (Mom says, &quot;What is it with this beaner talk? 
   It's native wetback!&quot;), starts to decompose and is prone to 
   violent episodes (Ron says to Sis, &quot;Did you ever have 
   deja-vu?&quot;, to which she replies, &quot;Is that Spanish?&quot;). 
   Roy kills his nurse girlfriend Sylvia (Shannon Absher) by cutting her 
   up with an electric knife (off-screen) and Mom and Sis help him bury 
   her in the backyard. Blade's psychic stripper girlfriend Wanda Dance 
   (Linnea Quigley) shows up at Mom's house and soon Roy/Blade and Wanda 
   scheme to take the money away from Mom (Roy even shoves Mom's hand 
   into the garbage disposal, in the film's goriest effect, to show her 
   who is boss). Mom and Barry (who now knows that Roy is alive) 
   conspire with Wanda to kill Roy to collect a two million dollar 
   wrongful death settlement from the airline, but Roy/Blade beats Barry 
   to death with a baseball bat (off-screen). Sis and her boyfriend 
   Danny (co-director Richard Gabai) try to find a way to get Blade out 
   of Roy's body and even involve themselves with Wanda, who conducts a 
   seance (it turns out badly). After a setback involving pool men (a 
   running joke throughout the film), Sis and Danny, armed with a pipe 
   wrench (!), extract the evil out of Roy with a few twists of the 
   wrist.&nbsp; This impossibly cheap, terribly unfunny horror/comedy is 
   virtually unseen here in the United States (it was never able to 
   acquire a distribution deal). There's a reason for that. It stinks. 
   Co-directors Richard Gabai (<B><A HREF="assault_party_nerds_1989.htm">ASSAULT
    OF THE PARTY NERDS</A></B> - 1989) and Robert Strauss (who also 
   co-wrote the threadbare screenplay with Burford Hauser) have crafted 
   a comedy without any laughs and a horror film without any scares. To 
   prove it to you, here's the best comedy exchange, when Sis and Danny 
   try to figure out a way to get Blade's spirit out of Roy's body: Sis: 
   &quot;The answer lies in that pipe in his stomach.&quot; Danny: 
   &quot;Maybe we should call a plumber!&quot; Pure comedy gold! There 
   are a couple of good instances of gore, such as the garbage disposal 
   sequence and a scene where Roy/Blade cuts off a piece of Mom's tongue 
   with nail clippers, but otherwise it's a pretty dry and dreary 
   affair. Linnea Quigley spends most of her screen time topless or 
   half-dressed, but name a film she was in during the 80's where she 
   wasn't. <B><A HREF="blood_nasty_1989b.htm">BLOOD NA$TY</A></B> (that

   one in your family likes to talk about. It's best kept locked in a

   not remotely scary enough to be considered horror. It's just horribly 
   unfunny. Also starring Karen Russell, Jamie James and Michelle 
   Winding. The end credits contain (obviously) fake crew names and

   This Al Adamson film, made in August of 1966, but not released until 
   1969 (it contains a 1969 copyright when the title is shown), is a 
   real odd duck. Deep down inside you know you should hate it, but it 
   is just so damn goofy, you can't help but enjoy it. This is also the 
   expanded TV version with the pared-down name &quot;<B>Dracula's Castle</B>&quot;
    (the name on the print). In is what an unusual twist, some of the 
   bloodier footage was excised, but a werewolf plot was added to 
   increase the theatrical film's 84 minute running time to a more 
   respectable 91 minutes, so it could fit comfortably in a two-hour 
   time slot. Thanks to Walter Olsen and his Scorpion Releasing company, 
   we are now able to see the full 91 minute version in anamorphic 
   widescreen on DVD, the first time this version was shown on home 
   video in any country. The film opens with young Ana (Vicki Volante; 
   Adamson's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HorrorBloodMonst70">HORROR OF 
   THE BLOOD MONSTERS</A></B> [1965/1970]) driving her 1965 Ford Mustang

   hulking, facially-deformed Mango (Ray Young). Ana faints at the sight 
   of him and Mango carries her away. As the opening credits roll, we 
   look at a castle in the middle of nowhere (actually Shea's Castle in 
   Lancaster, California) while Mango carries Ana inside. Then we get a 
   brief travelogue showing us dolphins and whales doing tricks at the 
   late Los Angeles park Marineland (it closed down in 1987), where 
   professional photographer Glen Cannon (Gene O'Shane) is taking photos 
   of model Liz (Jennifer Bishop; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#HouseOfTerror1972">HOUSE
    OF TERROR</A></B> - 1972; here using the name &quot;Barbara 
   Bishop&quot;) in front of a glass tank where manatees are frolicking 
   underwater. It seems Liz agreed to Glen's proposal to be his wife. 
   After more shots of Glen photographing Liz posing with a walrus, a 
   seal and then in a bikini, a man (Ken &quot;Kent&quot; Osborne, this 
   film's Special Makeup Effects man and director/writer of such films 
   as <B><A HREF="women_unchained_1974.htm">WOMEN UNCHAINED</A></B> - 
   1974) hands Glen a telegram (This is one of the edits in the film, as 
   other reviewers say the telegram is dated 1966, but it is missing 
   here.) that tells him that his Uncle Thomas has died (he was 108 
   years-old!) and Glen has inherited his castle that, for the last 60 
   years, is being leased by the Countess (Paula Raymond; <B><A HREF="beast_from_20000_fanthoms_1953.htm">THE
    BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS</A></B> - 1953) and Count Townsend (Alex 
   D'Arcy; <B><A HREF="horrors_of_spider_island_1960.htm">HORRORS OF 
   SPIDER ISLAND</A></B> - 1960), who is actually... Count Dracula! The 
   Townsends get the same telegram, with the Countess saying that their 
   60 years there were wonderful and she hates the thought of leaving, 
   but the Count tries to cheer her up by telling her that the new owner 
   may offer them a new lease or even sell the castle to them. George 
   (John Carradine; Adamson's <B><A HREF="hells_bloody_devils_1970.htm">HELL'S
    BLOODY DEVILS</A></B> - 1970), the Townsend's butler for many, many 
   years, takes a sample of Ana's blood (She is chained to a dungeon 
   wall and can clearly be seen standing on an apple box because she was 
   too short to reach the shackles!) with a hypodermic needle and 
   injects the blood into a drinking glass. Ana passes out as Mango 
   watches. In true Adamson continuity mistakes that are scattered 
   throughout nearly all his films, George enters the living room with 
   two drinking glasses full of blood for the Count and Countess to 
   imbibe in. George tells them that Ana has Double-0 Positive blood, 
   which is the purest blood there is and the vampire pair are delighted 
   to hear that. The Count talks about getting Johnny 'released&quot; 
   and says he is only trouble when &quot;that damn moon is full.&quot; 
   That's right, Johnny is a werewolf. We then see Johnny (Robert Dix; 
   Adamson's <B><A HREF="satans_sadists_1969.htm">SATAN'S SADISTS</A></B> 
   - 1969) illegally being released from a prison by a crooked guard 
   (John 'Bud' Cardos; this film's Production Manager and director of 
   such films as <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#KingdomSpiders1977">KINGDOM
    OF THE SPIDERS</A></B> [1977] and <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Dark1979">THE
    DARK</A></B> [1979]), who was promised $5,000 for his release, but 
   he has not received it yet. Johnny then turns into a werewolf (using 
   old-fashioned time lapse photography) and kills the guard before he 
   can get the bribe (Don't even try to think how the prison dealt with 
   Johnny's lycanthropy, because you will just go crazy!). The Count and 
   Countess, along with George, pay Ana a visit in the dungeon, where 
   there are three other young women shackled to the wall and the 
   Countess gives Mango Woman #4 (actress identity unknown) as a gift 
   for finding them Ana (we can hear the woman's screams off-screen), 
   while the vampire pair settle into their coffins for the day, asking 
   George to be on the lookout for Johnny (Countess to her husband: 
   &quot;Sweet dreams!&quot;). Johnny, who has now changed into human 
   form because it is daytime, is being chased by a prison posse with 
   the lamest-looking bloodhounds on film (they look like family pets 
   being taken for a walk, while angry barking noises play on the 
   soundtrack), so Johnny kidnaps a girl (Joyce King) who just happens 
   to be sitting on the rocks by the river and then drowns her (Ah, Al 
   Adamson. You have to love him for all the WTF?!? moments in his 
   films). Johnny runs through the water to keep his scent from the dogs 
   and he knocks out a guy (Associate Producer Ewing Brown, who has 
   acted in such films as <B><A HREF="astounding_she_monster_1957.htm">THE

    FROM THE UNKNOWN</A></B> [1958]) who just got done changing a flat 
   tire. He throws the guy in the back seat and steals his car and 
   shotgun, steals the guy's clothes and changes into them (While 
   driving, no less.), stopping long enough to shotgun a male 
   hitch-hiker in the face through the passenger side window to steal 
   his food and clothes! He then drives the car off a cliff with his 
   hostage inside, laughing as he looks at the wrecked car on the rocks 
   below. Johnny is not just a werewolf, he's a full-blown psychopath, 
   too (and damn proud of it). He arrives at the castle and he and 
   George play a game of pool, where George tells Johnny that he was 
   saved by the Townsends a long, long time ago from a &quot;necktie 
   party&quot; (Johnny's description of a hanging) for sacrificing 
   nubile young women to the Great Moon Goddess Luna (which they still 
   allow George to perform up till this day), so he is very loyal to 
   them and will do anything they ask him to. We finally get back to 
   Glen and Liz as they are driving to the castle, Liz saying that the 
   first thing she is going to do is &quot;Go for a swim in the castle's 
   moat. Every castle has a moat!&quot; (Um, Glen, are you sure you want 
   to marry this woman?). When they get to the castle, they meet George, 
   who tells them that the Townsends won't be available until after 
   sunset. When they finally meet the Townsends, Glen mentions that they 
   look very good for people in their 90's (they are actually centuries 
   years-old), but he will have to dispossess them from the castle. Liz 
   wants to live there and &quot;What Liz wants, Liz gets.&quot; The 
   Townsends get the idea of using Johnny to get rid of the new owners 
   (The Countess then makes a throw-away aside that maybe someday 
   synthetic blood will be manufactured and vampires will be welcomed 
   into society, pre-dating the premise of <B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE
    BLOOD</A></B> by 40 years!). That night Glen and Liz hear a woman 
   scream and Liz makes Glen join her to go and investigate (At first, 
   Glen says of the scream, &quot;I think it's probably someone using an 
   electric tooth brush that just got short circuited.&quot; WTF?!?). 
   Johnny is now a werewolf again, outside in the woods chasing some 
   woman (actress unknown), while Liz and Glen go down to the castle's 
   basement when they hear the woman scream again. They meet Mango and 
   run away. George tells them that the screams they heard were probably 
   made by the Townsend's pet toucan, while werewolf Johnny catches the 
   unidentified woman and kills her (off-screen). Will Glen and Liz make 
   it out alive? What happens to the Townsends, Johnny, George and 
   Mango? In the film's final 30 minutes, you'll witness such things as 
   Liz and Glen being chained-up in the dungeon, Ana being sacrificed to 
   the Great Moon Goddess Luna (she is burned alive), Mango being shot 
   at least four times, getting an axe planted in his back and then

   (He dies in the theatrical film version by tumbling down the stairs 
   while wielding a whip, which is missing from this version), but the 
   three other women chained in the dungeon escape, too.&nbsp; I have to 
   confess that I have never seen <B><A HREF="blood_of_draculas_castle_1969b.htm">BLOOD
    OF DRACULA'S CASTLE</A></B> before until I watched the Scorpion 
   Releasing DVD, even though it was shown countless times on TV during 
   the 70's. I just wished they also squeezed the theatrical version on 
   the disc, so we could see the parts that are missing in the TV 
   version, but this is already a <A HREF="hearse_1980_blood_of_draculas_castle_1969_dvd.htm">double
    feature DVD</A> with the 1980 horror film <B><A HREF="hearse_1980.htm">THE
    HEARSE</A></B>. I have seen every other film Adamson has made (and 
   review quite a few of them on this site), but I'll be damned if I 
   don't know why I never saw this one before (Hell, I lost my virginity 
   at an Adamson double feature at a drive-in in 1973, but that's a 
   story for another time). This one also contains the &quot;Adamson 
   charm&quot;, as even though we are shown that the castle is in the 
   middle of the desert, there just happens to be a forest and ocean 
   next to it. Adamson treats the Townsends and their household like a 
   proper everyday family (although a rich family), as no fangs are 
   bared and the two vampires never come off as threatening and act like 
   a civilized couple. They are the exact opposite of what we expect 
   vampires to be. (The screenplay was by Rex Carlton. He was an actor 
   in such films as <B><A HREF="brain_that_wouldn't_die_1962.htm">THE 
   BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE</A></B> [1962; also The Producer] and <B><A HREF="nightmare_in_wax2.htm">NIGHTMARE
    IN WAX</A></B> [1968; also the Screenwriter], who committed suicide 
   in 1968 when he couldn't repay the Mob the money he borrowed to 
   finance a film, possibly this one). You can tell what footage was 
   made for TV, as the film stock used differs from the theatrical film 
   and some of the TV scenes are either underlit or overlit and grainy. 
   My favorite thing about this film is the talent behind the scenes. 
   Cinematographer L&aacute;szl&oacute; &quot;Leslie&quot; Kov&aacute;cs 
   would go on to photograph the ground-breaking <B><A HREF="easy_rider_1969.htm">EASY

    HOUSE WHERE EVIL DWELLS</A></B> (1982). Add to that the 
   aforementioned John 'Bud' Cardos, Ewing Brown and Kent Osborne and 
   you have a film steeped in low-budget genre talent. But what I really 
   found funny was Adamson's cheapness in this production where, instead 
   of showing the Townsends dissolving in the sunlight, the camera pans 
   on Glen's and Liz's face as they describe what is happening. Then we 
   are shown two empty sets of clothes on chairs with spiders crawling 
   over them (At least in this TV version. I can't speak of the 
   theatrical version). The theatrical version was available on

    ORGY OF THE LEATHER GIRLS</A><A NAME="BloodOrgyLeather"></A> (1988) -</B> 
   This no-budget horror comedy (whick looks like it was edited in a 
   moving car by a meth addict going through withdrawal) opens with a 
   montage of unrelated scenes, including footage of a real birth of a 
   baby, a woman rubbing blood over her breasts and a spinning drill bit 
   next to some guy's naked hairy ass, while the on-screen narrator, 
   Detective Joe Morton (Phillip Silverstein), warns us that what we are 
   about to see is &quot;the most bloody series of crimes ever 
   perpetrated by a group of adolescent girls&quot;. We are then 
   introduced to those girls, some of them named Rawhide and Fleabrain. 
   One is a Jewish girl who secretly worships Adolph Hitler (she hides 
   his photos behind an Israeli flag). Another is a religious fanatic 
   who practices bloody self-flagellation. Another is a fan of Western 
   films who masturbates to a photo of John Wayne (her bedroom is 
   plastered with Spaghetti Western posters). The last one is an 
   exercise fanatic who shadowboxes a rubber bat on a string. After they 
   get dressed and stuff weapons in their bras (guns, strait razors), 
   they all congregate, hop into a convertible and drive to their 
   Catholic school. At the &quot;No Girls Allowed&quot; clubhouse, four 
   guys drinking Stroh's discuss bowling and ninjas. We are then 
   introduced to Lenny Rice, &quot;Teen Tycoon of Smut&quot; (Sven-Erik 
   Geddes), a porno filmmaker who shoots rubber darts onto the breasts 
   of his porn actresses while they work out. The Leather Girls attack a 
   guy wearing a &quot;Super Dad&quot; t-shirt and beat him bloody. 
   Rawhide (Melissa Lawrence) then stabs a beat cop to death, stea<A HREF="blood_orgy_of_the_leather_girls_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood orgy of the leather girls album cover medium.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ls
    his gun and eats a piece of of his flesh. We then see a drunk driver 
   run over a baby in a carriage while Detective Morton shows photos of 
   the baby's dismembered hand and rails against drinking and driving. 
   The Leather Girls then throw a bowling ball through the car's 
   windshield and stab the drunk driver to death. When a friend of the 
   Leather Girls is raped at a school dance, they follow the rapist in 
   their car, but lose him. Working on an obscure hunch, the Leather 
   Girls begin a journey of death, killing anyone they think is involved 
   in the rape. As the bodies begin piling up, Fleabrain (Jo Ann Wyman) 
   is given the task of cutting up the bodies and disposing of the parts 
   (people scream when they discover fingers and other body parts on the 
   sidewalk). The girls then chase a guy into a ninja academy (we know 
   it's a &quot;Ninja Academy&quot;, because a hand-painted sign tells 
   us so) and blow everyone away after the ninja teacher makes one of 
   the girls play &quot;Ninja Roulette&quot; (it's the same as Russian 
   Roulette). The girls capture Lenny Rice at a drive-in (where a really 
   bad movie about &quot;perimeter zombies&quot; is playing) and they 
   bring him back to their hideout. After they castrate another guy they 
   are holding there (he screams like a little girl when he wakes up and 
   discovers his pecker is missing), they anally penetrate Lenny's hairy 
   ass with a power drill. The girls then discover that their friend at 
   the dance wasn't raped at all. She simply passed out because she was 
   malnourished! Oops!&nbsp; As you can tell by the above synopsis, this 
   film isn't something you'll see on Masterpiece Theater anytime soon. 
   Filled with flubbed lines, terrible acting, bad sound, lousy 
   camerawork and the aforementioned choppy editing, <B><A HREF="blood_orgy_of_the_leather_girls_1988b.htm">THE
    BLOOD ORGY OF THE LEATHER GIRLS</A></B> is pretty rough going, even 
   though there's plenty of nudity and blood. Director Meredith Lucas 
   (who committed suicide when she couldn't find a distributor for this 
   film!) shoots everything in such a disjointed manner, it's hard to 
   make out what's going on and the script (by Lucas and Sarah Dicken) 
   is full of groan-inducing lines like, &quot;Success is often failure 
   turned inside out.&quot;, coupled with threadbare sets (much of the 
   film is shot against bare walls) and a strange facination with 
   bowling (people fondle bowling trophies, bowling balls and there's 
   endless talk about bowling in general), make this a tough film to sit 
   through. Lucas does try to keep it different, with scenes of a guy 
   picking his nose during sex, cannibalism and acts of depravity, but 
   the whole affair just comes across as an impoverished amateur hour 
   (actually it's 70 minutes long) that would tax even the most patient 
   viewer. The music soundtrack is full of 80's independent bands (The 
   Megatrons, David Nudelman and the Wild Breed [who also play at the 
   school dance], The Pleasure Seekers, Ralph Nielsen &amp; The 
   Chancellors, Myron Lee and the Caddies and The Phantom Surfers) and 
   one of the girls wears a Misfits jacket. A soundtrack album was 
   released on Planet Pimp Records in 1994 by this film's producer, 
   Michael Lucas, as a tribute to his sister Meredith (Michael was also 
   a member of The Phantom Surfers). There's also a really bad LSD trip 
   sequence where a man dances with a guy dressed like an owl. No less 
   than seven people are credited with the camerawork (including 
   underground filmmaker Jon Jost [<B><A HREF="sure_fire_1990.htm">SURE FIRE</A></B>

    RANCH</A><A NAME="Blood Ranch"></A> (2005) -</B> Four friends on 
   their way to the Burning Man Festival pick up hitch-hiker Alex 
   (Daniel O'Meara) on the side of the road and learn when they stop for 
   gas that they are the last car allowed on this road because it is 
   being closed for repairs. Things get worse when a little blind girl 
   at the gas station tells them that they are all going to die. As they 
   continue on their way down the deserted highway, they almost hit a 
   bloody naked woman named Megan (Shalena Hughes) with their car (she 
   throws up on the windshield). The woman is in shock, so they load her 
   in the car and head for the nearest hospital. A mysterious black van 
   then begins chasing them and runs the car off the road. Alex chases 
   the van off with his 9mm automatic, but their car is toast. Jason 
   (Dayton Knoll) stays behind with Megan, while Alex leads the rest of 
   them to look for help. After passing a spooky scarecrow that 
   overlooks some freshly-dug (and smelly) graves, Alex and the group 
   happen upon a ranch called &quot;The Web&quot;, occupied by a 
   long-haired, bandana-wearing creep named Spider (Jim Fitzpatrick) and 
   his silent hulk of an assistant, Mute (Scott L. Schwartz). Almost 
   immediately, Spider and Mute take the foursome prisoner and begin a 
   series of violent, bloody tortures (Why? Who the hell knows, they're 
   hillbillies!). Meanwhile, Jason and Megan have a violent run-in with

    Wells) and his dentally-challenged sidekick Floyd (Nick Machedo), 
   the driver and passenger of the black van. A quick-thinking Jason 
   shoots both of them and they steal the van and begin their search for 
   their friends. Back at the ranch we discover that the place is full 
   of deviants, including a guy named Dart (Robert Ambrose), who throws 
   (what else?) darts into the back of a tied-up man; another guy named 
   Chair (George T. Woods), who wants to use a woman's body parts to 
   make furniture; and a transvestite midget named Dorothy (Joe Gnoffo), 
   who likes to get fucked in the ass by Spider. Jen (Season Hamilton), 
   Jason's sister, manages to escape Spider's clutches and she watches 
   in the shadows as three of Spider's &quot;disciples&quot; slit her 
   friend Val's (Madeleine Lindley) throat. She makes a new friend in 
   hulking half-wit Mask (John Marrott), Spider's brother, but she ends 
   up stabbing him in the back when he gets too excited when she tries 
   to free Alex. Alex tricks Spider into believing that he wants to 
   become one of Spider's disciples and Jason and Megan arrive at the 
   ranch. Spider and Mute will soon learn that city folk can be more 
   dangerous than simple country folk.&nbsp; While nothing but a series 
   of blood and guts gore set-pieces, director Corbin Timbrook (<B><A HREF="#CrackInTheFloor">A
    CRACK IN THE FLOOR</A></B> - 2001) does manage to generate a good 
   amount of suspense from what is obviously a meager budget. The film 
   keeps one-upping itself as it progresses, introducing new members of 
   Spider's clan and their favorite ways to kill. Spider is still the 
   oddest duck of all, though. He has an affinity for opera, lounge 
   music and strange clothing (including red silk pajamas) while he does 
   his killing, whether it is skinning a woman's leg (he then cuts her 
   arm off with a miniature chainsaw) or serving some poor girl her 
   boyfriend's head for dinner (He then hits her over the head with a 
   wine bottle, tells her, &quot;Did you know that I only had two 
   friends in my lifetime? Mute and insanity. And they've both been 
   loyal as hell!&quot; and then graphically rapes her while screaming 
   in her face, &quot;Adore it!&quot;). Jim Fitzgerald goes a little 
   overboard as Spider (Think Bill Moseley with a mouth full of chewing 
   tobacco), but it's obvious that director Timbrook and scripter 
   Antonio Hernandez were going for a <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">TEXAS

    OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> vibe and, besides a few scenes where the 
   limited budget exposes itself (some of the sound effects are wonky), 
   this DTV horror flick is entertaining as well as being very bloody. 
   The row of women being kept prisoner in chickenwire cages, as well as 
   some of the characters (I'm still laughing and repulsed at the sight 
   of the midget transvestite in pigtails!) and well-done effects will 
   keep you on the edge of your seat. I also love how Spider's disciples 
   have simple names that describe their behavior. Mute is a mute (he 
   does speak as he is dying, though), Shotgun carries a shotgun, Mask 
   wears a mask, Chair spends most of his time in a chair, and so on. 
   Even the little midget is given the name Dorothy because he/she is 
   made up to look like the character in <B><A HREF="wizard_of_oz.htm">THE

   include Wayne losing his hat every time the wind blows and during a

    pledges arrive at the house (One of them says, &quot;It looks like a

   bedroom. Linda gives all the girls a list of items they must find 
   scattered throughout the house and, after telling them that the house 
   is haunted, sends them on their search in this &quot;test of 
   maturity&quot;. After falling victim to some of the guys' rigged

   begin losing their lives for real. One of the girls finds a hidden 
   diary that explains the history of the house and Cara (Cjerste Thor) 
   begins seeing flashbacks of the shotgun murders in a mirror. After 
   finding some more items for the scavenger hunt, the girls are hunted 
   down by what seems to be a woman in a white nightgown and a feather 
   boa. Cara is strangled, Laurie (Brigete Cossu) is nailed into a 
   coffin and Ellen (Gretchen Kingsley) and Jim (Randall Walden) are 
   shot to death with a pistol while making love. Linda realizes that 
   this is no longer a joke, but when she gathers the remaining girls 
   together, she finds out (surprise!) that the van has been disabled. 
   When Alice (Shannon McMahon) leaves in the middle of the night by 
   foot to get help, Linda learns the hard way to never trust your 
   boyfriend. When Alice shows up with the cops the next morning, the 
   house is empty and the van works fine. As the police drive away 
   thinking this was all a practical joke, Alice jumps in the van and 
   goes to drive away, unaware that the killer is in the back seat and

    SLAUGHTER MASSACRE</A><A NAME="Blood Slaughter2013"></A> (2013) -</B> 
   With a title like that, this film better deliver, It does in its own 
   way, but it is no gore classic. Ten years ago at a Halloween party in 
   the small town of Havenwood (shades of <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
   [1978], which took place in the town of Haddonfield), someone dressed 
   in a bald rubber monster mask (Actually made from three separate 
   masks) slaughters everyone at the party with his huge knife (It could 
   almost be called a machete which comes close to the favorite weapon 
   of Jason in the <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY THE 13TH</A></B> 
   [1980] films), which was thrown in the honor of Judge Richard 
   Blumstein (Chris Corsi). The police show up and see all the carnage, 
   including sliced faces and dismembered body parts, when Officer James 
   Fincher (Matt W. Cody) finds a girl barely alive (The skin is missing 
   from her back) and the masked killer stabs James in the chest, but he 
   survives.The local news and newspaper nickname the killer as &quot;The
    Ripper&quot;. Ten years later, sometime in the 1980's, The Ripper 
   grabs Suzette (Bridgette Miller) as she is walking down the road 
   listening to her Walkman. The next time we see her, Suzette is 
   topless (there is a lot of nudity in this film, always a plus) with a 
   pentagram drawn on her stomach with human blood. The Ripper then 
   stabs Suzette with his big-ass knife in her stomach and disposes<A HREF="blood_slaughter_massacre_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood slaughter massacre dvd front8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   her body in a nearby polluted lake. Detective Walter Cobb (Byron M. 
   Howard) and alcoholic Detective James Fincher (the officer who was 
   stabbed by The Ripper ten years earlier) are assigned to the case . 
   James is also a divorced father who has a bitch of a wife named Jenny 
   (Melissa Roth), who constantly rags on James that he never comes to 
   see his young daughter. The next victims are babysitter Mari 
   (Charlotte Pines) and her boyfriend Brian (Stephan Amenta) After 
   James and Walter see the carnage, James says The Ripper is back, but 
   Walter (who also showed up at the Halloween Party 10 years ago) 
   strongly disagrees. The Town's Coroner, Ryan (Mike Roche) secretly 
   comes to James with proof that The Ripper is back and he is getting 
   back at the people of the town where something bad was covered-up, 
   resulting in the death of a young girl. Before James can do anything, 
   he gets blind, stinking drunk and shoots at an innocent citizen 
   thinking he is The Ripper. Captain Bracken (Patrick Devaney, 
   keyboardist for an 80's band called &quot;Romeo Penguin&quot; whose 
   songs play on the soundtrack after Devany got the band back 
   together.) kicks James off the Force while The Ripper kills a naked 
   Kristen (Jackie Wolozin) with his big knife while she is taking a 
   shower (a slight nod to Hitchcock's <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> 
   [1960], including showing blood going down the drain), Jenny is 
   kidnapped by The Ripper and kills Walter. Ryan tells James that The 
   Ripper needs seven souls in one night to bring his daughter back 
   while Captain Bracken finds Walter's dead body and puts an APB out on 
   James for the murder of his partner. James finds Jenny tied and 
   gagged to a wall of a warehouse and she tells him to take a look at 
   the wall behind him. It is an altar to The Ripper's daughter with 
   photos of The Ripper's victims hanging on the wall with their faces 
   crossed out. The only photos that are untouched are those of James 
   and of teenager Carla (Carmela Hayslett-Grillo). The Ripper suddenly 
   shows up and kills Jenny but, for some reason, leaves James alone. 
   Carla is having a secret party with her best friend Danielle 
   (Danielle Lenore Calhoun), some of her female friends and, of course, 
   some horny guys. The Ripper beats James to the party and the 
   slaughter begins. One girl finds her boyfriend on the bed with a 
   knife sticking out of his stomach and the The Ripper appears at the 
   bedroom door with a chainsaw and slices up the girl's stomach (Funny 
   how no one downstairs hears the chainsaw or the girl's blood-curdling 
   screams). Both Carla and Danielle witness The Ripper's carnage first 
   hand (one frat boy has a knife thrust under his chin). Ryan shows up 
   to save the girls but The Ripper nearly kills him by stabbing him in 
   the back (This is the type of film where people get injuries that 
   would kill most people, but they get up like nothing happened.) James 
   shows up and discovers all the victims were related to the adults who 
   covered up a hit and run accident by the drunk Judge Richard 
   Blumstein (Now why would a community do that?), the same incident 
   that killed The Ripper's young daughter. The real killer(s) is 
   discovered, James is killed (he was involved in the cover-up, which 
   is probably why he turned to booze) and his daughter is now an orphan 
   and Danielle pumps two shotgun shells into The Ripper, killing him 
   and then sits with Ryan on the front steps of her parent's house. The 
   film was actually made when director/co-screenwriter (with Louie 
   Cortes)/co-producer (with Lindsay Serrano) Manny Serrano (<B><A HREF="theta_states_2016.htm">THETA
    STATES</A></B> - 2016; <B><A HREF="m_is_for_mastectomy_2013.htm">M

    ABCs OF DEATH 2</A></B> [2014]) made 4 faux trailers for a film that 
   never existed and a short 2011 film called <B>THE RIPPER</B> (which 
   is incorporated into this feature-length film) and the creator of The 
   NYC Horror Film Festival convinced them to make a film based on the 
   trailers and the short.. Serrano used the plot of the first three 
   trailers to make this film (We get to see snippets of the faux 
   trailers during the end credits of this New York City-made film. The 
   film hardly gives us a blood slaughter massacre, but plenty of people 
   die (The bloody makeup effects are nothing to write home about, 
   basically showing knives entering and slicing obvious dummy bodies. 
   The more disgusting effects are shown after the slaughter takes 
   place). The screenplay is also very confusing because we never find 
   out whether The Ripper (played by several different people) is real 
   or supernatural. While James is talking to the father of the hit and 
   run that killed his daughter, The Ripper is upstairs killing Carla, 
   yet he seemingly dies when Danielle shotguns him. It just makes no 
   sense at all. The film tries to show its 1980's roots (on the 
   commentary track, the director tells us it takes place around October 
   1984) by having Danielle and Carla going to a sparsely stacked VHS 
   rental store (Where we can see such titles as <B><A HREF="from_beyond_1986.htm">FROM
    BEYOND</A></B>, which throws the director's 1984 time period off by 
   two years since this Stuart Gordon's film was made in 1986!). The 
   video store was actually the closed Queens, NY video store Marquee 
   Video and co-screenwriter Louie Cortes &amp; Serrano stocked the 
   shelves with VHS tapes from their collections. Also seen is a VHS 
   cardboard sleeve of <A HREF="rosemarys_baby_1968.htm"><B>ROSEMARY'S BABY</B></A> 
   (1968) I couldn't make out any more VHS titles because the film was 
   shot on Digital video using the Canon 60D camera and it is obvious 
   that camera operators Louie Cortes and Christian Grillo were not 
   familiar with the camera since it has scenes that start out of focus 
   and some scenes just don't look right (The contrast is too high). 
   Louie Cortes &amp; Lindsay Serrano also co-directed the 
   better-than-normal <B><A HREF="attack_of_the_brain_people_2013.htm">ATTACK
    OF THE BRAIN PEOPLE</A></B> (2013, an 8-part web series turned film,

   winner, this film has many positive points, like lots of female 
   nudity, gallons of blood and it adheres to many 1980's horror film 
   conventions. Some people may consider this amateurish, but they would 
   be missing the whole point of the film. A <A HREF="http://www.wildeyereleasing.com">Wild

    SONG</A><A NAME="Blood Song"></A> (1982) -</B> First off: Yes, this 
   is the film where Frankie Avalon tries to shed his good-guy image by 
   playing an escaped psychotic mental patient named Paul (he saw his 
   Daddy kill his mother and her lover before eating a bullet). The good 
   news is that he actually pulls it <A HREF="blood_song_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood song vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="116" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>off.
    After escaping the asylum, he steals a van (after burying a hatchet 
   in the driver's head) and picks up a female hitchhiker (whom he also 
   kills). The only problem is that high school student and 
   legbrace-wearing gimp Marion (a chubby Donna Wilkes, who would later 
   play the title character <B><A HREF="angel_1983.htm">ANGEL</A></B> 
   [1983] as well as appearing in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Grotesque">GROTESQUE</A></B> 
   [1987]) has psychic visions of his killings and actually watches him 
   bury the female hitchhiker. She also hears Paul playing his homemade 
   flute (that his father made him) while no one else does. Everyone 
   thinks that she is crazy, including her boyfriend Joey (William Kirby 
   Cullen), her abusive alcoholic father (Richard Jaeckel) and the 
   Police Chief (Dane Clark). Before you can say, &quot;I told you 
   so!&quot;, Frankie begins killing all of Marion's friends and family 
   (which Marion sees in visions), saving Marion for last. What link do 
   Frankie and Marion share that makes her have these visions? It seems 
   that both Marion and Paul share a rare blood type and Marion received 
   some of Paul's blood during her stay in the hospital when a drunk 
   Daddy crashed his car with Marion inside, causing her to be a 
   cripple. So why does Paul kill everyone Marion knows? The only thing 
   I could come up with was that Marion wants her father punished so bad 
   for making her a cripple, that Paul picked up her brain waves and she 
   his (I know, it's quite a stretch! Or it could be as simple as Paul 
   wanting to kill Marion because she saw him burying the hitchhiker. 
   The motive is quite confusing.). In the finale, Paul chases Marion to 
   a lumber mill, where she electrocutes and drowns Paul after a 
   forklift he is driving falls into a lake. Is he really dead? Well, 
   the film doesn't make much sense, but it does contain a few 
   underlying themes that aren't usually displayed in films like this. 
   First off, Richard Jaeckel comes off like the father from hell and 
   implies that incest would not be out of the question. He's always 
   harping on Marion that he knows she is having sex with Joey and talks 
   repeatedly about her taking her clothes off. You're actually glad 
   when Paul does him in (while repeating, &quot;You're not my Dad! He 
   Never hurt me!&quot;). Second, even though Paul is psychotic, he 
   comes across sympathetically in some scenes. He seems to be looking 
   for something that he just doesn't quite understand and you can see 
   it in his facial expressions. Director Alan J. Levi (who directed 
   many TV series episodes and some TV films, including the MST3000-parodied
    <B><A HREF="riding_with_death_1976.htm">RIDING WITH DEATH</A></B> 
   [1976] and <B><A HREF="stepford_children_1987.htm">THE STEPFORD CHILDREN</A></B> 
   [1987] and continues to direct today) keeps the proceedings moving at 
   a brisk pace and gives you the favorite 80's shock ending that films 
   of that decade were so proud of. Co-star Lenny Montana (who plays 
   Joey's boss, Skipper) also co-wrote the screenplay and co-produced. I 
   enjoyed this little slice of bloody nostalgia and wished that Frankie 
   Avalon would have branched out after this. Sadly, he didn't (He 
   basically retired from acting save for a few parts here and there, 
   including lampooning his goodie-goodie beach boy image in the 
   well-received <B><A HREF="back_to_the_beach_1987.htm">BACK TO THE BEACH</A></B>

   activities as skinnydipping and making out on the kitchen table. On 
   the first night, they are attacked by a bigfoot-like creature. They 
   manage to fight off the attack but find their car destroyed. Mike 
   (Jerry Albert) decides to walk to town to get some help. He finds the 
   townsfolk a might uncooperative, especially the three hunters he met 
   earlier. They chase him but he eludes capture. The next morning, Mike 
   flags down a deputy and they head for the cabin. They find Mike's 
   wife and the other couple visciously murdered. Mike shoots the

   the hillbilly hunters. The hunters were using the cabin as storage 
   for their illegal poaching operation, using the bigfoot disguise to 
   chase away any unwanted visitors. When the deputy is suddenly 
   murdered, it is up to Mike to get his revenge. This example of 
   regional filmmaking has a few interesting scenes (especially the 
   intercutting of Mike running in slow motion while his wife and the

   whole, is basically a bore. The special effects (a gutted dog, a hand

   born here and his grandmother fell in love with a local doctor (in a 
   village on the island which is no longer there). When his grandfather 
   found out about the affair, he cut his grandmother's head off with 
   the &quot;Marnack dagger&quot;, which hangs on the wall of the castle 
   up to this day. His grandfather then climbed the castle tower and 
   threw himself into the sea. Later, the same thing happened to the 
   Count's father. His mother had an affair with a Protestant priest and 
   when his father found out, he cut her head off with the very same 
   dagger (that must be one sharp dagger!), burned down the village and 
   then threw himself off the tower to his death. The Count goes on to 
   say that every male member of the Marnack family who falls in love is 
   cursed to the same fate. Will history threepeat itself? What do you 
   think? The Count then raises his glass and toasts the ghost of the 
   castle, saying the ghost has a secret it will not reveal. I wonder 
   what that can be?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, Samuel tells Cora that the Count comes from a family of 
   murderers, but Cora tells him to go to bed and leave her alone. The 
   Count pays Evelyn a visit in her bedroom and tells her she looks just 
   like his wife Catherine and this was her bedroom. Evelyn says, 
   &quot;What happened to her? Did you behead her?&quot; and the Count 
   says no, one day she just disappeared. The Count tells Evelyn that he 
   fell in love with her the very first time he saw her in the play and 
   tells her to take her time to love him back, he doesn't need an 
   answer right away. We then discover that Penny and Rosalind are 
   lesbians, as Gregory watches them in action through a peephole in the 
   wall. Gregory then goes to Sybil's bedroom to tell her what he saw 
   and to invite her to come watch (&quot;It's a wonderful sight!&quot;).
    When Sybil refuses, calling him a pig, Gregory rapes her, telling 
   her that there is nothing she can do about it because he knows a 
   secret about her that she doesn't want him to tell the Count. Mary 
   and Carol then try their hand at lesbianism after learning about the 
   habits of Penny and Rosalind, but it is a travesty since Carol is 
   turned off about touching Mary's breasts.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, The Count and Evelyn go for a romantic walk by the 
   sea and kiss (It didn't take Evelyn very long to make up her mind!), 
   while Jefferson watches them and curses the women to an eternity in 
   Hell (he really needs to get laid!). Cora hits on a local young 
   fisherman (an uncredited appearance by our old friend Mike Monty; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#AchtungDesertTigers">ACHTUNG!
    THE DESERT TIGERS</A></B> - 1977) and they have sex in his shack 
   made of straw. Gregory spies on them and when Cora leaves, he enters 
   the shack and slaps the shit out of the fisherman, telling him, 
   &quot;You were born here and you will die here!&quot;, as we discover 
   the fisherman is Gregory's son. Cora enters the castle and tells 
   Samuel that she just fucked a fisherman, ignoring Samuel's hurt 
   feelings. That night, the Count shows everyone the Marnack dagger 
   (it's the biggest dagger I have ever seen) and Evelyn asks him if he 
   has ever used it, the Count answering, &quot;No...not yet&quot; and 
   laughing (I would be out of that castle so fast, my shadow wouldn't 
   be able to keep up with me!). There's a heavy thunderstorm outside 
   and Cora gets drunk, once again putting down Samuel (I don't hit 
   women, but in her case I would make an exception!) and the lights go 
   out in the castle (which is strange, because all the lights are oil 
   lamps!). The Count and Evelyn are making love in his wife's bed 
   (Eww!), while Sybil listens at the door, jealous and calling Evelyn a 
   &quot;no good bitch.&quot; When they are done, the Count leaves the 
   bedroom while Jefferson prays to the &quot;Angel of Vengeance&quot; 
   to kill the women. The next morning, Mary discovers Cora's 
   decapitated head in the yard and the Count discovers her headless 
   body leaning out her bedroom window, with large footprints next to 
   the body (he thinks they are Gregory's). Jefferson then announces 
   &quot;The Dagger of the Marnacks is missing!&quot;. Has the Marnack 
   Curse struck again?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rosalind joins Samuel for a midnight snack since it is impossible to 
   leave the island due to the storm (The Count also tells them that the 
   police can't be contacted for the same reason) and she sees Gregory 
   outside in the rain, acting suspicious. The next morning, we see 
   Rosalind screaming and crying at the bottom of the stairs and 
   everyone finds Penny's decapitated head on her bedroom pillow (Choppy 
   seas or not, I would have been long gone from that castle!). The 
   Count holds a makeshift funeral, burying Penny next to Cora. Is 
   something supernatural going on here, or is it more down to earth? It 
   doesn't take a genius to figure it out but, boy, these women are 
   stupid beyond belief. Rosalind disappears and Samuel discovers her 
   severed head hanging by her hair in the barn. Jefferson tells Carol 
   and Mary that they are safe because the sinful women were executed by 
   the Hand of God, while Sybil tells Evelyn that the Count is 
   &quot;sick&quot; and the Marnack Curse dictates that he can't love 
   anyone without them dying. Evelyn takes her words as gospel and runs 
   away from the Count.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    After the storm ends, the Police Inspector (an uncredited appearance 
   by Luigi Batzella who, as &quot;Paul Solvay&quot;, directed <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil's wedding">THE
    DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT</A></B> - 1973 and <B><A HREF="nude_for_satan_1974.htm">NUDE
    FOR SATAN</A></B> - 1974) arrives and quickly begins to act like 
   Columbo. Samuel confesses that he is the killer saying he killed the 
   women for making fun of him, but is he really the killer? The 
   Inspector then tells the Count that Evelyn is actually his wife 
   Catherine (no surprise there) and begins interrogating everyone until 
   the truth comes out. It seems Gregory turned himself into the police 
   the night before because he couldn't take his guilty conscience any 
   longer. Gregory told the Inspector that Sybil is the killer because 
   she couldn't stand the women &quot;making love everywhere&quot; and 
   felt powerless (WTF?!?). She couldn't stand seeing the Count with any 
   woman, so she tried to kill every woman he looked at. No, she didn't 
   kill the Count's wife, she hypnotized her into believing her husband 
   left her and has kept her hidden all this time in a secret room in 
   the castle (She didn't kill Catherine because she was a friend!). 
   Sybil leads the Inspector to the secret room and we are introduced to 
   Catherine (Patrizia Webley again) and she is crazy as a loon (It 
   seems Evelyn isn't the Count's wife, yet the film doesn't try to 
   backtrack on the Inspector's claim she is!). The film ends with 
   Catherine being shipped off to a mental institution, with the Count 
   saying, &quot;Goodbye Catherine&quot; as he watches her carriage 
   disappear in the horizon. What happened to Evelyn? I'm afraid we will 
   never know. An unusual somber ending to a film racked with guilt.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   fairly quick pace, showing us plenty of female nudity to keep our 
   minds off the absurdities of the plot. There is also some surprising 
   gore on view. While we never see the women lose their heads, we do 
   get to see their noggins after the fact, posed for maximum shock

   is long OOP and hard to find. My review is based on a later DVD 
   release by Redemption, which is the basis for this review. I almost 
   stopped the DVD before I even watched the film, because Redemption 
   opened the film with a shoddily-shot SOV intro that goes on for far 
   too long. We see some topless girls with chainsaws and swords, while 
   a big bosomed woman with fangs (and long fingernails) prattles on and 
   on about something that has nothing to do with this film, even 
   mentioning Cambodian communist revolutionary Pol Pot (!) while

   thinking of watching this for free on Amazon Prime, be aware that the

   started in 1984 and finished in 1991. It shows (The film ends with 
   the following on-screen text: BLOOD SYMBOL 1984-1991 &quot;REST IN

   difference in age and weight from scene to scene (She quit mid-film 
   after having an argument with Devereaux and a stand-in was used, 
   which is why during the latter half of the film only long shots were 
   used in scenes Ms. Richard was to appear in). The film lists at least 
   a dozen photographers and it is easy to spot the different 
   photographic styles throughout the production (Originally shot in 8mm 
   and switching to 16mm when the production got some funding). The 
   film's main distraction is the constant use of hand-held cameras. It 
   produces such a dizzying effect that it induces a severe migraine on 
   the viewer (kind of what </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE

   This practice runs rampant on IMDB (even to the opposite effect,

    they go to a different part of the world to find a legendary monster 
   (and usually faking their findings; real cable is full of these types 
   of shows, where they promise results and then shit in your hand), are 
   in the Pacific Northwest (actually filmed in Butte County, 
   California) to fake a Bigfoot documentary and pass it off as real. 
   But what they run in to is much more dangerous (Can you guess what it 
   is? I bet you can.). The film opens with an off-screen female 
   narrator speaking as if she is narrating a wildlife documentary, 
   saying that animals have come very close to human population due to 
   forest fires or human invasion of their land and they pose a danger 
   to humans if they are not careful. Then we see a cannibal grab a fat 
   kid in a cowboy hat as the female narrator says, &quot;Yes, the 
   hungry pack will eat good tonight!&quot; We are then introduced the 
   the faux documentary team, which includes English host Nigel Thorne 
   (Nathan Anthony Carter); his unwitting guide and tracker Roy (Matthew 
   Corbett Davis), who believes this is a serious show, since he once 
   lost a good friend called Harry Duncan in this part of the forest 
   years ago; cameraman Mark (Darren Courtney); Producer Lindsey (Kate 
   Corey); her personal assistant Jenna (Angie Griffin, who disappears 
   from the film after one scene!) and joker soundman Dave 
   (director/producer/writer/editor/etc. Joshua Siegel). When Roy finds 
   out that this show is nothing but a hoax and says he thought that 
   their Chubacabra episode looked real, Dave replies, &quot;We faked 
   that episode by paying a Puerto Rican boy five dollars to run around 
   in a Halloween costume!&quot; Roy is not amused, and when they find a 
   mute girl in a stream, they try to talk to her, but she takes a bite 
   out of Roy's arm and Roy uses a tranquilizer dart on her so they can 
   take her to the hospital. This, of course, makes the TV News, where 
   reporters show the mute girl's photo onscreen and ask anyone if they 
   know who this &quot;Jane Doe&quot; is to please call the station or 
   the police, and just emboldens Nigel to change the plans on this 
   episode (They are all at a bar, including new female production 
   assistant TJ [Cori Jenab], when Nigel toasts, &quot;To Jane Doe, our 
   first real catch!&quot;). The team goes to the hospital to find out 
   Jane Doe's progress and the doctor tells them that she recently had a 
   baby in the past few weeks and that she also bit two nurses and broke 
   an orderly's wrist. The doctor is also worried about a very virulent 
   strain of meningitis that is in Jane Doe's blood (Roy is beginning to 
   act strange since he has been bitten by her), but an official from 
   the State Mental Health Facility has come to put her in an 
   institution. As she is being put in the van, she bites the official's 
   arm and runs into traffic. Nigel grabs her hand to try and save her, 
   but she is hit by an SUV and dies (all Nigel holds is Jane Doe's 
   severed hand!). It is at that point that Nigel decides he and his 
   team will go back to the forest to try and find the baby and &quot;Big
    Papa&quot;, the man who fathered the baby. Everyone else is against 
   the idea (including Roy, who is acting stranger by the hour), but 
   since Nigel pays the bills, they have no choice but to follow him. 
   Once in the forest, Roy follows Jane Doe's tracks and everyone gets 
   to know him better (He's an Iraq Veteran), while a hipster 
   photographer nearby has his scalp ripped-off and one of two hunters 
   is disemboweled (we watch him playing with his exposed intestines). 
   The second hunter is knocked-out with the butt of his shotgun. The 
   team goes deeper in the woods (where they discover a tree adorned 
   with strange man-made objects) and Mark gives TJ a second camera so 
   she can shoot additional footage, but when she hears Lindsey say, 
   &quot;Nature definitely has a dark side.&quot;, she becomes extremely 
   worried (and rightfully so). As they search for Big Papa (Joe 
   Calavita), they are about to find him and a whole lot more. After 
   they set up camp and jokester Dave farts repeatedly around the 
   campfire (and inside his tent into Mark's face), they awaken in the 
   morning to find human footprints encircling their camp. The second 
   hunter (remember him?), wakes up, flees from the cannibals, falls off 
   a small cliff and then gets eaten alive by the pack of flesh-hungry 
   humans. Nigel stupidly wants to use Lindsey and TJ as bait (TJ nearly 
   was attacked when she ventured into the woods alone earlier in the 
   film), but it is Nigel who becomes Big Papa and his clan's victim 
   when they surround the campsite, disembowel Nigel and tear him apart 
   limb from limb. Roy recognizes one of the cannibals as his long-lost 
   friend Harry Duncan (Chris Madrigal), but Harry doesn't recognize 
   him, so they all head to a cave to hide out, while Roy booby-traps 
   the area (one cannibal has his leg removed at the knee thanks to one 
   of Roy's traps). Dave suddenly goes bonkers and imagines he is 
   covered in ants (previously, Dave mooned the cannibals and Lindsey 
   says, &quot;Dave, don't taunt the cannibals!&quot;), so he runs right 
   into one of Roy's booby traps and has his upper torso severed from 
   the rest of his body. The group gets separated and TJ is nearly 
   devoured by one of the cannibals, but Roy saves her by cutting out 
   one of the cannibal's eyes (Big Papa finds the eye and shoves it back 
   into the cannibal's empty eye socket!). TJ accidentally kills herself 
   when she runs away, trips and impales herself on a protruding tree 
   branch. Lindsay and Mark get away, but not before being bitten, while 
   Roy strips off his shirt, covers his torso in mud and does his best 
   Schwarzenegger impression while growling like a madman and killing 
   the cannibals one-by-one. Mark sacrifices his life so Lindsey can get 
   away, but she is chased by cannibal Big Bad Mama (Carolyn Davidson; 
   the director's mother), where they both fall into a river. Once on 
   the bank, Lindsay bashes Big Bad Mama's face in with a rock until she 
   has no face at all (all we see is the heavy rock sunken into the 
   cannibal's face). Roy fights Big Papa and wins (he takes a huge bite 
   out of Big Papa's neck) and becomes the new leader of the cannibal 
   clan. The finale shows us that Lindsey has been saved but, she too, 
   has become a cannibal. Humans are, indeed, the most deadly 
   animal.&nbsp; While this film starts out humorously enough (it was 
   originally filmed as <B><A HREF="bloodwood_2010.htm">BLOODWOOD</A></B>),
    jack-of-all-trades Joshua Siegel (his only feature film at the time 
   this review was written) ruins the film with his over-reliance on bad 
   CGI for a good number of the kills, even resorting to using it when 
   Lindsey and Big Bad Mama fall into the river! The just-plain bad CGI 
   takes you right out of the film (especially Dave's death, which is 
   simply awful), with CGI blood spurting into the air and 
   badly-rendered body parts flying everywhere. While there are a few 
   practical effects (the scalping, for one), there just aren't enough 
   to make this a film that you must watch. There is some nice scenery 
   and the sequence where Mark and Lindsey must traverse a shaky 
   waterway flume on the side of the mountain does build some suspense, 
   Siegel has definitely bitten off more than he can chew (pardon the 
   pun), which is why he is making short films today. The acting ranges 
   from OK to simply terrible (Nathan Anthony Carter's English accent is 
   especially wonky) and the cannibals are nothing but regular people 
   dressed in tattered clothes, horrible store-bought ogre teeth and bad 
   wigs probably purchased at a Salvation Army store. Seems like the 
   User Ratings on IMDb were right here and the actual reviews are 
   nothing but a bunch of propaganda rubbish. Stay away. Also starring

   of baboons. We first know something is wrong when we see Debbie 
   charging the two boys a quarter each so they can spy on Debbie's 
   sister, Beverly (Julie Brown), dancing topless in her bedroom through 
   a hole in the closet. The three then kill Debbie's father, who 
   happens to be the sheriff, and then make it look like an accident. 
   The only problem <A HREF="bloody_birthday_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloody birthday dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>is
    that neighborhood kid Timmy (K.C. Martel) saw them murder the 
   sheriff, so they must get rid of him, too. Curtis locks Timmy in an 
   abandoned refrigerator and leaves him there, but Timmy escapes and 
   runs to his older sister, Joyce (Lori Lethin). Since he's known as a 
   somewhat untruthful kid, she doesn't believe him. Curtis then shoots 
   stern schoolteacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg) with the sheriff's 
   gun, but Joyce finds the body too soon, so the demonic trio try to 
   run her over with a car, but fail (Did I mention that they're only 
   ten?). Debbie keeps a scrapbook which contains newspaper clippings of 
   their kills, which will be instrumental later on. Joyce, who is 
   heavily into astrology, does astrological charts on the three 
   murderous brats and her findings show that all three, thanks to being 
   born during an eclipse, were born without consciences. Joyce and 
   Timmy have a hard time convincing anyone that these three ten 
   year-olds are responsible for the spate of murders happening in town. 
   As more murders continue, Joyce and Timmy take it upon themselves to 
   bring these three down.&nbsp; Killer kid films are a rare breed.

   subject full-bore. <B><A HREF="bloody_birthday_1981b.htm">BLOODY BIRTHDAY</A></B>

   record straight before I go any further: I find Jesus Franco (or any 
   of his nearly one hundred pseudonyms) and the vast majority of his 
   films to be nothing more than pretentious arty drivel. I've been told 
   by people much smarter than me that I just don't &quot;get&quot; 
   Franco, but I know what I don't like and I fail to see any social 
   significance in films like <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Man Hunter 1980">THE
    MAN HUNTER</A></B> (1980), <B><A HREF="oasis_of_the_zombies_1981.htm">OASIS
    OF THE ZOMBIES</A></B> (1981) or the countless other 
   quickly-assembled pieces of mediocrity that he has been churning out 
   for over 45 years. Sure, some of his earlier films, such as <B><A HREF="awful_dr_orloff_1962.htm">THE
    AWFUL DR. ORLOFF</A></B> (1962), <B><A HREF="diabolical_dr_z_1966.htm">THE

    IN FURS</A></B> (1969) were efficient and moody little thrillers, 
   but as he became more experienced behind the camera (especially with 
   the zoom lens), he became less interested in what was in front of it. 
   I enjoy watching a Franco film as much as hammering nails into my 
   scrotum. If that's not clear enough for you, let me make it clearer: 
   I would rather watch the entire libraries of Andy Milligan, Ed Wood 
   and Al Adamson combined than to watch one faux arty Franco flick. 
   Which brings us to <B><A HREF="bloody_moon_1981b.htm">BLOODY MOON</A></B>,
    Franco's stab at the slasher genre. The opening shots, which are <A HREF="bloody_moon_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloody moon dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>hard
    camera zooms of the Moon and various extreme close-ups of peoples' 
   faces, followed by a psycho with a burned face donning a Mickey Mouse 
   mask (Where are the Disney lawyers when you need them?) killing a 
   poor young, half-naked girl with a pair of scissors, clue us in what 
   to expect next. Years pass and the killer, Miguel (Alexander 
   Waechter), is released from a mental hospital into the custody of 
   sister Manuela's (Nadja Gerganoff) care. A series of brutal murders 
   begins at the palatial home of Miguel and Manuela's rich aunt (she is 
   burned to death in her bed) and then at Alvaro's (Christoph 
   Moosbrugger) new language school (where Manuela is a student), all 
   coinciding with Miguel's return. The list of red herrings is 
   tremendous, as Alvaro's school isn't financially sound, Manuela was 
   hated by her dead aunt (and her fortune goes to Miguel only) and 
   student Angela (Olivia Pascal) has shown up for classes a week late, 
   but won't tell anyone why. It doesn't help that Miguel (and his 
   deformed face) skulks around the school and the surrounding 
   buildings, especially since one of the buildings is where the poor 
   girl was viciously stabbed years before. It also doesn't help that 
   Miguel and Manuela have been carrying-on an incestuous relationship 
   for many years and she wishes that everyone would &quot;just 
   disappear&quot; so they can't judge their sexy love for each other. 
   When students begin getting murdered by someone wearing black gloves, 
   all evidence points to Miguel, but that would be too easy, right? Eva 
   (Ann-Beate Engelke) is murdered in Angela's bed (a knife is shoved 
   through her back until the blade exits out of one of her nipples), 
   but when Angela brings Antonio (Peter Exacoustos) back to her room to 
   view Eva's body, it has disappeared and everyone thinks she's crazy. 
   Angela gets a threatening tape in Spanish language class where a 
   voice threatens to cut her into pieces with a hacksaw, but when 
   Alvaro listens to the tape, it's nothing but normal class tutorial. 
   Angela searches for Eva's body around town and spots Antonio in a 
   compromising position with Manuela and nearly gets crushed by a giant 
   (obviously paper mache) boulder as well as almost being bitten by a 
   poisonous snake. Angela is convinced that Antonio is trying to kill 
   her, but a retard who has had half his brain removed could see it is 
   someone else. Inga (Jasmin Losensky) is tied to a marble block by the 
   killer and has her head cut off with a rock saw (The film's best 
   scene). A little boy witnesses the murder, but the killer runs him 
   over with a car. After several more close calls on her life, Angela, 
   with the help of Miguel (who get a hairbrush handle shoved through 
   his neck for his trouble), is able to unmask Manuela and Alvaro as 
   the killers, but will she survive the night?&nbsp; There's not much 
   more I can say about this by-the-numbers slasher/giallo film, except 
   that Rayo Casablanco's illiterate screenplay could have been written 
   on a napkin, the English dubbing is horrendous (it's not even lousy 
   enough for a laugh) and Franco's direction is full of his usual weird 
   camera angles (he likes to shoot a lot from overhead here), false 
   scares (yes, a cat does jump into frame to scare our heroine) and 
   zooms galore. There are a few bloody bits of gore, but it's nothing 
   you haven't seen a hundred times before (rock saw decapitation 
   excluded). Even the frequent nudity on display can't save this boring 
   piece of tripe and devout Francophiles list this as one of his minor 
   films, so why should you have to suffer through it? Also starring

    MOVIE</A><A NAME="Bloody Movie"></A> (1988) - </B>Twenty years after 
   Hollywood legend Lance Hayward (John Ireland) mysteriously disappears 
   in a fire, his dilapidated mansion is the site of a series of brutal 
   murders which mirror Hayward's old silent films. The film opens with 
   one visiting lawyer being torn graphically in two after being tied to 
   a car and a tree by some unknown killer wearing a black fedora with a 
   white hatband. Immediately after that, another lawyer, played by Dan 
   (billed as &quot;Daniel&quot;) Haggerty, is run-through with a spear 
   (readers of this site know that this was the high point of my night, 
   me being such a big &quot;fan&quot; of Haggerty). Six obnoxious teens 
   decide to party at the mansion after seeing a story about Hayward on 
   TV. They are joined by stoner biker Angel (Jimi Elwell), his chick Jo 
   (Michelle Bauer) and Captain <A HREF="bloody_movie_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloody movie aka terror night dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Ned
    (Aldo Ray), a drunken bum who lives on the mansion grounds. Captain 
   Ned is then dispatched with a hook to the head by someone dressed as 
   a pirate. As the teens search through the mansion playing dress-up 
   and fooling around with the various movie props scattered throughout 
   (including a bit with an out-of-place robotic hand, which seems to 
   have been put there just to show off it's &quot;wow&quot; factor 
   since it's never heard from again), the unknown killer begins 
   murdering them one-by-one. The first guy gets shot with several 
   arrows by the killer (dressed as Robin Hood). One of the girls is 
   decapitated by a sword swung by Ali Baba. The remaining kids find a 
   huge locked vault which they hope holds Hayward's long-lost fortune. 
   It turns out that the vault contains the original nitrate negatives 
   of every film Hayward made as well as his hidden fortune. Another 
   girl then falls into a pit of stakes and is impaled after being 
   chased by a Great White Hunter. Another guy has his hand chopped off 
   by a knight in armor carrying an axe. Angel and Jo are killed by 
   Zorro (by sword and whip). With only two members left, can nerd Chip 
   (William C. Butler of the <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1990.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> remake) figure a way out of this mess and 
   unmask the killer? While basically a showcase for some bloody 
   killings, this film, originally known as <B><A HREF="terror_night_1988.htm">TERROR
    NIGHT</A></B> (available on DVD in Canada under that title), was 
   also the last film partially directed by Andre De Toth (<B><A HREF="house_of_wax.htm">HOUSE
    OF WAX</A></B> - 1953), yet he receives no on-screen credit except 
   for a &quot;Thank You&quot; in the end credits from director/producer 
   Nick Marino (who cut his teeth co-directing parts of John Saxon's <B><A HREF="death_house_1987.htm">DEATH
    HOUSE</A></B> in 1987). The final 25 minutes of the film seem 
   forced, as if the film came up short and more scenes had to be filmed 
   to make the running time feature length.&nbsp; John Ireland (who 
   really only appears at the end) looks embarassed and the revelation 
   of him actually being the killer is a cheat because it's apparent 
   that other people (including Fred Olen Ray staple Jay Richardson) are 
   playing him throughout the rest of the film. Also unbelievable is the 
   fact that six teens would be such fans of Hayward's silent films and 
   know all the lines (Hold on now. There's spoken dialogue in silent 
   films? I'm confused!). The film also has an inordinate amount of B 
   actors (including Cameron Mitchell as a detective and Alan 
   &quot;Skipper&quot; Hale as a night watchman), whose only role is to 
   say a line or two of dialogue and die. On the positive side, there 
   are a few juicy kills (the opening torn-in-half murder is especially 
   bloody) and Michelle Bauer has a fairly graphic nude scene, which is 
   always a plus in my book. The showing of Hayward's (fake) movie 
   posters before each kill is also a novel idea. Kenneth J. Hall (<B><A HREF="evil_spawn_1987.htm">EVIL

   Placid Pines ready for it's summer opening. After scaring each other 
   with tales of camp serial killer Trevor Moorehouse around a campfire, 
   they all play a game of Bloody Murder and Jason Hathaway (Justin 
   Martin) plays a practical joke on Tobe (Patrick Cavanaugh), where he 
   dresses as Trevor and threatens Tobe with an axe. Later that night, 
   Jason disappears after screwing Whitney (Tracy Pacheco) in the woods 
   and girlfriend Julie (Jessica Morris) grows worried when he still 
   doesn't show up in the morning. Later on that day, Whitney is stabbed 
   to death in the pantry by the hockey mask killer. The list of

   ex-girlfriend Whitney fucking Jason in the woods (and tries drowning 
   her in the lake a short time later to teach her a lesson); Brad

    who was a rival of Jason's when they were in high school and the bad 
   blood is still there; Patrick (Peter Guillemette), the person in 
   charge of getting the camp in shape; Drew (Christelle Ford), a girl 
   with anger issues (and the biggest toes I've ever seen on a woman!); 
   and Henry (Bob Stuart), an old crazy man that tells Julie a couple of 
   times that &quot;Nelson has come back to even the score!&quot; Crazy 
   Henry seems to know Julie's father and tells Julie to ask him about 
   Nelson. Julie emails her Dad and asks him about Nelson and he replies 
   that he never heard of him (an obvious lie). When Brad is shot and 
   killed by a couple of arrows by the killer and disappears, the police 
   are called in and they suspect the still-missing Jason. Dean is the 
   next to be murdered when his throat is slit and his back impaled with 
   a garden claw. When Jason resurfaces and is arrested by the cops, 
   everyone but Julie believes the killings are over with. When we see 
   Doug (William Winter) get killed by a lawn dart to the chest, we know 
   Julie is correct. Julie's father comes for an unannounced visit, the 
   real killer reveals himself (it's a cheat) and chases Julie through 
   the woods (She races right by an axe, but the killer has the brains 
   to pick it up). Drew (who Julie incorrectly thinks is the killer) 
   ends up saving her life by shooting the killer in the shoulder. The 
   sheriff asks the killer why he killed Doug, but when he replies that 
   he didn't, we then realize that there's a second killer in the camp. 
   Could it be Trevor Moorehouse?&nbsp; Do you smell that? It reeks of a 
   rip-off and you'll believe someone ripped a nasty smelly one after 
   watching this turd. Director Ralph Portillo (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#One Of Them">ONE
    OF THEM</A></B> - 2003) builds zero suspense and the script, by John 
   R. Stevenson (who, surprisingly also wrote the sequel's excellent 
   script), is nothing but tired, old horror movie cliches that offers 
   plenty of red herrings, even if a blind man could spot the killer a 
   mile away (Patrick's actions and facial expressions when Julie 
   mentions Nelson's name is a dead giveaway). The acting and dialogue 
   are pathetic as are the situations the characters must endure (Such 
   as the camp's obstacle course, which rivals anything that the Marine 
   Corps. has!). There's not much to enjoy here, as the gore is tame, 
   there's only one instance of nudity and whenever there's an email or 
   letter shown on-screen (which is often), the person that wrote it is 
   heard reading it out loud, as if they were in the same room as the 
   person reading it. It's annoying and should have been fixed during 
   the looping process, but I don't think this film had a budget big 
   enough to allow for looping. <B><A HREF="bloody_murder_2000b.htm">BLOODY

    it's still a bloody good show. Five years after the events of the 
   first film, a group of camp counselors are closing down Camp Placid 
   Pines for the winter and, while getting drunk around a campfire one 
   night, decide to play a game of &quot;Bloody Murder&quot; (which 
   seems to be a variation of Hide and Seek). After scaring new member 
   James (Lane Anderson) with tales of camp serial killer Trevor 
   Moorehouse (this camp's version of Jason Voorhees) and playing a 
   prank on him, James is brutally murdered (both his legs are cut off 
   with a machete and his head is squashed like a melon with a boulder) 
   by someone dressed as Trevor. Or has Trevor returned? Counselor Tracy 
   Hathaway (Katy Woodruff), whose brother Jason (Tyler Sedustine; a 
   different actor than the first film) disappeared five years earlier 
   at the camp during Trevor's killing spree and is presumed dead, is 
   having nightmares about Trevor and, when she spots Trevor with her 
   binoculars walking through the woods, she can't get anyone to believe 
   her, including boyfriend Mike (Kelly Grunning). Trevor then goes on a 
   murder spree, first killing Ryan (Tom Mullen) with a crossbow bolt to 
   the neck. As the camp counselors go missing one-by-one, Tracy still 
   has a hard time convincing the remaining people that <A HREF="bloody_murder_2_2002.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloody murder 2 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>there's
    a major problem, especially since Rick (Arthur Benjamin), who is in 
   charge of closing down the camp, has an explanation for every 
   disappearance. To complicate matters, Mike screws around with Angela 
   (Tiffany Shepis, who gets naked a lot) and she finds Ryan's dead body 
   half-buried in a shallow grave. The police are called in and everyone 
   at the camp are considered suspects. Mike ends up M.I.A. and Elvis 
   (Raymond Smith) is viciously knifed and killed by Trevor while the 
   police are standing guard outside. Mike is now considered the primary 
   suspect when Trevor's mask is found in his cabin. When Tracy finds 
   some video evidence that points to Mike's guilt and he's finally 
   arrested, both Tracy and Angela still think he's innocent and they're 
   right. Using information found on Rick and Ryan's pagers, Tracy, 
   Angela and Sophie (Amanda Magarian) try to figure out who the real 
   killer is. Problem is, the real killer won't stop until they are all 
   dead. While Tracy gathers evidence that points the finger at Rick 
   (she's wrong), Angela takes a machete to the face and Sophie is 
   knocked unconscious by the real killer. When the sheriff kills Rick, 
   everyone thinks the killings have stopped, until the real killer 
   reveals himself to Tracy on the ride back to civilization. A surprise 
   ending reveals that there is more than one killer stalking the 
   camp.&nbsp; Viewed strictly as a stalk &quot;n&quot; slash film, <B><A HREF="bloody_murder_2_2002b.htm">BLOODY
    MURDER 2</A></B> is a lot of fun but, thankfully it also works on a

   For once, all the girls get along with each other (Tracy and Angela

   acting by everyone is quite good. The finale leaves it wide-open for 
   another sequel (A 2006 production, titled <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Graveyard2006">THE

   slasher films and is a marked improvement over the original. Please 
   do not judge this based on that film. If you have held off seeing the 
   sequel based on the utter crappiness of the original, do yourself a

   God knows that I try to give no-budget horror films like this a lot

   low budget as you can get and still call it a movie. There's

    film is directed/produced/written and lead-acted (among other jobs) 
   by the same person, J.G. 'Pat' Patterson Jr., it's quite obvious who 
   is to blame. The story is simple (maybe &quot;simpleton&quot; is a 
   better word): Dr. Donald Brandon (portrayed by Patterson, using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Don Brandon, America's No. 1 Magician&quot;) loses 
   his beloved wife Anitra (Jenny Driggers) in a car accident (since 
   this is a low budget film, we don't actually witness the accident, we 
   just hear about it), so he, along with his mute, stogie-chomping 
   hunchback assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), go about creating a whole 
   new Anitra using the body parts of other women, onto which Dr. 
   Brandon intends to insert his wife head as the final step. At first, 
   Dr. Brandon and Greg rob graveyards for their body parts, but when 
   those extremities aren't fresh enough to be revived (he wraps them in 
   tin foil and zaps them with electricity like they were yesterday's 
   leftovers), he begins hypnotizing young women, bringing them to his 
   laboratory and cutting off the body parts that he finds 
   &quot;perfect&quot;. Greg simply disposes of the unused parts in the 
   handy acid bath pit Dr. Brandon has in his lab. After killing enough 
   women for parts, Dr. Brandon creates the &quot;perfect&quot; (his 
   favorite word) woman. The only problem is, she's horny as hell and 
   hits on every man she sees (even Greg, who Dr. Brandon kills by 
   planting a meat cleaver in his hump!). This drives Dr. Brandon over 
   the edge. He ends up in a looney bin (It looks more like a prison. 
   Since when do looney bins have iron bars for doors?), reliving all 
   the horrific moments of his life in his deranged mind, still dreaming 
   about the perfect woman. His creation (who walks around in nothing 
   but a bikini) gets picked-up on the side of the road by some horny 
   guy in a beat-up van. I have the feeling that she's going to be more 
   than he can handle.&nbsp; I really can't describe how awful this film 
   is, not to mention how illogical the whole story plays out. One first 
   has to wonder where Dr. Brandon found a hunchback assistant named 
   Greg. Did he have him before his wife died or did he advertise for 
   one after she kicked the bucket? If he had Greg before his wife died, 
   what exactly did he do for the doctor? Trim his hedges? Cook his 
   meals? One also has to wonder how Dr. Brandon picked up that 
   marvelous skill of hypnotizing women without uttering a word. All he 
   does is look at them and the next thing you know, they're on his 
   operating table having their limbs removed without t<A HREF="doctor_gore_1973c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/doctor gore vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>he

   so damn boring. It's nothing but long stretches of tedium interrupted 
   by some scenes of extremely fake-looking gore, which was also 
   supplied by Patterson. I do have to admit that there were two 
   instances in this film where I laughed out loud, even if it was for 
   the wrong reasons. The first instance was where Dr. Brandon and Greg 
   finished their first unsuccessful experimant and we hear a big 
   booming knocking sound on the soundtrack. Dr. Brandon turns to Greg 
   and says, &quot;Get that, it might be the door.&quot; What they hell 
   else could it be? Large woodpeckers? The second instance comes again 
   when someone knocks on the door. It's the middle of the night and 
   when Dr. Brandon opens the door, it cuts away to a hick sheriff 
   obviously standing in the middle of a field during the day asking if 
   everything's OK and making sure nothing illegal is going on. It's 
   apparent that this clip came from an entirely different film 
   (probably some regional moonshiner flick). It's hilarious in it's 
   ineptitude. I wish I could say the same thing about the entire film 
   but, unfortunately, it's just a boring mess. A lot of people think 
   H.G. Lewis had something to do with this film since filmed an 
   introduction for it on the old United Home Video VHS edition (under 
   the <B><A HREF="doctor_gore_1973c.htm">DOCTOR GORE</A></B> title), 
   but the fact is Lewis never viewed the film before he filmed the 
   introduction. Even by Lewis standards, this film is a dud. A lot of 
   reference books claim that Patterson committed suicide when he 
   couldn't obtain a theatrical release for this film, but they are 
   wrong. He did obtain a regional theatrical release through 
   distributor Variety Films, the same company responsible for 
   distributing the ultra-sick rape porno flick <B><A HREF="forced_entry_1972.htm">FORCED

   This Wisconsin-lensed regional turd opens with a dynamite fisherman 
   being pulled under the water while a white-haired witch woman watches 
   on shore. After the credits (and a cringe-inducing love song), we are 
   introduced to a couple of obnoxious vacationing fishermen who go to 
   the lake with their equally obnoxious wives. After some drinking, bad W.C.<A HREF="bog_1978_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bog vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Fields imitations and some lame sex jokes, the wives are pulled under 
   the water by a creature (we only see it's huge claw). The guys run to 
   the local sheriff (Aldo Ray) and the town sawbones (Marshall 
   Thompson) and a search party is formed. The women's bodies are found 
   floating in the water totally drained of blood. The town's coroner 
   (Gloria De Haven) says, &quot;Is it possible we have a Dracula out 
   there?&quot; More people turn up dead in the same condition 
   (including a local cop) and the two (non-grieving, but mad) husbands 
   decide to get some payback on their own. They are introduced to the 
   wotch woman, Adrianne (Gloria De Haven again in tons of old-age 
   makeup), who tells them the creature was awakened by the dynamite 
   fisherman. The coroner theorizes that the creature is some sort of 
   insect as yet undiscovered. The rest of the film is just a poor 
   mixture of romance between the doctor and the coroner, the feeble 
   attempts of the sheriff to do one thing right and everyone trying to 
   find a way to capture it, none of it very interesting. If you're not 
   asleep before the film is over, you're probably not human (or 
   trippin' on meth).&nbsp; God, shoot me now! This boring piece of 
   PG-rated trash has nothing to recommend, except for the cast of 
   veterans, who all (yes, even Aldo Ray) look like they would rather be 
   getting a root canal than to be here. Director Don Keeslar (<B><A HREF="capture_of_grizzly_adams_1982.htm">THE
    CAPTURE OF GRIZZLY ADAMS</A></B> - 1982) has the cast spout a bunch 
   of gibberish (script by Carl N. Kitt) and there are long stretches 
   where absolutely nothing happens. Add to that a severe lack of blood, 
   violence or nudity. So what's the point? It's like a throwback to all 
   those 50's monster-on-the-loose flicks, minus any excitement or 
   sense. You'll know what I mean if you're ever forced to watch this 
   (oh yes, you will be forced!). I think this is the film that turned 
   Also Ray into an alcoholic. When he says, &quot;I need a drink!&quot; 
   about halfway through, it's the film's only believable moment. 
   There's a reason he runs directly into the claws of the creature a 
   few minutes later. He had a moment of clarity. When we finally do get 
   a look at the creature (played by Jeff Schwaab), it looks almost 
   exactly like the one in Larry Buchanan's <B><A HREF="curse_of_the_swamp_creature_1966.htm">CURSE

   named Alley (Deborah Rose) that retired from helping police after 
   seeing too many children being killed by psychos. So when detectives 
   Jersey Callum (Ed Nelson) and Gordon Mullin (Jim Eustermann) go to 
   Alley's house to ask for her <A HREF="boneyard_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/boneyard vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>help
    in a strange case of three dead decaying children found locked in a 
   room in a funeral home with pieces of half-eaten human flesh nearby, 
   she initially refuses. But after a strange nightmare, Alley changes 
   her mind and meets Jersey and Gordon at the morgue (the 
   &quot;boneyard&quot; as it is fondly called by everyone that works 
   there) to look at the three children and try to get a reading from 
   them. The reading she gets is not a good one. These three children 
   are actually ghouls which spring back to life and start chomping down 
   on the populace of the morgue, which includes the strict Mrs. 
   Poopinplatz (Phyllis Diller minus her wig in a mostly serious role), 
   the lead coroner Shepard (the late Norman Fell in a ponytail!), a 
   failed female suicide Dana (Denise Young - who nearly gets sliced 
   open by Shepard during her autopsy!) and all the rest of the 
   characters. This film starts out slowly, building relationships 
   (especially between Jersey and Alley and Gordon and Dana) that 
   actually mean something to the viewer. When all hell breaks loose in 
   the morgue and people start getting eaten by these ghoulish children, 
   we actually care about what happens to them. First-time director and 
   special effects expert James Cummins understands this and builds 
   suspense where most films of this type are only interested in killing 
   people as fodder for the viewer. Alley's weight problem does come 
   into play towards the end of the film and I found myself rooting for 
   her to get the hell out of her predicament. There's plenty of blood 
   and guts for the fans of gore and some funny transformation scenes 
   (especially Mrs. Poopinplatz and her pet poodle, who eats some of a 
   dead ghoul), but Mr. Cummins understands that the meat should be in 
   the story and not mostly splattered across the screen. He should be 
   congratulated for that. James Cummins (who died in December 2010 at 
   the age of 51) wrote and directed two other films: <B>DARK:30</B>

   Silver City on the map, making it one of the richest cities in the

   experts Brian Deering (John Crawford; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Severed Arm">THE

   mine to take a cursory look and report on its condition. While Dan 
   checks the stability of the wood support beams and nearly causes a 
   cave-in (<B>Mark:</B> &quot;You smell anything?&quot; <B>Roger:</B> 
   &quot;No, why?&quot; <B>Mark:</B> &quot;I just shit my pants.&quot;), 
   Mark and Roger string-up lights and set up the generator to get a 
   clearer view of the inside of the mine. Brian and Dan use dynamite to 
   clear an obstruction in the mine and everyone calls it a day, but 
   long-time Silver City resident (it isn't much more than a ghost town 
   now, with a few residents, a bar and a restaurant to sustain it) old 
   man Greenwalt (Jon Lormer) knows that the dynamite blast has just 
   released an evil sitting dormant since 1912. That night, resident 
   Martha Chapman (Marcia Reider) crashes her car into a snow bank after 
   nearly hitting a deer (she has a bumper sticker on the back of her 
   car that says &quot;I Brake For Animals&quot;) and ends up walking to 
   the house that she is getting ready for Mark and Roger to live in 
   while they work the mine. She goes down to the basement to retrieve 
   some supplies because she is going to have to spend the night since 
   she can't get a tow truck until morning, but she's never going to 
   live that long. After hearing a noise in the basement and then going 
   to sleep in one of the bedrooms, she hears the noise again and 
   investigates, but something grabs her in the kitchen and drags her 
   down to the basement. Dan, Mark and Roger clear a cave-in in a 
   section of the mine that is not on their map and discover a natural 
   cavern, complete with lake and the bones of at least thirty people, 
   all stacked in a pile on one side of the lake. Meanwhile, Roger's

   unable to get hot water for a bath, she (gulp!) goes down to the 
   basement to light the pilot on the hot water heater, but she is saved 
   from certain death when Tiger chases her upstairs (the dog knows 
   something is wrong). While Roger and Jessica are trying to have sex 
   (a running joke throughout the film has Roger and Jessica being

   get to know each other and hit it off. They are paid a visit by

   hustles Brian and Dan at pool and Roger goes to the house by himself 
   because he has to get up early to pick up updated maps in another 
   city. Roger is killed by one of the creatures when its clawed 
   tentacles slash him across his neck and drags him away (this is the 
   first time we even see a part of the creatures). To make a long story 
   short (and not give away the manner of the other deaths), Trish, who 
   is a reporter, does some digging in the Silver City newspaper 
   archives and discovers that old man Greenwalt is the son of the only 
   survivor of the 1912 cave-in and has seen the creatures, but no one 
   believed him. In the finale, only Mark and Trish are alive and they 
   are stuck in the mines fighting the creatures with the only weapon

   know, those black creatures that drag away Tony Goldwyn in the 
   finale? Unfortunately, that film came nearly 30 years too late to 
   make a difference (although I still find it difficult to watch those 
   scenes). Which brings us to <B><A HREF="boogeyman_2004b.htm">BOOGEYMAN</A></B>.
    Poor Tim (Barry Watson) still has a hard time forgetting that the 
   Boogeyman killed his father by dragging him into Tim's bedroom 
   closet. Since his body was never found, everyone (but Tim) thinks his 
   father abandoned the family. Now an adult, Tim must return to his 
   childhood home (his mother has died) and face his fears. The more 
   time Tim spends in the house, the more we begin to question Tim's 
   sanity. Is everything that is happening in the house all in his mind 
   or is it real? Childhood neighbor Kate (Emily Deschanel of <B><A HREF="bones_tv_series_2005.htm">BONES</A></B> 
   [2005 - 2017]), who Tim hasn't seen in over 15 years, tries to help 
   him sort it out. And what about that backpack full of missing 
   children posters? Has Tim stumbled into something more nefarious than 
   even he could dream of? I'll leave those questions for you, the 
   viewer, to answer. Not since <B><A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B> 
   (1982) have closets been used so effectively.&nbsp; This is by no 
   means a great film, but people who had to deal with their own 
   personal demons when they were kids should get a shiver or two. Since 
   this is a psychological tale, the PG-13 rating doesn't hurt it at 
   all. There are more than a couple of good scares here, as the 
   scratches on my arm will attest, the result of my wife grabbing a 
   hold of it firmly on several occasions while watching this. Director 
   Stephen Kay (<B><A HREF="get_carter_2000.htm">GET CARTER</A></B> - 
   2000; <B><A HREF="cell_213_2014.htm">CELL 213</A></B> - 2011) offers 
   no comedy here (a welcome relief) and instead only gives us a pretty 
   good &quot;is he or isn't he&quot; scenario (screenplay by Eric 
   Kripke, Juliet Snowden and Stiles White) that's very somber in tone, 
   which is quite refreshing. My favorite line comes when Tim tells a 
   little girl how to combat the Boogeyman: &quot;When you're afraid, 
   close your eyes and count to five.&quot; She just looks at him and 
   says, &quot;What happens when you get to six?&quot; If you're like 
   me, you don't ever want to have that answered. For a change, the 
   deleted scenes and alternate ending on the DVD are worthwhile and 
   change the film's direction if director Kay would have chosen to do 
   so, although it looks like, by the unfinished alternate ending (bad 
   opticals in the final tracking shot), that he made his mind up before 
   shooting finished. There's a small treat for those who watch the 
   entire end credits. Worth a look. Produced by Sam Raimi and Bob 
   Tapert. Also starring Lucy Lawless (who is unrecognizable here) and 
   Skye McCole Bartusiak. Followed by two unrelated sequels: <B><A HREF="boogeyman_2_2007.htm">BOOGEYMAN

   sub-standard stalk 'n' slash yarn about a scientist named Dr. Leech

   it has very serious side effects if not used properly. The subject

    accident and is now confined to a wheelchair. Mr. Deaver buys the 
   formula from Dr. Leech, but before he tries the formula on himself, 
   he has his two dastardly hired hands, Krendal (Wendy Anderson) and 
   Wilkes (Simon Northwood), beat the crap out of Dr. Leech, shoot him 
   in both legs, inject him with a mega-dose of his own formula and lock 
   him in the tunnels of and abandoned government facility. They plan on 
   returning twenty-four hours later to see if the formula worked, but 
   since they forgot to leave him any nutritional serum, Dr. Leech 
   starts to get very, very hungry, begins eating rats and dogs and 
   transforms into a creature who takes on the form of whatever it 
   devours, basically proving that old adage &quot;You are what you 
   eat.&quot; And wouldn't you know it, a quartet of workers, headed by 
   Vince Stoker (&quot;name&quot; actor Tom Sizemore; <B><A HREF="relic_1997.htm">THE
    RELIC</A></B> - 1997) and his partner Otis (Martin Roach), arrive at 
   the building to clean it up and become trapped in the tunnels. They 
   must not only contend with the creature, they also must avoid Krendal 
   and Wilkes, who have returned to check on Dr. Leech's progress. You 
   can probably guess what come next, as Vince tries to protect niece 
   Sam (Amber V. Cull), who was just hired on her uncle's crew, while 
   the creature begins chowing-down on the cast and gaining intelligence 
   as well as nourishment. Ho-hum. It's even got the prerequisite 
   downbeat ending that all these modern-day DTV horror films seem to 
   love, setting it up for a sequel no one in their right mind would 
   ever ask for.&nbsp; This is the freshman directorial and scripting 
   debut of Randy Daudlin, who got his start supplying makeup effects on

   Unfortunately, <B>BOTTOM FEEDER</B> is generic &quot;monster on the 
   loose attacking people in a locked building&quot; stuff, which has 
   been done hundreds of times before and much better. While this film 
   has it's fair share of gory effects, including decapitations, 
   flesh-eating, a lower jaw-ripping and slashings, it's a pretty boring 
   and tepid affair. Tom Sizemore, better known recently for his 
   real-life fondness for crystal meth and his ensuing law enforcement 
   and legal problems (not to mention his disastrous appearance on that 
   celebrity rehab TV show), was reportedly a handful on the set of this 
   film, refusing to show up for filming or showing up high as a kite 
   (All of this was documented on the VH1 reality series <B>SHOOTING SIZEMORE</B> 
   [2007]). He still shows a spark here, such as when he's on the phone 
   with Mr. Deaver negotiating a price to save his life (a funny scene), 
   but you can see the ravages of drug use beginning to appear on his 
   face. It's kind of sad to watch such a talented actor self-destruct 
   on screen in such a bad manner, reduced to starring in shoe-scraping 
   crap like this rather than the A-list films of yore. <B>BOTTOM FEEDER</B> 
   is an apt title, but <B>BOTTOM OF THE BARREL</B> is a much better 
   one. Avoid it. Also starring Joe Dinocol, Philip Akin, Tig Fong and

   brings Jim's parents in for a meeting and tells them that if Jim 
   hopes to graduate this year, he will have to be a patient at Dr. 
   Blake's Psychological Research Institute for &quot;behavior 
   modification&quot; (Since when can a high school principal force a

   him an expert? These are just some of the questions you will be 
   asking yourself if you don't turn off your thinking function in your 
   own brain and just go along for the ride.). Jim's parents reluctantly 
   agree (as a going away present, Jim superglue's the principal's ass

   patient. Janet warns him to be careful, because she was a friend of 
   Becky's and knows she was never the same once she became a patient of 
   Dr. Blake. Once at the Institute, an apparently crazy patient tells 
   Jim that Dr. Blake is an alien before brutish orderly Varna (George 
   Buza) takes the patient away. Jim is subjected to some weird video 
   therapy where he has electrodes attached to his head and the giant 
   brain (which also has two eyes and a mouth full of sharp teeth) sends 
   Jim &quot;hypnotic waves&quot;. Jim is able to resist the giant 
   brain's hypnotic waves, but begins to suffer from hallucinations, so 
   Dr, Blake deems Jim unfit for more &quot;treatments&quot;. When it 
   turns out that Dr. Blake has the giant brain broadcasting its 
   hypnotic waves through his TV show in order to reprogram the ways 
   teenagers think (those immune to the brain's waves are the ones 
   causing the murder/suicides, an unfortunate side effect), serious 
   shit begins to happen. Dr. Blake's nurse threatens to spill the beans 
   to the authorities, so the brain swallows her whole (Dr. Blake 
   retorts, &quot;That's food for thought!). The brain (which is getting 
   larger) tries to kill Jim by forcing him to get into a car accident 
   (Jim hallucinates that the steering wheel falls off and is replaced 
   by tentacles). When that doesn't work the brain freaks-out Jim while 
   he is at the diner where Janet and best friend Willie (Brett Pearson) 
   work, scaring the shit out of the employees and customers and Varna 
   shows up with the police, injects him with a tranquilizer and brings 
   him back to the Institute, throwing him into a rubber room. Jim 
   discovers the truth about the brain and, with the help of Janet and 
   Willie, breaks out of the Institute (unfortunately, in the process, 
   Willie is eaten by the brain). Can Jim and Janet keep one-step ahead

   disappears through much of the film). The Brain itself is a supremely 
   goofy creation that somehow gets around by moving it's large brain 
   stem, which Varna calls a &quot;tail&quot;, but is quickly corrected 
   by Dr. Blake (If you look close enough in one scene, you can plainly 
   see that the giant brain is being pushed around on a wheeled 
   platform!). There are plenty of deaths on view, but precious little

   violent criminal Bob Jules (David Crane), just as Bob blows off a 
   deputy's head with a shotgun (another uber-gory effect) and escapes 
   from custody; the lecherous Reverend Farnsworth (Andy Forrest) and

   fishing lodge deep in the woods. As you can probably guess, they all 
   soon come under attack by a couple of alien zombies, who spread their 
   infection not by the normal bite, but by expelling a black slimy 
   liquid out of their mouths and onto the heads of their victims. The 
   dumb-as-a-post and ultra-violent Bob holds everyone hostage, even 
   after witnessing one of the zombies putting his fist through the head 
   of nosy female park ranger Sydney (Tess McVicker), which just adds to 
   the difficulty level of survival for everyone involved. It's not long 
   before our unlucky six fish-out-of-water begin getting gorily killed 
   or infected, beginning with Amy and Bob. It turns out that the 
   big-busted Sherry is not a bimbo at all, but rather a brainiac, as 
   she correctly deduces that the black ooze is an alien organism that 
   attaches itself to the brain, slowly eating it's host's brain until 
   it craves more cerebral tissue. When Clarence and Sherry make an 
   important discovery in the lodge's basement, it becomes apparent that 
   the alien organism is very intelligent. Maybe too intelligent for our 
   meager human brains to understand.&nbsp; Though a little too flippant 
   for it's own good (Dale Gelineau's screenplay offers so many witty 
   remarks from Clarence [he acts like a less-educated Dennis Miller], 
   you'll want to punch him in the face to shut him up), <B><A HREF="brain_dead_2007b.htm">BRAIN
    DEAD</A></B> delivers so much gore and nudity (there's so much full 
   frontal female nudity in the first twenty minutes, you'll think you 
   died and gone to Nudist Heaven!), you'll forgive some of the 
   cringe-worthy dialogue (although I did have a good laugh at Bob's 
   recollection of having a near-death experience on the electric chair 
   and, ever since that day, he can't keep his hair flat!). Director 
   Kevin S. Tenney makes the most out of special makeup effects master 
   Gabe Bartalos' gory makeup effects, never pulling away from the money 
   shots and really delivering the bloody goods, offering decapitations 
   (too many to keep track of) and other head violence, arms hacked or 
   blown off and one zombie being cut in two with a shotgun. The 
   majority of the effects are refreshingly the practical kind, although 
   CGI is employed on a few scenes (including a long shot of the 
   after-effects of Sydney's head-punching). There are a few standout 
   funny sequences, such as Amy being infected by the alien, but since 
   she's such an airhead, the organism bypasses her brain and hides in 
   her uterus instead (!), so when she comes back to the lodge seemingly 
   unharmed, the black ooze shoots out of her vagina and attaches itself 
   to lesbian Claudia's face (a fitting choice). After tossing Claudia 
   face-first into a roaring fireplace, Clarence turns to Sherry and 
   asks, &quot;What kind of amoeba is that?&quot; to which Sherry 
   replies, &quot;A Trojan amoeba? How the Christ do I know?&quot; Tenny 
   also gives the film a funny framing device and offers an 
   unapologetically downbeat, yet sarcastically fitting, finale. You can 
   do a lot worse than this low-budget horror comedy and, God knows, I 
   certainly have. Also starring Locky Lambert, Chad Martin Guerrero,

   Adamson's Independent International Pictures. Lynn (who got Eddie 
   Romero's blessing to make this) stipulated that even though it was 
   going to be filmed in California, there were to be no landmarks and 
   signs to give the viewer any inkling of it not being a

   (1964), which was directed by Gerry de Leon, the same person who 
   co-directed the first two Blood Island films with Eddie Romero 
   (Romero directed the last feature in the trio by himself). This film 
   even uses the entire music soundtrack from <B>MAD DOCTOR</B>, which 
   confused audiences even more. I know that this seems all rather 
   complicated, but Sam Sherman (who is still with us) was a master of 
   promotion and really knew how to draw people into the seats. This 
   film turned out to be one of his most profitable, thanks to a lurid 
   poster with artwork drawn by Gray Morrow and wall-to-wall radio and 
   TV promotion (the trailer is on the DVD, but don't watch it until 
   after you see the film). And like most Independent International 
   films, Sherman gave it many other titles, such as <B><A HREF="brain_1971.htm">THE

   at his villa and have no idea he is dying. Amir asks Mohammed to 
   leave the room so he can talk to Bob and Tracy in private. Amir tells 
   the duo that he wants to live, so he is willing to travel to the 
   United States to have his brain transplanted into another body by 
   disgraced medical professional Dr. Trenton (Kent Taylor; Adamson's <B><A HREF="satans_sadists_1969.htm">SATAN'S
    SADISTS</A></B> - 1969), who had his medical license pulled due to 
   unethical experiments. Bob warns Amir that it is a risky operation 
   and that when he dies, his brain has 15 hours to be transplanted into 
   another body. Within a week after the operation (and some plastic 
   surgery to make him look like his old self), he will be flown back to 
   Kalid, his subjects none the wiser (One week for a brain transplant 
   and plastic surgery? I don't believe first, and only, time 
   screenwriter Joe Van Rodgers [which some people believe is a 
   pseudonym for Kane W. Lynn] did his homework). When Amir asks why the 
   transplant can't be done in Kalid, Tracy says Dr. Trenton is not 
   allowed to leave the United States to practice medicine. Amir accepts 
   and tells Tracy that if the transplant is a success, he wants to make 
   her his wife and Queen, so they can rule the country together. Tracy 
   accepts his proposal, which seems to surprise Bob. The opening 
   credits then roll (with that familiar music) and it looks like the 
   opening of every one of the Blood Island films. We then see Bob, 
   Mohammed and a couple of Kalid lackeys driving in a station wagon in 
   the United States containing Amir's body, which is wrapped in tin 
   foil. They make it to Dr. Trenton's lab, where they carry his body 
   in, while Trenton's diminutive assistant Dorro (Angelo Rossitto; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#LittleCigars1973">LITTLE
    CIGARS</A></B> - 1973), holds the door open for them. It has now 
   been 14&#188; hours since Amir has died (Couldn't they have 
   transported his body over sooner? So many questions. So few answers.) 
   and his replacement body hasn't arrived yet (What?!? As Ralph said on <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE
    SIMPSONS</A></B>: &quot;Unpossible!&quot;). While waiting for the 
   new body to arrive, Dr. Trenton and Bob remove Amir's brain from his 
   body (in bloody close-up footage that goes way past its PG Rating), 
   but Dr. Trenton's hulking, facially deformed assistant Gor (John 
   Bloom; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Incredible2HeadedTr">THE 
   INCREDIBLE 2-HEADED TRANSPLANT</A></B> - 1971) still hasn't found a 
   body suitable for Amir, so he sees a burglar break into an apartment 
   and nearly rape the woman living there and grabs him, but they have a 
   tussle on the fire escape and the burglar falls to his death. When 
   Gor doesn't return in time for the transplant, Dr, Trenton sends 
   Dorro down to the dungeon to get some blood to keep the brain alive. 
   The blood he takes is from young women Dorro has chained to the wall, 
   including newest captive Katherine (Vicki Volante; Adamson's <B><A HREF="#BloodDraculasCastle">BLOOD
    OF DRACULA'S CASTLE</A></B> - 1969), sticking a tube in their arms 
   and letting the blood flow into a mason jar! He also like to smack 
   them around while he laughs like a maniac. Dr. Trenton dismisses Bob, 
   Mohammed and the two lackeys from his house before the transplant can 
   be performed (or a replacement body has arrived), telling them all he 
   needs is Dorro as an assistant because he has taught him the 
   procedure. Mohammed and Bob say they will be back in three days to 
   pick up the new Amir and bring him back to Kalid (Three days? I 
   thought it was a week!). Gor returns with the burglar's body and when 
   Dr. Trenton sees that nearly every bone in the body is broken (Gor is 
   playing with toy cars on the floor), he has no choice but to 
   temporarily put the brain into Gor's body (over Dorro's objections). 
   Dr. Trenton tells Dorro Gor's sad story where, when he was a child 
   (playing with one of those Whammo Air Blasters. Remember them?), 
   Dorro had battery acid poured on his face by two punks when he said 
   something to them after they broke his toy. Trenton tells Dorro that 
   Gor will be better off with the new brain because he will now be 
   intelligent. Dorro buys his line of shit and he assists Dr. Trenton 
   with the brain transplant. Meanwhile, Bob, Mohammed and the two 
   lackeys are run off the road by an assassin (who hired him is still 
   unknown) and only Bob survives, as he jumps out of the car before it 
   rolls down an embankment and bursts into flames. The assassin stop 
   his car to take a look and a hiding Bob gets a good look at his face. 
   Katherine escapes from her shackles and tries to get out of the 
   dungeon, only to find room after room of Dr. Trenton's failures and 
   women that Dorro killed by draining them of all their blood. Bob 
   meets Tracy at the airport (Adamson making sure not to show any signs 
   to indicate that it is LAX) and tells her what is going on, so they 
   head back to Dr. Trenton's lab while Katherine keeps running into Dr. 
   Trenton's medical failures (some still alive).&nbsp; When Bob and 
   Tracy are driving back to the lab, Bob sees the assassin on the 
   sidewalk and a footchase over rooftops proceeds which then turns into 
   a fistfight, where the assassin breaks loose and runs to his car, but 
   when he turns the key, the car explodes, thanks to a bomb planted 
   there by Dorro (Dorro watches in the bushes laughing. Yes, Dorro is a 
   miniature sadist.) I guess we know who hired the assassin: Dr. 
   Trenton. Once Bob and Tracy reach the lab (Dorro is now there dressed 
   in scrubs. How did he get there before Bob and Tracy?), Dr. Trenton 
   (who is surprised to see Bob alive) tells the duo that he and Dorro 
   plan on taking the new Amir to a country where Dr. Trenton will be 
   &quot;appreciated&quot; (Dr. Trenton plans to live in a coountry 
   where he can implant the brains of rich people into young bodies so 
   they can live forever. Wait just a minute. Doesn't the brain grow old 
   like the rest of the body? How is putting an old brain in a young 
   body going to change that? Yes, I know, I think too much.). Poor 
   Katherine is still in a pickle, as a (fake) spider is on her arm and 
   she keeps running into Trenton and Dorro's victims until she passes 
   out. While Dorro is disabling Bob and Tracy's car, Amir has seen what 
   a monster he has become and nearly strangles Dr. Trenton to death, 
   but Tracy talks him out of it. Suddenly, Tracy accuses Bob of being 
   in on it and the monstrous Amir knocks Bob out (I knew not to trust 
   that bitch!). Dorro drags Bob to the dungeon, but Katherine kills 
   Dorro by stabbing him in the stomach with a huge hypodermic needle 
   (Adamson doesn't even hide the fact that the hypodermic doesn't have 
   a needle on it and just has Rossitto grab his stomach and fall 
   down!), Tracy and Amir flee the lab, but since the car is disabled,<A HREF="brain_of_blood_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/brain of blood vhs front9 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   they try to hitch a ride. Dr. Trenton has installed a secret 
   electrode in Amir's brain and with an instrument he carries, he can 
   cause Amir great pain if he is close enough. Tracy uses her good 
   looks to flag down a car, but when the passenger gets out, Dr. 
   Trenton uses his instrument and Amir/Gor kills the passenger, the 
   driver taking off in fear. It soon becomes a three-way chase when Bob 
   and Katherine go looking for Amir, but for different reasons than Dr. 
   Trenton. Amir begins to have some of Gor's memories (it seems the 
   human soul is not located in the brain), but it soon becomes obvious 
   that Tracy and Dr. Trenton are working together (So why did she run 
   away with Amir? I know, I'm over-thinking again), so Amir runs away. 
   The monstrous Amir meets Katherine and young boy Jimmy (<A HREF="gary graver.htm">Gary
    Graver</A>'s son Sean) and convinces them that he means no harm, but 
   he can't be near them because the electrode in his brain makes him do 
   things beyond his control. Bob shoots Amir in the leg (it really 
   doesn't do much harm), while Tracy runs away and falls off a cliff, 
   killing herself (Stupid bitch.). Amir follows Dr. Trenton's orders to 
   bring Bob back to the lab, where Dr. Trenton transplants Amir's brain 
   into Bob's body. The film ends in Kalid, where Amir gives a televised 
   speech announcing that Dr. Trenton will be the country's new Minister 
   of Science. Evil wins once again, leaving a wake of dead bodies 
   behind.&nbsp; This is one of Adamson's worst films, not only because 
   it was shot is eight days, but because there are just too many plot 
   holes in the script. I have seen all of Adamson's films, so I guess 
   I'm a masochist, but I also have watched every Andy Milligan film, 
   too. I like bad films as long as they offer some twisted 
   entertainment to the viewer (the closest this film comes is the brain 
   transplantation, where we see scalpels cut flesh and hemostats pull 
   back the skin), but most of Adamson's films are just point and shoot, 
   where Milligan always had his camera moving. This film has a lot of 
   Adamson's stock players, but this is the only film that Grant 
   Williams (<B><A HREF="incredible_shrinking_man_1957.htm">THE 
   INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN</A></B> - 1957) did for him. At least 
   Williams had the sense of not appearing in any more of Adamson's 
   abominations. This film was first released on <A HREF="brain_1971.htm">VHS</A>

    This film must have come as a shock to most renters because they had 
   no idea what they were in for: A female-nudity filled, 
   bladder-busting old-school makeup effects (supplied by effects master 
   Ed French, who also has a major acting role in this film) and alien 
   goop-filled sexploitation horror film that nearly defies description. 
   I said nearly, because the plot <A HREF="breeders_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/breeders 1986 vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>is
    so outlandish. The film starts with a hooker running down a dark 
   alley when she runs into a seemingly harmless old man who is walking 
   his dog. They strike up a polite conversation and then the old man 
   keels over in pain, as his flesh rips away from his hands, exposing 
   some type of alien being, who carries away the girl and rapes her 
   (offscreen). She is rushed to Manhattan General Hospital, where head 
   Dr. Gamble Pace (Theresa Farley) informs Detective Dale Andriotti 
   (Lance Lewman) that this is one of several women who have been raped 
   in the past couple of days and they all had one thing in common: they 
   were all virgins (try not to think about the hooker in the opening 
   scene being a virgin because it will just drive you insane). As the 
   film progresses, we get to see many women topless (thankfully all 
   natural and not silicone-enhanced) as their male friends begin to 
   change and burst out of their skin, they are actually an alien being 
   who can possess any body it wants. It ends up raping the girls and 
   putting them in Dr. Pace's hospital (One girl has nipples so big for 
   an A-Cup, they cover her entire breasts!). Gamble and Dale work 
   together to try and find out who or what is responsible for these 
   vicious attacks (some girls are so scarred, they will never heal 
   properly). They find all the girls have another thing in common 
   (besides being virgins): They all had traces of red brick dust on 
   their bodies and it could have only come from certain places 
   underground from New York City's past. They do a radius search and 
   discover that the nearest place to use red bricks was the basement of 
   the Empire State Building and (surprise!) the hospital has a tunnel 
   that leads right to it. Suddenly, all the raped girls get out of 
   their beds and head to the basement of the Empire State building, 
   where they all bathe naked and writhing in a goop-filled pool-like 
   structure, while the evil Dr. Ira Markum (Ed French) informs our 
   intrepid pair (who were following the evidence) that once the women 
   deliver the alien babies, the people of Earth stand no chance of 
   surviving.&nbsp; Dr. Markum begins to change into an alien being 
   (some really disgusting bladder effects), while Dale tries to pump a 
   few bullets into it with no effect. Dale and the alien get into a 
   fight and just when things look grim for Dale, Gamble comes to the 
   rescue and impales the alien on a sharpened piece of wood, destroying 
   it (seems there was only one!) and destroying the chance of the women 
   having their alien babies (try not to think too hard, just go with 
   it). The film ends with Gamble in bed with Dale and he turns into an 
   alien, but it all turns out to be a nightmare. The camera pans back 
   on a frightened Gamble lying in her bed, worried that the whole thing 
   will happen again (Or is she pregnant? It was discovered that while 
   she was under the Empire State Building that she was a virgin!). This 
   short, 77-minute exercise in female nudity (some full frontal and 
   some ass shots, too) and disgusting practical special effects 
   (Kincaid's ex-wife Cynthia De Paula was Producer on all these films, 
   but not his gay porn films) makes absolutely no sense (I mean, 
   really, there were that many virgins in NYC in 1986?) and the acting 
   is way below par, but it does have that certain something that makes 
   you want to watch it over and over (I, myself, have seen it well over 
   20 times). It's just so weird and out-there that it belongs in a 
   universe of its own and the effects, though obviously done on an 
   extremely low budget, are very good, especially Ed French's 
   transformation in the final minutes. Most of these films never 
   received a theatrical release (although <B>BAD GIRLS DORMITORY</B> 
   and <B>ENE</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">M</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>Y

   all these film may be sub-par, but there is enough blood and gore to 
   make even the most ardent horror and action film fanatic happy. 
   Kincaid went back to working on gay porn films immediately after he 
   was done with these films, something he is still doing up till this 
   day (and winning awards from the gay community). Arthur D. Marks was 
   Director of Cinematography on all these films. Also known as <B><A HREF="killer_alien_1986.htm">KILLER-ALIEN</A></B>.
    This film is worth your time because it is relatively short, 
   contains many shots of unaltered naked female flesh (most of the 
   girls' breasts are very small) and contains effects that bring back 
   memories of the good old days, when CGI was not even a thought. It's 
   no classic, but I'll be damned if I don't love it to death. Also

   actually a local plantation owner (Mario Montenegro) who transforms 
   into the creature thanks to the radiation. He's not the only thing 
   that's affected. There's killer trees and plant life that tear people 
   apart with their very flexible branches and limbs. The most hilarious 
   scene is where Kent Taylor is attacked by a killer butterfly! This 
   film does deliver in the blood and nudity department. Bloody body

   (veteran actor L.Q. Jones) of the next town called Hillsboro. They 
   are attacked by the entire town and escape, only to be run off the 
   road by a small girl blocking their way. They have to make their way 
   back to the town. We slowly learn that the town's residents are being 
   killed off (27 adults killed in 72 hours) and their children 
   abducted, who are later to be used to transfer the souls of the old 
   coven of Devil worshippers into the body of the children in order to 
   keep alive for eternity. The town doctor (the always fabulous 
   Strother Martin in a rare starring role) is the leader of the coven, 
   not above killing one of his coven for having her granddaughter

   Tobey (Alvy Moore) thinks it's all the fault of UFOs (he's not the 
   smartest fish in the tank). Ben and the Sheriff investigate (there's 
   a surreal scene where they survey all the dead adult bodies stored in 
   the local meat locker), while Nicky has a dream that all the bodies 
   in the meat locker are actually the children instead of the adults

    ALIVE</A><A NAME="BuriedAlive2006"></A> (2006) -</B> Tired 
   &quot;teens in peril&quot; slasher film with a couple of strong 
   bursts of graphic gore. Zane (Terence Jay, who also composed the 
   music score) takes a bunch of college kids, including cousin Rene 
   (Leah Rachel); her boyfriend Danny (Steve Sandvoss); nerdy geek Phil 
   (Germaine De Leon); and sorority pledges Laura (Erin Michelle Lokitz; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Graveyard2006">THE
    GRAVEYARD</A></B> - 2006) and Julie (Lindsey Scott) to a house in an 
   old New Mexico ghost town in the middle of the desert. The house 
   belonged to Zane's grandfather, who, years ago, was the only survivor 
   of a massacre in the house. Legend says that there's a fortune in 
   gold hidden in the house and after being warned by creepy caretaker 
   Lester (Tobin Bell; the <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW</A></B> 
   franchise) not to spend the night in the house, Zane and the 
   stereotypical stupid teens ignore his warnings and enter the house. 
   It's clear from the beginning that cousins Zane and Rene are 
   harboring romantic feelings <A HREF="buried_alive_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/buried alive 2006 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>for
    each other (but they keep it secret from the others), but both of 
   them are also prone to disturbing visions (Rene dreams that Zane 
   drowns her in a bathtub and Zane keeps seeing a creepy old hag which 
   no one else sees), which are all clues of things to come. Zane 
   believes the missing gold is located somewhere in the house's 
   cavernous sub-basement, but immediately notices that someone (it's 
   Lester) has been recently digging down there (We see Lester find a 
   huge gold nugget earlier in the film). The killings finally begin 
   when Phil goes outside to get better wi-fi reception for his laptop 
   and is cut in two down (vertically down the middle) by someone 
   swinging an axe. Laura is nearly the next one to be killed by the 
   axe-wielding specter (who rises out of a blood-filled bathtub), but a 
   circular tattoo on her back stops the specter from killing her. Some 
   old photos found in the house reveal that Rene bears a striking 
   resemblance to Zane's great-grandfather's second wife and the 
   necklace Rene wears is actually a totem (It's the same design as 
   Laura's tattoo) and it looks like the specter is the vengeful spirit 
   of great-granddad's first wife, a Native American Indian who was 
   buried alive so great-grandpappy could marry his second wife. She 
   wants to kill the last of great-grandfather's bloodline, which 
   happens to be Zane and Rene, and she'll kill anyone who gets in her 
   way. The specter works her way through the rest of the cast (only 
   Laura survives, thanks to her body art), giving Zane and Rene a 
   fitting demise in the finale. What about the missing gold? Well, I'm 
   afraid that's left for another film.&nbsp; Although director Robert 
   Kurtzman (<B><A HREF="demolitionist_1995.htm">THE DEMOLITIONIST</A></B>

    RAGE</A></B> - 2007) tosses in plenty of exploitable elements, 
   including lots of female nudity and gore (also supplied by Kurtzman, 
   who got his start in the business as one of the three founding 
   members of the KNB Effects Group), it's the lack of any sympathetic 
   characters that sinks this film from the start. Not only is the near-incestuous
    relationship between Zane and Rene creepy (I realize it's not 
   against the law, but, really, do we need to think about flipper kids 
   in their future?), but it takes nearly 72 minutes (excluding Phil's 
   killing) for the blood and gore to finally reach the screen. Until 
   then, it's nothing but talk, talk, talk, followed by brief bits of 
   nudity and a couple of false scares, some more talking, brief nudity, 
   false scares and repeat until the blood finally kicks in. Rene comes 
   across as a real nasty cunt, who gets so jealous when Zane and Julia 
   have sex, she hazes both pledges just for the sheer joy of it, which 
   results in Julie's death. Besides a couple of creative and gory 
   deaths (Danny getting his face cut off with an axe; Phil's death), <B><A HREF="buried_alive_2006b.htm">BURIED
    ALIVE</A></B> is nothing but a generic slasher flick that offers 
   very little to the genre. It seems screenwriter Art Monterastelli 
   forgot to put the &quot;slash&quot; into slasher, as the on-screen 
   body count is anemic (Four, but we only see two of them on-screen and 
   Zane and Rene are buried alive). It's hard to believe a special 
   effects master like Kurtzman could turn out a boring piece of tripe 
   like this. He should know better. A Dimension Extreme Films DVD

   the Salem witch trials in 1692, spoiled brat Ann Putnam (Susan Swift) 
   falsely accuses the wife and young daughter of William Goode (David

   corrupt witchfinder Reverend Parris (John Peters), results in 
   William's wife being hanged and daughter Dorcas (Jennine Babo) about

   history of the Salem witch trials. On their way the the Salem 
   Witchcraft Museum, Loreen feels a strange sensation when the bus she

   street and her dog starts chasing the bus, running alongside Loreen's

   within spying distance of Loreen, even though local cop Captain 
   Billingham (Albert Salmi) is called in to investigate Loreen's attack

   on and when they visit the Salem cemetery, Loreen's teacher is killed 
   when she saves Loreen from a falling tree branch. After her teacher's 
   death, Loreen begins to talk in an early American dialect and her 
   worried mother, Karen (Trisha Sterling), calls on famous psychologist 
   Dr. Grossinger (Guy Stockwell) to look at her but, at first, he has 
   no idea what is going on. When William breaks into Loreen's bedroom 
   and confronts her, Karen shoots him (nothing happens; the bullets 
   just pass through his body) and Captain Billingham captures him and 
   puts William in the local jail, where he tells his story to an 
   understanding TV reporter (Frank Dolan). We then begin to realize 
   that William was sent to the present day to get Loreen, who is now 
   possessed by the spirit of Ann Putnam, to confess to her lies about 
   her accusations against Dorcas. If she does, William's daughter will 
   be saved from being burned at the stake back in 1692. When the 
   reporter is killed (by the horribly burned visage of Reverend Parrish 
   and the possessed Loreen) for getting too close to the truth, good 
   witch Merlina helps William, Kathy and Loreen achieve karmic

   the better 80's slasher films, thanks to the natural acting of the 
   young cast (including a pre-bald Jason Alexander, a very young Fisher 
   Stevens and a very early role for Holly Hunter), an eerie electronic 
   score by Rick Wakeman and the bloody effects of Tom Savini, many of

   is available uncut for the first time in a pristine widescreen print. 
   The plot of this film is your standard slasher story, but the acting 
   and practically everything else in front and behind the screen is 
   first rate. A bunch of camp kids play a practical joke on the 
   caretaker, Cropsy, that gets out of hand, resulting in him being 
   horribly burned over his entire body. Five years pass and he is 
   discharged from the hospital because there is nothing left they can 
   do for him (none of his skin grafts were successful). The first thing 
   he does is visit a prostitute. When she is repulsed by the sight of 
   his face (we won't see it until the finale), Cropsy savagely stabs 
   her with scissors (the first of the restored footage) and pushes her 
   through a window. He then goes back to his old stomping ground, Camp 
   Stonewater, and begins to stalk <A HREF="burning_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/burning vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="190" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>and
    kill the kids and camp counselors with a pair of garden shears. One 
   of the kids, the timid Alfred (Brian Backer), who is afraid of the 
   water, is the first to spot Cropsy, but can't get anyone to believe 
   him. During a weekend canoe trip down river, Cropsy begins his 
   killing spree, picking off the kids and counselors one-by-one.&nbsp; 
   He also sets loose the canoes, forcing the kids to build a raft and 
   use it to paddle up river, leading to the film's most talked-about 
   scene: The slaughter of half the cast by Cropsy in the middle of the 
   river (made more memorable by the reinsertion of the cut gore, 
   including finger-lopping, throat stabbing and a nasty forehead 
   slashing). Alfred and the remaining campers are left to fend for 
   themselves as Cropsy targets them next. When the raft drifts back to 
   them with the mutilated bodies of their friends still on it, they 
   finally believe Alfred, who is now being chased through the woods by 
   Cropsy. A final fight between Cropsy and one of the counselors 
   reveals that the counselor was one of the kids responsible for 
   burning Cropsy five years earlier. Alfred saves the day, but not 
   before one final surprise. This early Miramax film (first distributed 
   by Orion and then by MGM), co-written by Bob Weinstein and produced 
   by brother Harvey Weinstein, has a lot to recommend. The banter and 
   foreplay between the cast is honest and rings true, which makes their 
   deaths all the more horrible. The deaths are downright gory. While 
   the raft sequence may get the most press, I found the death of Glazer 
   (Larry Joshua) to be much more gutteral. His stabbing in the upper 
   chest by the garden shears, with the camera tracking him eventually 
   being impaled to a tree is a highlight. When Cropsy pulls the shears 
   out of him in one quick, bloody jerk, your anus will pucker. The 
   print shown on MostersHD is a revelation. It's crisp, colorful (the 
   blood really pops) and, for the first time, you can see it in all 
   it's uncut glory. Nudity was also trimmed for it's R release, so now 
   you are able to see some full frontal female nudity (and Larry 
   Joshua's ass) that you missed in the edited version. Director Tony

   &quot;Julia's Love&quot; is a pretty standard slasher tale dealing 
   with an asylum escapee (Bernd Muggenthaler) who gets jilted by Julia 
   (Beate Neumeyer), when she finds out he's an asylum escapee, and his 
   subsequent stalking of her and the murdering of her family. &quot;The 
   Purity&quot; is not as standard in that it deals with a demented 
   priest (Rudolf Hos) who, in 1957, rapes and murders young women while 
   proclaiming that he is purifying their souls. The bulk of the tale 
   deals with the townfolk's persecution of Justuz (Andre Stryi) under 
   the belief that it is he that is doing the killings. What happens to 
   the man who kills him is really sick and twisted. The main claim to 
   fame of this film is that it is a shot-on-video gore extravaganza. 
   There is a lot of gore in this movie. Stabbings, impalements, 
   beheadings, bullet hits and many other fun moments can be had here. 
   In the final minutes there is one of the most grotesque journeys 
   through Hell I have ever seen. Most of the gore is very convincing.

   unwatchable. Unlike <B>NE</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">K</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>ROMANTIK</B>

   unusual horror western, something is stalking the families living in 
   the Dakota Territories in the late summer of 1879. As more families 
   end up missing or strangely murdered, local lawman John Clay (Clancy 
   Brown: <B><A HREF="carvivale_tv_series_2003-2005.htm">CARNIVALE</A></B> [2003-2005])
    believes it is the Indians that are responsible (There is no love 
   lost between Indians and the white man in this film, which adds to 
   it's believability). When local girl Maryann Stewart (Jocelin 
   Donahue; <B><A HREF="house_of_the_devil_2009.htm">HOUSE OF THE DEVIL</A></B>

   Williams family is savagely slaughtered (their bodies all bear 
   strange slash marks on their necks that, for some reason, didn't 
   bleed), Clay forms a posse, which includes Maryann's intended suitor 
   Fergus Coffy (Karl Geary), William Parcher (an excellent William 
   Mapother; <B><A HREF="grudge_2004.htm">THE GRUDGE</A></B> - 2004) and 
   young Dobie (Galen Hutchinson), the son of William's fianc&eacute;e, 
   Gertrude Spacks (Laura Leighton). After burying the Williams family 
   and Fergus noticing some strange holes burrowed in the surrounding 
   property, John and his posse join up with an Army regimen headed by 
   Henry Victor (Doug Hutchinson; <B><A HREF="green_mile_1999.htm">THE 
   GREEN MILE</A></B> - 1999), his cook Walnut Callaghan (Sean Patrick 
   Thomas; <B><A HREF="dracula_2000_1999.htm">DRACULA 2000</A></B> - 
   1999) and various Indian guides, with hopes of rescuing Maryann and 
   killing some Indians, but they will soon discover that the Indians 
   are the least of their problems. The sadistic Henry Victor makes it 
   clear to everyone that he is in charge and to prove it, he spots a 
   lone Indian on the plains, shoots his horse and has his Indian guide 
   Ten Bear (Anthony Parker) torture the poor young buck just for the 
   shit and giggles (Henry hates Indians so much, he carries a tobacco 
   pouch made from a dead Indian's scrotum!). Most everyone else in the 
   posse don't care much for Henry's methods (When Walnut takes pity on 
   the tortured Indian and gives him some food, Henry screams out, 
   &quot;Who fed my Indian!&quot; and nearly kills Fergus when he takes 
   the heat), but they have to put up with his cruelty since he wears 
   the stripes and threatens to hang anyone who disobeys him (his 
   handlebar moustache only amps-up his evil quotient). That night, 
   while everyone is asleep except for a couple of Army guards, 
   something from underground grabs four Army soldiers and Henry, of 
   course, blames the Indians. The captive young buck mentions &quot;The 
   Burrowers&quot;, a tribe of underground dwellers that have begun 
   eating Indians since their main source of protein, the buffalo, have 
   been hunted to near extinction by the white man (He also says of the 
   Burrowers, &quot;I'm glad they like white men, too!&quot;). Since 
   Henry thinks this is nothing but a bunch of bullcrap and is more 
   interested in killing Indians than chasing monsters, John, William, 
   Fergus and Dobie break from the Army regimen and go on a monster 
   hunt, following a trail of holes in the ground (Walnut shows up a 
   short time later to help them). They find the body of a young white 
   woman who seems to be dead, but her eyes are open and her body is 
   twitching weirdly, so they send Dobie back to town with the body. 
   Dobie never makes it, as when he beds down on the plains at night, he 
   is dragged away by a Burrower after being slashed on the neck and 
   infected. John is shot in the neck (and then has his face graphically 
   caved-in with a rifle butt) by some renegade Sioux Indians, leaving 
   William, Fergus and Walnut to fend for themselves. William is 
   infected in his neck by a Burrower, but Fergus and Walnut save him 
   and run into a squaw named Faith (Alexandra Edmo), who explains to 
   them just who the Burrowers are and their method of killing (Their 
   infection causes a waking death and they wait for the bodies to start 
   decomposing and eat the &quot;soft parts&quot;). Only the Ute Tribe 
   knows how to kill the Burrowers (you have to poison them at night so 
   they can't burrow underground and the morning sunlight will kill 
   them), so the Utes steal William, poison his body and wait for the 
   Burrowers to feast on him. Fergus and Walnut try to save their 
   friend, but Walnut gets shot in the leg and Fergus gets one of his 
   legs caught in a bear trap, which leads to the Burrowers chowing-down 
   on William's still-alive body and Fergus trying to free himself 
   before he is next on the menu.&nbsp; Helped tremendously by a cast of

   (Fergus and the gang having a contest to see who can hit a tree with 
   a rock [the Old West version of playing a video game!]; how hard it 
   is to take a piss in cowboy pants without peeing on yourself), but it 
   is this minutiae and lack of anachronisms found in most modern horror 
   westerns that makes this film so effective. You begin to care about 
   these people, faults and all (especially everyone's pure hatred for 
   Indians), so when they start dying, be it by Indian (many who are 
   just as cruel as Henry), white man or Burrowers' hands (In the 
   Burrowers' case, it would be claws), it's effective and tugs at your 
   emotions. Petty purposely keeps the Burrowers off-screen for most of 
   the film's running time (which is bound to piss off some horror 
   fans), rather offering us quick glimpses of their faces and claws 
   (and their method of infecting humans), so when he finally does show 
   them in all their glory (and thankfully, they are performed by humans 
   and puppeteers rather than CGI), it's quite shocking. I also like how 
   Petty uses the loss of buffalo as a food source to justify the 
   Burrowers eating humans. Again, it's the white man's fault these 
   monsters are murdering people, since they hunted the buffalo into 
   near extinction for their skins. Just another reason for the Indians 
   to hate us. I was a little disappointed when Doug Hutchinson's Henry 
   disappeared at the film's midway point (although he makes a quick 
   appearance at the film's end and sets the film up for an eventual 
   sequel), because he's deliciously evil, but there's more than enough 
   going on in this film to keep audiences entertained throughout. It's 
   always nice to see William Mapother (Tom Cruise's cousin) in such a 
   prominent role. Talent runs in that family. Besides some too-dark 
   nighttime photography and some noticeable CGI (gunshots to horses are 
   the most obvious), this film is a great addition to the burgeoning 
   horror western genre (see my review of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#UndeadOrAlive2007">UNDEAD
    OR ALIVE</A></B> [2007] for more titles). Hell, I'll even go as far 
   as to say it's one of the best horror films released in 2009. A 
   eighteen minute prequel, called <B>BLOOD RED EARTH</B> (told entirely 
   from the Indians' POV), was shown on internet site <A HREF="http://www.fearnet.com">FearNet</A> 
   in 2009. You don't have to view it to appreciate the movie (As a

   into an Indian (Jim Elk) who tells them to leave this area 
   immediately and then encounter a 7-foot tall Druid demon (played by 
   hulking former basketball player &quot;Tiny&quot; Ron Taylor) who is 
   looking to perform four ritual sacrifices in order the save the next 
   millennium (don't try to make sense of this because you'll just end 
   up pulling your hair out). He kidnaps and chains all four girls in a 
   cave and prepares them for sacrifice by drugging them. The motorcycle 
   gang (who kidnap the wino), initially invade the camp to rape the 
   women, but end up helping Vince save three of the girls, the fourth 
   having her throat cut by the Druid. Frog saves the day when his knife 
   reflects the Druid's laser beam (don't ask) and engulfs the giant in 
   flames. There's also a huge sea monster in the lake that takes out 
   two of the motorcycle gang and the wino. The four sacrifices save the 
   next millennium. While short on logic, there plenty of eye candy to 
   keep you occupied and some priceless dialogue to keep you amused. The 
   late Buck Flower has a larger than usual role here as the wino who 
   wears a pair of sunglasses missing a lens and offers anyone 
   information for a beer or a bottle of wine. There's also a very brief 
   view of the sea monster, a fire gag and very little blood except for 
   the throat-slitting ritual at the end. The Lambada dance leads me to 
   believe that this film was made a few years before it's 1994 
   copyright as that craze died down quicker than you could say 
   &quot;mood ring&quot; or &quot;pet rock&quot; in 70s &amp; 80s (My 
   guess is that the film was actually made in 1990). Tiny Ron is a

    I have come to the conclusion (or is that concussion?) that 
   Margheriti is a minor genius. Sure, this film contains ample amounts 
   of graphic gore and flesh-munching fans of this genre demand, but 
   it&#146;s the subtleties of the performances and script (co-written 
   by Margheriti and Dardano Sacchetti) that make it stand out from the 
   pack. John Saxon gives a quiet, understated performance as Norman

   feels after cheating on his wife Jane (Elizabeth Turner) with teenage 
   neighbor Mary (Cinzia De Carolis, as &quot;Cindy Hamilton&quot;) and 
   the guilt he hides inside concerning himself, Charlie (John Morghen) 
   and Tom (Tony King), two men he saved from a Vietnamese P.O.W. camp: 
   They are infected with a virus which causes them to crave human 
   flesh. Norman is able to control his craving until he has to save 
   Charlie, who has just chewed a girl in a movie theater and is now 
   holed-up in a department store, keeping the police at bay with a 
   shotgun. Norman convinces Charlie to give himself up and he is 
   immediately shipped off to a loony asylum where Tom is a resident. 
   Norman helps them escape, along with a recently infected nurse (the 
   virus is spread with a bite). With the cops hot on their trail, the 
   quartet hide in the sewers beneath the city, only to get picked-off 
   one-by-one until only Norman is left. Badly wounded, Norman manages 
   to make it home, where he sees his wife get bitten by an infected 
   cop. Norman shoots the cop and Jane embraces him, pointing the gun he 
   is holding at her head. With a loving look from his wife, he knows 
   what he must do. As the police pull up to the house, two gunshots are 
   heard. The police are glad it is over, as we view an infected Mary 
   (who Norman bit during their lovemaking session) watching the 
   proceedings from her window, smiling. This film works on many levels. 
   It has many gross moments (that you will not see in the cut version), 
   including a graphic eye gouging, a tongue being bitten off, impromptu 
   leg surgery involving a mechanic's electric saw and John 
   Morghen&#146;s (real name: Giovanni Lombardo Radice) death by 
   shotgun. He has a hole blown into him big enough to pass a subway car 
   through, as the cameraman obligingly shows us. In my younger years, 
   this would have been all I&#146;ve needed to enjoy a film of this 
   type, but as I get older I need more. A good story would be nice. 
   Thankfully, this film delivers that need. While this film does not

    for Norman, even when he cheats on his wife with his overeager 
   teenybopper neighbor. Norman&#146;s actions in this film are 
   justified, because when you save someone from a life or death 
   situation (as he does when he saves Charlie and Tom during the war), 
   a sense of obligation to those people remains with you till the day 
   you die. John Saxon relays those feelings perfectly in this film. 
   When he is seduced by the underaged Cindy, we can see just by the 
   look on his face that he does not want to go through with it, but 
   when she bares her flesh, it is just too much for him (mainly due to 
   the cannibalistic urges that surge throughout his body). This is not 
   a sexual tryst but a loss of his human morality. The finale brings 
   his human side back, where the right decision has to be made. It is 
   very touching without being overly-sentimental. My first article on <A HREF="antonio_margheriti_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Antonio
    Margheriti</A> was in issue #1 of Critical Condition. In that 
   article, I basically called him a hack who lost all sense of 
   originality when he started making rip-off films for a living. I am 
   here now to say that I was wrong. I have learned to look more deeply 
   into the films I am viewing (without being overly-analytical like 
   some reviewers, so analytical that you would have to be a 
   psychiatrist to understand the reviews). Sure, </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="cannibal_apocalypse_1980c.htm">CANNIBAL

   is a quickie film whose foremost reason for being is to gross-out the 
   audience, but Margheriti does imbue this film with a sense of right 
   and wrong that you don&#146;t find in most films of this type. Since 
   issue #1, I have read many interviews with actors and others who have 
   worked with Margheriti. None of them (including John Morghen, Fred 
   Williamson, John Saxon, etc.) have even the tiniest bad thing to say 
   about him. They have all said that it was a pleasure to work with him 
   and that they would work with him again in a heartbeat. He is a 
   funny, knowledgeable person who is not the least bit egotistical.

   couple Cliff and Gloria (Second City vets Eugene Levy and Andrea 
   Martin) are on their way to Farnhamville (&quot;The Friendly 
   City&quot;) when their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. They 
   eventually get it started, but not before we spot someone spying on 
   them through the trees in the snowy forest. Once they get to town, 
   Cliff meets another out-of-town man who is looking for his missing 
   sister (He's eventually murdered by two local garage mechanics). 
   Cliff and Gloria get a motel room and the motel owner tells them the 
   &quot;legend&quot; of the three sisters who lived in the area. They 
   lured men to their house with the promise of sex, fatten them up with 
   home-cooked meals and then kill them while in the sack. Their 
   hunchback servant, Bunker, then chops up the bodies into manageable 
   pieces and puts the dismembered parts in a freezer in the basement to 
   be eaten later. Yes, the three girls were (are) cannibals and the 
   motel owner tells Cliff and Gloria that the sisters' house is now a 
   restaurant and they should have dinner there tonight. At the 
   restaurant <A HREF="cannibal_girls_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cannibal girls ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>(which
    has only one dish on the menu), they are greeted and entertained by 
   the Reverend (Ronald Ulrich), the tux and top hat-wearing owner who, 
   with the three sisters, serves Cliff and Gloria a meal they will 
   never forget. It becomes apparent that the Reverend is the leader of 
   the town and all the citizens are cannibals. Cliff and Gloria spend 
   the night at the Reverend's house (he scares them into staying by 
   telling them that there's a maniac on the loose) and Cliff is 
   hypnotized by the Reverend, but Gloria gets away. The next morning, 
   Gloria tries to convince Cliff to leave, but he refuses to believe 
   her story (he's still under the Reverend's power). With their car 
   being repaired and all the outside phone lines down, Gloria must get 
   Cliff to snap out of it before they both become a menu item in the 
   Reverend's restaurant. It all ends back at the Reverend's house, 
   where a shocking act of betrayal seals Cliff and Gloria's fate. Bon 
   Appetite!&nbsp; This bloody Canadian horror/comedy is an early 
   directorial credit for Ivan Reitman, who would later produce David 
   Cronenberg's <B><A HREF="they_came_from_within_1975.htm">SHIVERS</A></B>

   few scenes, some of the acting is amateurish and parts of the film 
   drag), <B><A HREF="cannibal_girls_1972.htm">CANNIBAL GIRLS</A></B> is 
   still an enjoyable low-budget gore romp that doesn't have as much 
   comedy as you would expect, especially from the two main stars. 
   Eugene Levy (nearly unrecognizable, he looks like Gene Shalit here) 
   and Andrea Martin are rather subdued (a lot of the dialogue between 
   Levy and Martin was improvised) and are nothing like the characters 
   they played on SCTV. The comedy comes mostly from the absurdities of 
   the situations and some of the townspeople's character traits. 
   There's also funny little bits going on in the background of some 
   scenes, such as when Cliff and Gloria are walking through town and we 
   see the local barber cut off a patron's ear while giving him a shave. 
   The film is full of nudity (none by Levy or Martin) and gore, 
   including axe murders, stabbings, dismemberments, flesh eating and a 
   nasty mace killing. This little-seen gem was originally shown in 
   theaters (distributed by American International Pictures) with the 
   gimmick of a &quot;Warning Bell&quot; that would ring every time a 
   violent scene was about to happen. The print I viewed (supplied by a 
   Canadian friend) was, thankfully, free of this annoyance. This film 
   never got a home video release in the U.S. (it was distributed in 
   Canada on VHS from the CIC label), on VHS or on DVD. Ivan Reitman 
   (who owns the U.S. rights) is holding up the release and is known not 
   to speak fondly of it. He really has nothing to be ashamed of. It's 
   highly watchable and kind of twisted. Also starring Alan Gordon, 
   Allan Price, Bob McHeady, May Jarvis and Randall Carpenter, Bonnie 
   Nielson and Mira Pawluk as the Cannibal Girls. A CIC Video Release.

   it's real-life animal violence). Two has-been TV newscasters, Grace 
   Forsythe (Helena Wagner) and Bob Manson (Claudio Morales), join 
   forces and film a &quot;documentary&quot; on cannibalism along the 
   Amazon River. With a promised paycheck of one million dollars each 
   from Grace's TV station (as long as they transmit gory, 
   sensationalistic footage), they set out down river with their crew: 
   Cindy Blair (Cindy Matic), Bob's assistant; Rick Norton (Kevin 
   Maxwell), the cameraman; and Ted Brandon (Antoine Reboul), the sound 
   recordist. They hire a native guide named Garcia (he wears torn blue 
   jeans!) and, within a day, they are filming a tribe eating what seems 
   to be human flesh. They also film a squad of gun-toting Forest 
   Rangers gunning-down the tribe. Grace, Bob and the crew head deeper 
   into the jungle looking for the &quot;Invisible People&quot;, a 
   much-talked about, but never seen (until now) tribe of cannibals. The 
   footage that Grace sends back (by satellite transmission) is a big 
   hit with the viewing <A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_the_beginning_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cannibal holocaust the beginning dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>audience,
    but her bosses demand more bloody, graphic footage to increase 
   ratings, which worries Bob, who is a conservationist at heart. The 
   callous Grace gets too involved in her work when, after watching the 
   cannibal tribe gut and eat a conscious topless native woman, she 
   orders the crew to set fire to the village and film the cannibals 
   being burned alive. Even Bob eventually gets caught-up in the moment 
   and starts randomly killing cannibals. Of course, this all bites them 
   in the ass, especially when Ted and Bob rape a young cannibal girl (<B><I>Ted:</I></B> 
   &quot;She's a virgin!&quot; <B><I>Bob:</I></B> &quot;She was, you 
   mean!&quot;), slaughter her and then film her corpse and blame the 
   cannibals for it. The cannibals have had enough of the white man's 
   (and women's) violence and make a five course meal of the documentary 
   crew. Seasoning is optional.&nbsp; This is one of the sloppiest-made 
   films in recent memory. There are too many continuity errors to 
   mention (Rick's last name switches from &quot;Wallace&quot; to 
   &quot;Norton&quot;), the &quot;documentary&quot; footage shows Rick 
   filming footage that he shouldn't be seen in (It's a one camera 
   shoot, so where did the second camera come from?) and most of the 
   dubbed dialogue is so cringe-worthy, it's embarrassing (Sample 
   dialogue: &quot;You're a big whore, Grace, but you've got a mind as 
   devious as Caligstro's!&quot;). Since this is an Italian cannibal 
   film, you can also expect disgusting scenes of live animal slaughter. 
   There's really no excuse to do it other than economics (Why kill an 
   expensive special effect when you can kill the real thing?) and I 
   nearly turned the film off when Garcia gutted a live lizard. While 
   the film is bloody, the effects are never convincing (some are 
   downright laughable, including the burning down of the village) and 
   the characters are unrealistic and way too broad to be believable. 
   Bob's transformation from caring conservationist to cold-blooded 
   killer defies explanation and the TV Executive Boardroom scenes, 
   where they discuss ratings and if the footage Grace has sent back has 
   gone &quot;too far&quot; (One executive says, &quot;The law of 
   ratings is devilish!&quot;) is hysterically groan-inducing. While 
   there is plenty of gut-munching and nudity, I would like to think 
   that even the most ardent gorehound would expect something better 
   than this. This is just god-awful. If you must watch a <A HREF="bruno_mattei_films.htm">Bruno

   long stretches where nothing happens. In other words, a typical

   secret government laboratory, disguised as an abandoned house (it's 
   the old haunted &quot;Romero House&quot;) in some podunk town in 
   Illinois, accidentally sets loose a genetically-altered carnivore, or 
   &quot;Carny&quot;, a prototype for a soldier of the future. As the

   lives a living hell? Why, it's good old Carny, hungry for some teen 
   flesh. Scream. Run. Die. Repeat as many times as needed until the 
   film is feature length.&nbsp; Nope, there's not one good thing I can 
   say about this film. Atrociously acted (the two guys who play the 
   bumbling local cops are truly painful to watch), badly photographed 
   (the grain is so noticable, you'll want to play connect the dots) and 
   horribly written and directed by the tag team of Kenneth Mader and F. 
   Joseph Kurtz, <B>CARNIVORE</B> has the look and feel of a student 
   production (Actual on-screen credit: &quot;Assistant to Mr. Mader - 
   His Mom&quot;). The Carnivore is not really a bad creation, it's just 
   filmed to look that way and it's POV shots are achieved by simply 
   pressing the &quot;Solarize&quot; button on the digital camera. There 
   is some gore on view, but it is so hazily filmed (did I mention that 
   it was grainy?), it's hard to make out anything. Why are abandoned 
   houses so smokey? Makes no sense to me. From what I could make out, a 
   face is chewed off, another guy has his guts ripped out and the Carny 
   gets hit in the face with a board with nails sticking out of it. None 
   of it is done very well. Do yourself a favor and find something 
   better to do for 80 minutes. I wish I had. Starring Jill Adcock,

   (2007) -</B> Another low-budget entry in the &quot;torture porn&quot; 
   genre, which I hope soon dies a violent, bloody death. After a gory 
   opening, where we witness an unfortunate young woman dressed in 
   nothing but a pair of dirty bra and panties being beheaded with a 
   hand saw by overweight psycho Bobby Shaw Carver (Eric Fones), while a 
   banjo-heavy version of &quot;Turkey In The Straw&quot; plays on a

   brothers Pete (Matt Carmody) and Bryan (Neil Kubath) and best friends 
   Zach (Jonathan Ruckett) and Rachel (Kristyn Green), as they take a 
   camping vacation. They stop at Billy Hall Carver's (David G. Holland, 
   who looks like Brad Dourif's backwoods cousin) roadhouse for a bite 
   to eat (and a bathroom break) and are soon swayed by Billy Hall (with 
   the promise of $50 and a free night of booze) into cleaning out a 
   ramshackle house in the middle of the woods (yes, these are stupid 
   people). After setting up their tents and meeting fellow camper Kate 
   (Ursula Taherian), who is searching for her missing friend (the girl 
   we saw beheaded in the beginning), the now-quartet head to the house 
   and discover Bobby Shaw's stash of homemade 8mm snuff films, which 
   they all watch, believing them to be cheap slasher films. Only Bryan 
   believes they are real, but he can't convince anyone else, even after 
   finding a human toot<A HREF="carver_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/carver unrated dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>h
    in the woods (Pete tells him to put it under his pillow!). After a 
   night of boozing and karaoke singing (!) at Billy Hall's roadhouse, 
   where Zack gets punched in the face by a patron and Rachel pukes on 
   Pete, Zack is soon killed (or is he?) when he uses the local outhouse 
   to take a crap. Bobby Shaw handcuffs him to the wall, rips the toilet 
   from the floor and dumps shit all over Zack's face (it will make you 
   gag) and then squeezes Zack's balls with a pair of pliers until they 
   burst (an effect that will have every male viewer grabbing their 
   nutsacs in unison). Pete and Bryan go looking for Zack, only to 
   become accidentally trapped in Bobby Shaw's killing shed. Bobby Shaw 
   then kills the still-drunk Rachel next, while Pete and Bryan try to 
   escape the shed (Pete nearly has his arm cut off when the sliding 
   metal door of the shed slams on it). Kate is the next to die after 
   she kills the now-testicle lacking Zack by planting a hoe in his head 
   after mistaking him for Bobby Shaw (a hard thing to do since their 
   physiques are nothing alike!). Bryan finally kills the seemingly 
   unstoppable Bobby Shaw (who survives multiple stabbings, having his 
   eye poked out and being shot point-blank) after witnessing Bobby Shaw 
   torture and kill brother Pete with a sledgehammer (another 
   hard-to-watch sequence), only to realize too late that someone else 
   had to film Bobby Shaw while he killed all his other victims in those 
   snuff films. I wonder who that could be?&nbsp; Impossibly 
   cheap-looking with sound levels that vary from scene-to-scene (you'll 
   be constantly fiddling with the volume control buttons on your remote 
   control, as the music and foley effects are loud and the dialogue is 
   very soft), <B><A HREF="carver_2007b.htm">CARVER</A></B> is the type 
   of film that has very little to recommend except for some extremely 
   bloody gore. Nothing that precedes it will have you prepared for the 
   testicle-squeezing scene, as everything that comes before it is 
   somewhat gory, but not as revealing as this. Nothing is left to the 
   imagination, especially in the Unrated Version (I seriously doubt the 
   R-rated version, which is also available and runs five minutes 
   shorter, contains this scene or many of the others that follow it) 
   and, from that moment on, the film turns into a series of hard-to-watch
    torture scenes, such as when Bobby Shaw hammers a huge nail into 
   various parts of Rachel's body and then removes it with a claw 
   hammer; repeating the torture over-and-over until he finally puts her 
   out of her misery by driving the nail through her forehead. The film 
   suffers immensely because director/screenwriter Franklin Guerrero Jr. (<B><A HREF="8th_plague_2006.htm">THE
    8TH PLAGUE</A></B> - 2006) fails to make Bobby Shaw anything but a 
   fat backwoods slob who seems to do nothing but enjoy killing. No 
   motivations are given for his love of killing or filming his 
   torture/slayings, yet Guerrero (who is also one of five Producers 
   here) keeps piling on a tone of hopelessness for our five young 
   adults, all of them killed by Bobby Shaw, except for Bryan and Kate 
   (who unrealistically shoots herself in the head after discovering the 
   mutilated corpse of her missing friend!), which sets up a final coda 
   that's as obvious as it is frustrating. At least <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B> 
   (2005), a film which clearly influenced this, had the good sense to 
   offer some meat with it's gristle. <B>CARVER</B> is just torture for 
   torture's sake and, while the effects are very well done, the film 
   just rings hollow. Nothing to see here folks, keep moving. Filmed in 
   Virginia, where, apparently (at least according to the joke-filled 
   end credits), underage children routinely worked long, unpaid hours 
   behind the scenes. Also starring Luke Vitale (also a Producer), 
   Natasha Malinsky, Savannah Costello and Stephen Rodgers. An

   [1996]) inherits a castle in Italy from an aunt he never knew he had. 
   John is an ex-alcoholic who killed his five year-old son and blinded 
   his daughter Rebecca (Jessica Dollarhide) in a drunk-driving accident 
   nine months earlier, so he thinks a trip to the castle is just what 
   he needs to put the family back on track again, especially his 
   relationship with his unforgiving wife Susan (Barbara Crampton). 
   Little does he realize that the castle comes with some baggage of 
   it&#146;s own: Namely, a disfigured, castrated creature (Jonathan 
   Fuller) who takes a liking to Rebecca. I don&#146;t want to spoil the 
   story (supplied by frequent Gordon collaborator Dennis Paoli) except 
   to say that there is some graphic sex, extreme gore (a nipple bitten 
   off, oral sex taken to a bloody extreme) and enough plot twists and 
   turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. I happen to think that 
   this is one of the best horror films of 1995, thanks in part to great 
   acting by everyone, excellent on-location photography (by Mario 
   Vulpiani, who shot most of this in an actual Italian castle), a 
   literate screenplay which doesn&#146;t treat the audience as 
   half-witted morons and the sure and steady hand of Stuart Gordon, who 
   knows how to evoke terror out of the simplest of situations. This is

    The film takes place in France at the the end of The Napoleonic Wars

   highway thieves, who will rob anyone<A HREF="castle_of_the_living_dead_1964.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/castle of the living dead british dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   who dare use the roads. Don't worry, it has nothing to do with the 
   film proper, as it's just a plot device to introduce us to former 
   France soldier Eric [Philippe Leroy; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#GangWarMilan1973">GANG
    WAR IN MILAN</A></B> - 1973], who, along with his horse, is nearly 
   run over by a runaway carriage trying to avoid some unseen thieves. 
   Eric then goes to the nearest village, where he watches what looks 
   like a public hanging of a thief. The thief (dressed as a harlequin) 
   refuses to have the noose put around his neck, so the hooded 
   executioner shows him how it is done, putting the noose around his 
   own neck, while the thief kicks the stool the executioner is standing 
   on, hanging the executioner. But all is not how it seems, because 
   this is nothing but a comedic art piece by a troupe of traveling 
   performers. The hooded executioner is Bruno (Jacques Stany; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Scorpion2Tails1982">THE
    SCORPION WITH TWO TAILS</A></B> - 1982), the leader of the troupe, 
   and the harlequin-dressed thief is Dart (our old friend Luciano 
   Pigozzi; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD 
   AND BLACK LACE</A></B> - 1964). Other members of the troupe are the 
   beautiful Laura (Gaia Germani; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#HerculesHauntWrld61">HERCULES
    IN THE HAUNTED WORLD</A></B> - 1961), dwarf Nick (Antonio De

   - 1972) and the towering deaf mute Gianni (Ennio Antonelli; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#WarriorLostWorld83">WARRIOR

   Pogue (Donald Sutherland; <B><A HREF="dont_look_now_1973.htm">DON'T 
   LOOK NOW</A></B> - 1973) wants to know how the hanging trick was 
   done, but no member of the troupe will tell him, making him angry. 
   After the performance is over, Nick is handed a note that states if 
   the troupe comes to the castle of Count Drago and performs their act, 
   he will pay them three gold coins (a lot of money at the time). At 
   the village inn, Dart and Bruno get into an arguement over Dart not 
   thinking he is paid enough and saying that Bruno is cheating him and 
   everyone else out of their fair share. Dart wants to take over the 
   troupe, which leads to a fight between the two where Dart breaks a 
   wine bottle and starts slashing Bruno around his chest and 
   forehead.&nbsp; Just when it looks like Dart is going to kill Bruno, 
   Eric intervenes and Dart runs out of the inn, stealing Eric's horse. 
   Eric has no other choice but to join the troupe (taking Dart's place 
   as the harlequin; but he seems more interested in starting a romance 
   with Laura), as they head to Count Drago's castle. As they are 
   traveling towards the castle in the caravan wagon, Eric notices that 
   there isn't a single sound to be heard, not even the chirping of 
   birds. He then spots a raven perched on a tree branch, not moving, 
   and when he pulls it off the branch, he finds that it is stuffed full 
   of a sawdust-like substance and its eyes look to be made of glass. An 
   old Witch woman (Donald Sutherland again) then appears and talks in 
   rhyme, telling the group that &quot;some will live and some will 
   die&quot; if they go to the castle. She then hands Nick a charm, 
   telling him to keep it on his person always and he will be safe. 
   Rather than heeding the witch's words (they think she is crazy), they 
   continue on their silent journey to the castle, not knowing that the 
   stuffed raven was just an example of what they are about to 
   experience and it could quite possibly mean the death of all of them.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   &quot;The most dangerous animal of all.&quot; Drago hands Bruno the 
   three gold coins as well as a glass of brandy. When Bruno drinks the 
   brandy, it is quite obvious that he has been drugged with something, 
   but the show must go on and when they perform their harlequin hanging 
   play, a groggy Bruno is really hanged and dies (Drago and Sandro 
   laugh and applaud when they see Bruno's lifeless body swinging back 
   and forth on the noose). Eric is instantly suspicious because he saw 
   Bruno in a nearly unconscious state before he performed the hanging 
   routine, but Drago assures them that he will call the police and they 
   will get to the bottom of it all. Dart then arrives at the castle 
   (still dressed in his harlequin uniform) and tries to find a way to 
   sneak in, as he wants his share of the three gold coins (or all of 
   it). He climbs one of the castle walls and peers into Laura's 
   bedroom, but she sees him and screams. Drago orders Sandro to 
   &quot;find&quot; (kill) Dart, and make it quick. We then see Dart 
   exiting the castle's &quot;Mouth Of Hell&quot; and walking into the 
   Witch's home, looking for something to eat. The Witch tells him is is 
   going to die soon and when he walks out of her home, he is killed by 
   Sandro, who is swinging a mighty big scythe.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Drago then tries drugging Eric's coffee, but he refuses to drink it. 
   Drago tells Eric about his experiments and takes him to his 
   laboratory. He tells Eric he was looking for a new and better 
   embalming solution and found it in a rare tropical plant. It is 
   deadly to the living, though, as any human or animal that drinks or 
   ingests a single drop will become instantly paralyzed and their eyes 
   will turn to glass just before they die, but their flesh will become 
   eternally &quot;beautiful&quot; and never decompose (just like the 
   raven). Eric asks Drago what animal he is using the embalming 
   solution on now, but before he can answer, Sgt. Pogue and his equally 
   bumbling small force of officers arrive at the castle. Drago tells 
   Sgt. Pogue that Bruno died in a tragic accident and Pogue takes his 
   word for it. The next day, we see Bruno's casket being carried to the 
   castle's graveyard, but is Bruno's body in it?. Count Drago delivers 
   a very strange religious eulogy at the gravesite, when we watch 
   Sandro, back at the castle, shoot a crossbow bolt dipped in the new 
   embalming solution into Gianni's right eye. Before Gianni can scream, 
   he becomes instantly petrified, his eyes turn to glass (well, one of 
   them does!) and he dies. After the funeral, Sgt. Pogue tells Drago to 
   get rid of the &quot;gypsies&quot; (revealing his racism) and Drago 
   tells him that when he comes back to the castle, they will all be 
   gone. Drago tells Sandro to kill everyone quietly, except for Laura, 
   before Sgt. Pogue comes back. A little while later, Drago says to 
   Laura, &quot;You should never grow old. You should stay this 
   way...forever. Eternal life may be a dream, but eternal beauty can 
   become a reality! (<I>Looking at his embalmed wildlife</I>) Each of 
   these is a step towards immortality.&quot; Laura gets weirded-out by 
   his words and excuses herself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While he is walking outside looking for Dart, the Witch approaches 
   Nick and tells him he will learn how to fly, saying, &quot;I know 
   all. I will meet you at the wall.&quot; Nick becomes afraid and runs 
   away. Sandro tells Eric that Nick fell down and may be hurt badly, 
   but it is all nothing but a ruse so Sandro can knock out Eric with 
   the butt of his pistol. Sandro then delivers a cask of brandy to 
   Laura's bedroom, but when a cat takes a drink of it from her glass, 
   freezes in place and dies instantly, Laura knows that Drago is trying 
   to kill her, so she joins Nick in a search for Eric. In their search 
   of the castle, Laura and Nick find a bedroom that looks like it 
   hasn't been used in decades, but there is an embalmed female corpse 
   in the bed (Holding a hand mirror to look at her beauty) that turns 
   out to be Drago's wife, the Countess. When Drago sees that Laura and 
   Nick have seen his embalmed wife, he orders Sandro to kill Nick and 
   bring Laura to him. Sandro chases Nick and Laura to the castle's 
   roof, where he picks up Nick and throws him off the roof (The first 
   filmic depiction of dwarf tossing!), but Nick lands in a pile of hay 
   by the wall and survives, as the Witch is there to greet him, just as 
   she promised. She drags Nick away to her house. Sandro chases Laura 
   to the castle's tower, where she finds Drago's laboratory. She finds 
   an embalmed Dart, but he is missing his legs (chopped off by Sandro 
   with the scythe). Sandro threatens Laura with a pistol, but Drago 
   stops him from pulling the trigger and orders him to bring Nick to 
   his laboratory.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Witch nurses Nick back to health and tells him that she was one 
   of Drago's &quot;experiments&quot;, but she escaped. She wants Nick 
   to help her stop Drago by any means possible and he agrees. The Witch 
   then taunts Sandro, but when he climbs the Mouth Of Hell's eerie 
   edifice and drops his pistol, Nick picks it up and shoots Sandro, 
   killing him. Drago shows Eric and Laura his &quot;trophy room&quot;, 
   full of embalmed corpses (including Bruno's) in creepy poses. Eric 
   manages to take Drago's pistol away from him, but Sgt. Pogue and his 
   officers arrive and get into a fight with Eric (Pogue believes that 
   Eric and Laura are the killers). Eric convinces Sgt. Pogue to look in 
   the next room, but the Witch appears and makes Drago impale himself 
   on a sword that was dipped in his embalming solution, turning Drago 
   into one of his own &quot;human statues of beauty&quot;. When Sgt. 
   Pogue looks in the trophy room, he frees Eric and Laura (He even 
   helps the Witch up, in one of the first instances of an actor giving 
   himself a lift!). Eric and Laura kiss and then join Nick in the 
   caravan wagon, leaving the castle for good. THE END.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    is one of those films that the IMDb gets all wrong, from how many 
   characters Donald Sutherland portrays (they say three, including an 
   old man, but I couldn't spot him in that role and I watched the film 
   two times in a row!), to whom the real director actually is. The IMDb 
   lists three directors including Warren Kiefer, Luciano Ricci (as 
   &quot;Herbert Wise&quot;) and even Michael Reeves, but if you want to 
   know the truth, I would advise that you read the article on website <A HREF="http://offscreen.com/view/warren_kiefer">OFFSCREEN</A>

   on Italian prints and posters due to labor laws in the country. 
   Michael Reeves (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SheBeast1966">THE SHE BEAST</A></B> 
   - 1966) was actually the Second Unit Director on the film and even 
   puts in a quick cameo as one of Drago's embalmed victims. Still, this 
   is an unusual and rather perverse Italian Gothic horror film, but 
   what one isn't? It's unusual because it paints the dwarf one of the 
   film's heroes (Antonio De Martino also acted under the name &quot;Skip
    Martin&quot; in many British TV Series and films of the '60s &amp; 
   '70s, another mistake IMDb makes in his filmography), who will fight 
   for his and other innocent victim's honor (he puts up a good fight 
   before Sandro tosses him off the roof) and it's perverse due to Count 
   Drago's views on &quot;beauty&quot; and what it entails. It's even 
   implied that he has sexual relations with his embalmed wife's corpse! 
   I love how these Gothic horror films deal with sexual predelictions. 
   While they never came out and called a spade a spade (it was the '60s 
   after all), the inferences are there for the viewer to make up their 
   own minds. This film also uses some real-life locations to their best 
   advantage. The <A HREF="castle_of_the_living_dead_mouth_of_hell_photo_1964.htm">&quot;Mouth

   &quot;Garden Of Bormarzo&quot;. It's creepy as hell and I hope to 
   visit there soon in the very near future (it's on my Bucket List).

    CAT IN THE BRAIN</A><A NAME="CatInTheBrain"></A> (1990) -</B> This 
   horror film, directed, co-scripted and starring the late Lucio Fulci, 
   is about 85% recycled footage from other late-80's Fulci-directed or 
   produced films, but is still interesting nonetheless. Fulci plays a 
   bastardized version of himself, a horror film director named 
   &quot;Lucio Fulci&quot;, who becomes unhinged when he is unable to 
   differentiate the gory violence in his films with <A HREF="cat_in_the_brain_1990c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cat in the brain dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>real
    life. Fulci goes to a psychiatrist, Professor Egon Schwarz (David L. 
   Thompson), to discuss his problem (The Professor's receptionist 
   recognizes him and calls up a friend, telling her that she hopes he 
   gives her a part in his next horror film!) and the Professor tells 
   him that his mind is breaking down the boundaries between fantasy and 
   reality. Fulci goes to the set (at the real Cinecitta Studios in 
   Rome) of his newest flick, a Nazi horror film, and finds a 
   documentary crew waiting to make a film on his life and movies. He 
   loses it and attacks the documentary crew and nearly rapes the female 
   interviewer while in some kind of trance (He apologizes to the woman 
   and she says, &quot;I really never had such a thrill in my 
   life!&quot;). Professor Schwarz watches all of Fulci's films (as 
   research) and hypnotizes Fulci to &quot;curb this tendency you have 
   to pass over the boundaries between reality and fantasy&quot;. It 
   turns out that the Professor is actually the madman, though. He 
   conditions Fulci (with an electronic bell tone) to believe that he is 
   responsible for a series of brutal murders that are happening in the 
   area, when it is, in fact, the Professor committing them. We watch 
   the psychopathic Professor cut off some poor woman's fingers with a 
   switchblade and then cut her head off with an axe while making Fulci 
   believe he is actually responsible. As Fulci sinks deeper and deeper 
   into paranoia (his producer, Filipio [Shillet Angel], is forced to 
   shoot scenes of the new horror film by himself), we learn the reason 
   why the Professor is murdering all these people: His unfaithful wife, 
   Katya (Melissa Longo), flaunts her affairs in front of her husband 
   and killing other women (and a few men) is his way of dealing with 
   it. He uses Fulci's films as blueprints for his murders, as if to say 
   violent films cause violence in real-life (He says that same exact 
   thing out loud at one point in the film, only in a sarcastic manner). 
   Thankfully, Fulci has a police inspector (Jeoffrey Kennedy) following 
   his every move and catches the Professor trying to set Fulci up. The 
   cops kill the Professor and Fulci sails away (with the Professor's 
   receptionist!) on his sailboat (named &quot;Perversion&quot;). A 
   sound of a chainsaw below deck proves that Fulci is not as innocent 
   as we are led to believe. Or is he?&nbsp; One gets the feeling when 
   watching this film that Fulci was trying to tell his financial 
   backers and fans that he was burned-out and tired of making gore 
   films and it comes across loud and clear. While this film is gory as 
   hell, Fulci uses the blood as a means of demeaning the horror genre 
   rather than to defend it. Fulci was qui<A HREF="cat_in_the_brain_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cat in the brain dvd front12 small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="201" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>te

   after he murders his 17th victim. Devlon's psychiatrist, Dr. Cardan 
   (Hugo Stiglitz; <B><A HREF="masacre_en_el_rio_tula_1985.htm">MASSACRE

   stop his reign of terror, the doctor feeling that Devlon is the 
   personification of evil. The Police Captain thinks Dr. Cardan is the 
   one who is crazy and refuses his request. Three horny medical 
   students and their girlfriends have a party in an abandoned house, 
   which happened to be Devlon's hideout, and one of the students, Jorge 
   (Cervando Manzetti), finds Devlon's satanic bible. Jorge gets the 
   bright idea of stealing Devlon's body out of the morgue and bringing 
   it to the cemetery (which, uncoincidentally, sits right next to the 
   abandoned house), where he and his horny partygoers plan on repeating 
   phrases from the satanic bible in some kind of amateur Black Mass. 
   They couldn't have picked a better time to perform their ritual, 
   since it is Halloween Night and they are not alone in the cemetery.

   Cardan discovers Devlon's <A HREF="cemetery_of_terror_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cemetery of terror mexican poster small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>body
    missing from the morgue, he and the Police Captain drive around, 
   waiting for the violence to start. They won't have to wait long. When 
   Jorge reads some verses over Devlon's corpse, nothing happens at 
   first other than a bad thunderstorm, so the six partiers head for the 
   abandoned house, where they drink and have sex, unaware that Devlon 
   has risen from the dead and he now has the power to be invisible (!). 
   Devlon goes back to his hideout, where he starts to kill the sextet 
   responsible for his ressurection. He slashes the throat of one girl, 
   rips open the stomach of one of the guys, pulls out the intestines of 
   another girl, impales Jorge against a wall, slashes the last girl 
   about the body and face and plants an axe in the last guy's face. 
   Devlon then turns his attention to the children in the graveyard. The 
   quick-thinking of young Tony (Eduardo Capetillo) buys the kids some 
   time until Dr. Cardan arrives and tells the kids that they must burn 
   Devlon's book. With the house surrounded by hordes of the living 
   dead, the kids and Dr. Cardan try to burn the book before they are 
   all killed.&nbsp; This film, the first directorial effort by Ruben 
   Galindo Jr. (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Don'tPanic1987">DON'T PANIC</A></B> 
   - 1987; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#GraveRobbers1989">GRAVE ROBBERS</A></B> 
   - 1989), contains a lot of elements lifted directly from <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
   (1978) to be considered &quot;original&quot; (Dr. Cardan could easily 
   be Dr. Loomis and Devlon a substitute for Michael Myers), but one 
   thing this film has that <B>HALLOWEEN</B> didn't is gore. Lots and 
   lots of gore. Like Michael, Devlon is an unstoppable killing machine 
   but, unlike Michael, Devlon likes to use his hands for most of his 
   killings, ripping out throats and thrusting his fists into torsos and 
   pulling out internal organs. Not much is left to the imagination here 
   and I particularly liked the scene where Tony pulls the axe out of 
   Pedro's (Andres Garcia Jr.) head and there's a piece of brain matter 
   hanging off the blade. Two-thirds of the way through the film, it 
   becomes a different kettle of fish, as Devlon performs a ceremony and 
   all the dead in the cemetery rise from their graves to terrorize the 
   children. This injection of the supernatural provides the film with a 
   distinct voice, as we witness young children being chased by the 
   undead (the makeups are very good) and the cemetery gates magically 
   grow so the children can't climb over them (like a cemetery prison). 
   There is also a scene that reminded me of <B><A HREF="horror_hotel_1960.htm">HORROR
    HOTEL</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="city_of_the_dead_1960.htm">CITY OF

   to rescue the children, only to have a tree fall on him (!). As the 
   children ask him if he's OK, he replies, &quot;Run, children, 
   everything's lost!&quot; Wow, way to comfort the kids! Proving that 
   it's not just American horror films to give us a &quot;surprise&quot; 
   final coda to set up a sequel, this one does, too, but a sequel was 
   never made. <B>CEMETERY OF TERROR</B> is nothing outstanding, but it 
   is a fun little gore film that doesn't skimp on the red stuff. Also 
   starring Usi Velasco, Erika Buenfil, Edna Bolkin, Rene Cardona III 
   and Cesar Velasco. The fullscreen print on the double feature Deimos 
   Entertainment DVD (with Galindo's <B>GRAVE ROBBERS</B>) is full of 
   emulsion scratches and has a red tint in spots (probably from 
   improper storage), but that just adds to the film's atmosphere. It's 
   beat-up, but watchable. <B>Not Rated.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

    -</B> A female college professor Pam (Robin Sims), her teenage 
   students and lover/older student Jay (Jay Richardson) decide to clean 
   up an abandoned mining camp where something horrible happened years 
   before. Despite warnings by local bar owner Jack (top-billed Richard 
   Harrison, who is not even mentioned about being in this film on <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</A>),
    the motley (and horny) group hike up to the site despite one of 
   them, Scott (David Homb), having visions of death and grand-mal 
   convulsions. They find footprints of a strange creature with three 
   toes and long, sharp rubbery fingers. Pam and Jay are attacked while 
   making love by some unseen entity. After one of the students breaks 
   his arm after trying to ride a horse (don't ask), Pam and Jay send 
   him back down to the town with one of the students. The rest of the 
   group run <A HREF="channeler_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channeler vhs front medium.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>into
    Arnie (the always unwelcome Dan Haggerty) and his dog. Arnie (who is 
   a parapsychologist!) tells the group about the history of the mine 
   and how in the 1840's the entire mining community disappeared and 
   were killed by something the miners found, something which Pam failed 
   to tell her students. Arnie is also a lifelong resident of this 
   community and runs blood tests on the students, trying to find some 
   unknown thing (to us) that he isn't telling the rest of the group. We 
   also find out that Arnie is Jack's brother. Scott has another vision 
   and says: &quot;The gate must be sealed. The price must be 
   paid.&quot;, before the two who were sent down the mountain are 
   attacked and killed by three creatures in black robes, called 
   Darklings (It's not mentioned in the film, only in the closing 
   credits). With Arnie's help, Pam confesses that she knew about the 
   history of the mine to her students. It turns out Scott is a 
   Channeler, a person who can conjure up entities from a past life. Pam 
   knew about Scott's abilities and decided to use his talents to find 
   out the truth about what happened to the miners. Before Pam is able 
   to tell him, Scott disappears and everyone (besides Arnie) goes out 
   looking for him. Arnie continues to run his blood experiments and 
   finds out something about one of the students. The group finds Scott 
   at the entrance of the mine, possessed by an entity and tells 
   everyone that the main creature is now loose and will start killing 
   unless the gate is closed by a direct blood decendent of the one who 
   opened it. Arnie is attacked by one of the creatures while riding to 
   the rescue on his motorcycle and kills a creature with a flare gun. 
   He sends his dog (!) to go get his brother Jack and then dies. Pam 
   and Jay are kidnapped by the black-robed creatures, who plan to cut 
   out their hearts so the gate will stay open forever. Jack shows up in 
   the nick of time (it seems he is the decendent needed to close the 
   gate), while a possessed Scott diverts the creatures while Jack 
   closes the gate by giving up his life by blowing up the mine with a 
   hand grenade. Directed without any flair by Grant Austin Waldman (his 
   first directorial gig, he would later make the unfunny horror comedy <B><A HREF="teenage_exorcist_1991.htm">TEENAGE
    EXORCIST</A></B> - 1991, and the disasterous actioner <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Gator King">GATOR
    KING</A></B> - 1996). There's hardly any blood, no nudity and the 
   final shot of the head Darkling is a hilarious thing to see. It's a 
   rubber concoction that looks like a cross between <B><A HREF="boogens_1981.htm">THE
    BOOGENS</A></B> (1981) and the original version of <B><A HREF="fly_1958.htm">THE
    FLY</A></B> (1958). My so-called friend Will Wilson sent me this 
   film because he knows how much I love Dan Haggerty (NOT!!!). 
   Thankfully, Haggerty doesn't show up until the halfway mark and is 
   dispatched rather quickly. I say not quickly enough. Will, I will get 
   even!. This film is only recommended for fans of Jay Richardson, a 
   fun and respected actor of many films and commercials, who is a 
   regular in a lot of Fred Olen Ray's films (who gets an &quot;Executive
    Consultant&quot; credit here). The acting on the whole is competent 
   (Haggerty excluded), but the story makes no sense and the plot hangs 
   ever so tenderly by a thread (Like: Why does backwater town bar owner 
   Jack drive a Porsche? Where did the horse come from?). Not as bad as 
   Waldman's other films, it's just one way of spending 90 minutes of 
   your life. Another way would be scratching your ass until it bleeds. 
   Also starring Oliver Darrow, Brenda James, Charles Solomon, Tom Shell 
   and Waldman himself as one of the Darklings. A <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Magnum Entertainmen">Magnum

   college girls, Angelica (Maya Barovich) and Emily (Chantal Degroat), 
   head to an all-night rave in the woods, only to be captured by 
   sadistic meth-heads Chaos (Kevin Gage; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LaidToRest2009">LAID

   Ecstasy) to enhance their music experience and they ask Swan to hook 
   them up. He brings them to a cabin in the woods, where Chaos and his 
   goons (Swan is Chaos' son) throw the girls in the back of their van, 
   drive to a secluded section of the woods and begin an uncomfortably 
   long session of rape and torture on the two girls. Believe me when I

   beyond the boundaries of good taste (some would say it goes beyond 
   the boundaries of bad taste), as Emily's interracial parents, black 
   mom Justine (Deborah Lacey) and white dad Leo (Scott Richards), 
   discuss crashing the rave (they decide against it because they trust 
   their daughter), while Emily and Angelica are brutalized and raped. 
   When Angelica kicks Frankie in the nuts when he tries to force her to 
   give him a blowjob, it gives the two girls a chance to escape, but 
   Angelica is quickly recaptured. Chaos cuts off one of her nipples 
   with a hunting knife and forces her to eat it (she vomits soon 
   after), stabs her repeatedly in her back, killing her, and then 
   sodomizes her corpse while the other three watch in disgust. Frankie 
   is apparently not too disgusted , as he takes his turn at sloppy 
   seconds. When Emily never answers her cell phone (she conveniently 
   left it in Angelica's car), Justine and Leo call the police, who tell 
   them that the girls are probably drunk and met a couple of guys 
   (proving once again that police in these kinds of films are masters 
   of consolation). It's obvious that the cops aren't about to lift a 
   finger to help (One of the cops, a raving racist, says to his 
   partner, &quot;How would you go around life being half a nigger?&quot;
    when describing Emily), so Justine and Leo go looking for Emily and 
   Angelica. They find Angelica's car and then discover Angelica's 
   bloody corpse, but Emily (who stabs Swan in the balls, forcing Chaos 
   to kill him to put him out of his misery) is recaptured by Chaos, 
   stripped naked, hog-tied and then has a big hunting knife shoved up 
   her ass (While she recites the Lord's Prayer, which never seems to 
   work at all in horror films besides <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE EXORCIST</A></B>

   Frankie walk to the nearest house looking to steal a car. Guess whose 
   house they pick? Let the revenge begin, but those expecting an ending

   hard to defend a film that lacks any basic core of emotion and <B><A HREF="chaos_2003b.htm">CHAOS</A></B>

   in this, but then changed his mind when he decided that this film 
   wasn't going to be a straight-ahead remake (don't let that fool you; 
   this is basically the same film with a different, totally ridiculous 
   ending). DeFalco thought that adding racial tension into the mix 
   would make his film more &quot;relevant&quot; (yeah, 
   &quot;nigger&quot; remarks by a racist cop is just what we need in 
   horror films today!), but anyone with half a brain can see that he 
   doesn't have a clue on how to handle the issue and comes off as being 
   an unintentional racist himself by letting Chaos be the only survivor 
   of the film! The finale is so hamfisted that I wanted to kick-in my 
   TV screen, as Chaos kills Daisy with a shotgun blast, Leo kills 
   Frankie with a chainsaw, the racist cop shoots Leo in the head, 
   Justine shoots the racist cop, Chaos then shoots the racist cop's 
   partner and then turns the shotgun on Justine. The film fades to 
   black, where we then hear a shotgun blast and then the sound of Chaos 
   laughing. What exactly is the message here? Bad things happen to good 
   people? We see that in the news every day; we don't need to see it in 
   the movies. Though not a badly-made film, <B>CHAOS</B> is instantly 
   disposable fodder that fails to satisfy even on the most basic level, 
   unless you are a sadist. Skip it and watch the original or its very

   inopportune times). It becomes apparent after a short while that the 
   children have become infected with some unknown organism that is 
   slowly turning them into homicidal maniacs and Paulie seems to become 
   the leader of the pack. At first it's small things, like killing the 
   family cat Jinxie or trying to hobble Elaine with a runaway sled, but 
   things turn absolutely bloody when Robbie is killed in a sledding 
   &quot;accident&quot; set-up by the kids (he slides head-first into a 
   garden hoe and is scalped). The children, except for Miranda, then 
   run into the woods and Casey goes chasing after them, only to fall 
   into a puddle of goo which may be the cause of the infection (the 
   infection is never completely defined), Soon, the children are 
   separating the adults, as Paulie breaks mom Elaine's leg on the 
   monkey bars, Leah (who has stolen Robbie's corpse and has inserted 
   one of her dolls in his stomach, which she has graphically slit-open) 
   traps Chloe in a tent (she is eventually stabbed in the eye with a 
   spike by Nicky) and Miranda manages to convince daddy Jonah that 
   Casey is responsible for it all (Kids blaming a teenager. There's a 
   new one!). When everyone else is dead, Elaine and Casey try to drive 
   to safety, but as we (and, eventually, Elaine) will find out, the 
   infection has spread and it is now not just limited to children.&nbsp;
    This effective little British horror film (not to be confused with 
   Max Kalmanowicz's 1980 horror film <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Children1980">THE
    CHILDREN</A></B>, also about infected killer kids), directed and 
   written by Tom Shankland (<B><A HREF="killing_gene_2006.htm">THE 
   KILLING GENE</A></B> - 2006), is a highly uncomfortable mixture of 
   bloodshed caused at the hands of little children and how easily it is 
   for the adults to jump to the wrong conclusions, blaming teenager 
   Casey for the killings because she is &quot;moody&quot; (She has a 
   tattoo of an aborted baby next to her navel to signify how she was 
   Elaine's unwanted daughter). The violence committed by and to the 
   children is quite brutal and since no real scientific reason is given 
   for the infection (Robbie does speak a throwaway line about how 
   hundreds of new viruses are discovered every week, but this is before 
   anyone is infected), those looking for a film that gives explanations 
   or shies away from showing children killed (Paulie is impaled on a 
   pane of broken glass; Nicky gets his throat impaled on a shard of 
   wood; Miranda is crushed by a car) should stay away from this movie. 
   Those more daring will find much to like here, as <B><A HREF="children_2008.htm">THE
    CHILDREN</A></B> has a lot to say about the parent/child dynamic 
   (especially about playing favorites) and how young kids can get away 
   with cold-blooded murder because, hey, they're fucking kids and lack 
   the capacity to kill, right? The acting (even by the children) is 
   uniformly excellent, the killings are well done (thanks to some 
   intelligent editing) and the music soundtrack adds to the creepy 
   atmosphere. Also unusual for a horror film is that this film takes 
   place almost entirely during the day and yet it still manages to give 
   you the chills. If the final image doesn't manage to raise some 
   goosebumps and send the hair on the back of your neck reaching for

    hard to believe that this franchise made it to seven films. This is 
   the sixth in the series and, while it isn't the worst, it comes 
   damned close. Hannah (Natalie Ramsey) is having visions and decides 
   to go back to Gatlin, Nebraska to look for answers, where 19 years

   - 1984). A couple of miles before she hits town, she picks up a 
   preacher called Zachariah (Gary Bullock), who proceeds to tell her 
   the biblical meaning of her name and then vanishes into thin air, 
   causing a startled Hannah to crash her car. She is taken to the 
   Gatlin hospital by unfriendly female cop Cora (Alix Koromzay), where 
   Dr. Michaels (Stacy Keach) tends to her wounds and seems to be the 
   only adult over the age of 25 who isn't in a coma or crazy as a loon. 
   It seems the town was waiting for Hannah's return, as she is the 
   &quot;Chosen One&quot;, the only person that can wake comatose Isaac 
   (John Franklin), the original cult leader of the Children of the 
   Corn. When Isaac awakens, a chain of bloody events begins in which 
   Hannah discovers that all the children in town are the children of 
   the original film's kids and she is needed for the cult to achieve 
   it's dastardly prophecy. With the help of Gabriel (Paul Popowich), 
   Hannah tries to flee town, but ends up fulfilling the prophecy 
   instead. She broke the horror film rule: Never trust anyone named 
   Gabriel. Didn't she see <B><A HREF="prophecy_1995.htm">THE PROPHECY</A></B> 
   (1995)? This film spends too much of it's scant 82 minutes building 
   up to the first kill (which occurs at the 40 minute mark), filling us 
   with meaningless supernatural mumbo-jumbo, false scares and &quot;plot
    development&quot;. Nancy Allen shows up as Hannah's birth mother 
   Rachel, the only other unaffected adult in town, who has been taking 
   care of the town's children until Isaac's return. It's a thankless 
   role. John Franklin returns from the first film as Isaac, giving the 
   film some creedence, but the screenplay (co-written by Franklin) is 
   drab and fairly routine. Speaking of routine, the violence in this 
   film is unimaginative, consisting of an electrocution, a slit throat, 
   a branding, a body split in two by a machete (it sounds more bloody 
   than it is) and a suicide by scythe, the film's highlight. Director 
   Kari Skogland, who would later make the vastly superior <B><A HREF="liberty_stands_still_2002.htm">LIBERTY

    lame exercise in the supernatural, always promising more than it 
   ever could deliver. Besides a few decent kills over seven films, it 
   never offered-up much of a mythology that could sustain such a long 
   reign. In this film, Claudette Milk portrays Jamie Lowell, who 
   travels from California to Nebraska to check up on her grandmother 
   who was staying at the condemned Hampton Arms, a run-down boarding 
   house with a cornfield for a backyard (Uh-oh!). Her grandmother has 
   disappeared, so Jamie does the sensible thing (?) and stays in her 
   grandma's room, hoping to find out what has happened to her. The 
   house and the surrounding area are occupied by children who stare 
   blankly into space (but can play the amusement game House Of The Dead 
   like champs at the local 7-11!). The adults in the area refuse to 
   talk to Jamie about her grandmother or the children and the tenants 
   in the boarding house are straight out of stereotypes 101: There's 
   Jerry (Troy Yorke), the pot-smoking manager; Tiffany (Crystal Lowe), 
   a stripper who works at the airport bar; Stan (Michael Rogers), a 
   gun-toting man who keeps a locked room in the basement and wears 
   night vision goggles, and the Cranky Man (John Destry), an old man 
   who zooms up and down the hallways in his wheelchair while yelling 
   obscenities at everyone. They are all fodder for the children. And 
   who is this priest (Michael Ironside) that seems to be around 
   everytime something weird happens? As Jamie digs deeper into the 
   mystery, she discovers some interesting facts about her grandmother's 
   and her parents' pasts that have bearing on what is about to happen 
   to her. Yawn. Pee. Yawn. Repeat as needed. This is basic DTV fare 
   which really offers very little entertainment to the viewer. The 
   kills are bloodless and boring, the best being Tiffany's death in the 
   bathtub as one of the children thrown corn kernels in her tub and she 
   is drowned by the cornstalks that grow from them. There's also a 
   decapitated head (only seen after the fact), a heart attack and a man 
   falling down a stairwell, all of it sterile. While the acting is OK, 
   the script (by S.J. Smith) gives the actors very little to do except 
   look scared or look scary. I ask you: Is this any way to treat a 
   horror fan? He who walks behind the rows is nevermore. Until some 
   ninkompoop film executive tries again, that is. Also starring Sean

   And we found our ninkompoops. This is the 8th film in the series and 
   also the worst. It is obvious the the Weinstein Brothers and 
   Dimension Films were about to lose the rights to the <B><A HREF="children_of_the_corn_1984.htm">CORN</A></B>

   The film opens in September of 1973, 20 miles from Gatlin, Nebraska,

   (He totally misses the human finger in a pitcher of lemonade!). A 
   young boy dressed as a girl stabs Cole with a knife in one of the 
   bedrooms on the second floor and he falls out a window. Cut to the 
   present day, where married couple Tim (Tim Rock) and Allie (Kelen 
   Coleman; HBO's <B><A HREF="newsroom_tv_series_2012.htm">THE NEWSROOM</A></B> 
   [2012 - 2014]) have their car break down in the middle of nowhere in 
   Nebraska. Since Allie is pregnant and no cars have come near them in 
   hours, they decide to take a walk when they notice some telephone 
   poles in the distance. Hoping to find a phone, they come upon a 
   run-down shack occupied by Preacher (Billy Drago, in one of his 
   biggest roles in years) and his nymphomaniac Ukranian wife Oksana 
   (Barbara Nedeljakova; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B> 
   - 2005 and <B><A HREF="hostel_part_2_2007.htm">HOSTEL PART II</A></B> 
   - 2007). At first, Preacher refuses to let them in, but relents when 
   he discovers that Allie is pregnant. Once inside the shack, the first 
   thing they notice is that the living room has a huge flat screen TV 
   hooked up to a digital camera (it's not that unusual when you have a 
   wife who is a nymphomaniac!). While Tim makes a phone call in the 
   kitchen to get help for their car, Oksana starts exposing herself to 
   him, which makes Tim very uncomfortable. Even more uncomfortable is 
   Allie, who is being asked personal questions by Preacher about her 
   pregnancy (We find out later in the film that Allie once had an 
   abortion). After discovering that no one can come and fix their car 
   until tomorrow morning, Tim and Allie have no choice but to stay with 
   Preacher and his horny wife. Allie sneaks out at night and discovers 
   a small metal barn with some pews and a ritual altar (with dolls made 
   out of corn stalks) and then a locked shack that contains a child 
   (Dusty Burwell), with strange psychic powers (are there any other 
   kind?). It turns out that Preacher is actually the soldier Cole, who 
   we saw in the beginning of the film and he's keeping the child 
   locked-up until he can find another child to replace him. Now I 
   wonder where he will find that child? Hmmmmm....... Allie and Tim try 
   to flee the area when their car is fixed by mechanic Pritchett (Duane 
   Whitaker; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#From Dusk 2">FROM DUSK TILL

   the film, just coasting by to earn a paycheck. The only interesting

   who comes to check out the property, only to be supernaturally thrust 
   into the sky (seems like the police in this territory don't even send 
   out a search party when one of their officers turns up missing!). We 
   learn what actually happens to him during the final credits. The film 
   runs a scant 81 minutes, of which six minutes are credits, so it is a 
   long time to wait for the only semi-funny thing in the movie. Just do

   a barn with a local cop (Martin Schiff, who has the most distracting 
   birthmark since Gorbachev) when he is bitten by zombie Abbott Hayes 
   (A. Barrett Worland). The local cop flees the scene thinking Savini 
   has killed Hayes before killing himself. He was wrong.&nbsp; Cut to

   car dealership. The local cop is now the sheriff and is in cahoots 
   with the owner of the car dealership to cut corners and get the job 
   done as soon as possible. The owner sends his son (Damien Luvara) to 
   town to oversee the project. Sooner than you can say &quot;zombie 
   dinner&quot;, Abbott Hayes starts turning the local population into 
   the undead. The rest of the film is your standard &quot;undead vs. 
   alive&quot; scenario, only done so poorly that boredom sets in rather 
   quickly. The ending leaves it wide open for a sequel. Let's hope not. 
   Someone should start a petition to stop John Russo (who produced this

   time they've stopped riding on George Romero's coattails and give up 
   the ghost. About the only decent thing about this film are the makeup 
   effects by Vincent J. Guastini (who cameos as a construction worker). 
   The acting, direction (by Tor A. Ramsey) and screenplay (by Karen Lee 
   Wolf) are all sub-par. Consider this: If the best actor here is Tom 
   Savini (who also served as Stunt Coordinator), how good can this

   within its walls, like all the other big Catholic churches. The only 
   people buried there are the church's builders.), when he discovers 
   that the parchment was written in a long-forgotten language that has 
   been mirrored, so he uses a mirror to translate it. It tells him that 
   he must find the &quot;stone with the seven eyes&quot;. But why?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Evan begins searching through the church's library for a mention of 
   the stone and it is at this time when nearly everyone in the church, 
   including Father Gus (Hugh Quarshie; <B><A HREF="nightbreed_1990.htm">NIGHTBREED</A></B> 
   - 1990), begin seeing and hearing things (like the sound of horses 
   running down the pews) that can't possibly be there. Evan finds the 
   stone on the giant crucifix that guards the mass grave and he removes 
   it. Big Mistake. A hole opens up in the shape of a giant cross, a 
   hole which may travel down to the abyss of Hell. Adam pulls a shroud 
   out of the hole which contains the remains of a Knight who fell in 
   the mass grave and it suddenly comes to life, its decomposing hand 
   squeezing Evan's neck, when it suddenly stops. It is obvious Evan is 
   now possessed by some demon entity (he rips open his chest and pulls 
   out his own heart, yet he doesn't die!). He then kills Lotte's 
   father, Hermann, the Sacristan (Roberto Corbiletto; a Sacristan is a 
   person in charge of the church's sacred vessels, vestments, etc.), 
   who has come to the church basement looking for Lotte (earlier in the 
   film, he calls Lotte a slut and accuses her of drinking). It is at 
   this time that the film loses its linear narrative, as it turns into 
   sequences of WTF?!? horror.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Lisa sees a goatman monster (an image usually associated with the 
   Devil) in her bedroom window (which then shatters) and calls the 
   police. When they arrive, all they see is a scared woman. Lotte 
   witnesses a possessed Evan trying to rape Lisa and she acts like 
   nothing is wrong (as a matter of fact, she paints her nails in front 
   of Evan!). Evan goes all <B><A HREF="shining_1980.htm">SHINING</A></B>-like
    by typing the number &quot;6&quot; over and over on his typewriter 
   and then tries to kill Lotte, but she escapes and runs into her 
   father, who is now possessed. He washes her mouth out with soap (!) 
   for daring to speak ill of Evan. After trying to kill Father Gus in a 
   confessional, Hermann commits suicide&nbsp; in the church basement by 
   impaling himself with a jackhammer (!), his flowing blood triggering 
   an ancient booby-trap that puts the entire church in lockdown, 
   trapping everyone inside. This includes a bridal model (Antonella 
   Vitale) on a professional photo shoot; a biker named Freddie (Roberto 
   Caruso) and his girlfriend Mira (Olivia Cupisti); a school full of 
   young children on a tour of the church; and an old couple, Heinrich 
   (John Karlsen) and his wife (Katherine Bell Marjorie).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's not long before some of the trapped inhabitants become demons 
   (This film was originally going to be titled <B>DEMONS 3</B>, a 
   second <A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#Demons2-1986">sequel</A> 
   to Lamberto Bava's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Demons1985">DEMONS</A></B> 
   [1985], but the director did not want this film to be associated with 
   that film because his film was not &quot;pizza schlock&quot;! I guess 
   he forgot to pass this piece of information to Germany, who released 
   this film on DVD under the <B><A HREF="church_1989.htm#Demons3TheChurch">DEMONS

    III: THE OGRE</A></B> - 1989). The bridal model is bloodily impaled 
   by the spikes of an iron gate wielded by a reanimated Hermann. 
   Freddie sees a naked Mira in the grip of a religious statue of a 
   winged angel come to life (an image taken from a famous Boris Vallejo 
   painting, but this image has been used in many religious horror 
   films, including <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Curse IV">CURSE IV: THE

   - 1988], also featuring Feodor Chaliapin). The Bishop is aware of 
   what is going on, telling Father Gus that this wasn't the first time 
   this has happened, but when Father Gus is not satisfied with his 
   explanation, especially when the Bishop says, &quot;I am the 
   church!&quot;, they get into a scuffle, which results in the Bishop 
   falling to his death, impaled on a sharp grave marker. Mira falls 
   through a hole in the church floor, hanging on to Freddie's grip, but 
   she has her face and brains splattered against the window of a 
   traveling subway car! Much more weird stuff happens, including Lisa 
   tearing the skin off her face when she sees herself as an old hag in 
   a mirror. There is also an appearance of a gooey 
   lizard/demon/gargoyle creature., but you'll be saying the same thing 
   as Father Gus, when he yells out, &quot;I don't understand!&quot;, 
   but I guarantee you'll never be bored.<A HREF="church_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/church vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A></FONT></FONT><BR>

   The print is flawless and the colors pop, making it look better than 
   it ever has before. It's also a hoot to see Asia Argento at such a 
   young age (she was 15 when this film was made, but she looks much 
   younger). The extras on the Blu-Ray include new 2017 interviews with 
   Michele Soavi and Asia Argento, both informative. We discover that 
   Soavi painted the church's grotesque frescos and he tried to copy the 
   style of Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch (he succeeded) and 
   that it was filmed at a real church in Budapest (Soavi tried to film 
   it at a church in Nuremberg, Germany, but the town didn't want a 
   horror film to be made there. There are still some scenes in the film 
   that were shot there). Soavi also explains that the late Keith 
   Emerson did the <A HREF="church_1989.htm#OST">music soundtrack</A>, 
   but, even though his music was beautiful, it didn't fit within in the 
   confines or the &quot;feel&quot; of the film, so the soundtrack was 
   composed and recorded by The Goblins, who also did the music for 
   Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP RED</A></B> 
   (1975), <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
   (1977) and many other Italian genre films. Asia Argento remembers 
   that the church had to be deconsecrated every morning so they could 
   film the &quot;most heinous things&quot;. She also says that when she 
   was a kid, she was not easily shocked. With a father like Dario, I 
   can understand why. She also remembers that Antonella Vitale, the 
   Bridal Model, was her father's girlfriend at the time. Asia looks at 
   her horror film career with reverence and humor, which is refreshing.

    plot, you'll remember this film for the bloody deaths long after the 
   film concludes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens up with Father Thomas (Fabrizio Jovine; Fulci's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1979) walking around a graveyard in the fictional 
   town of Dunwich (actually filmed in Savannah, Georgia). The camera 
   then pans to a tombstone which has this inscription on it: &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">The
    Soul That Pines for Eternity shall outspan Death. You, Dweller of 
   the Twilight Void, come</FONT></B>&quot; and then we watch as the 
   good Father throws a rope around a tree branch and hangs himself. 
   This act of cowardice puts the whole town of Dunwich in deep trouble. 
   While Father Thomas is hanging himself, there is a seance, performed 
   by Mary Woodhouse (Katriona MacColl; <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE BEYOND</A></B> 
   - 1981; <B><A HREF="horsehead_2014.htm">HORSEHEAD</A></B> - 2014), 
   going on clear across town. Mary &quot;sees&quot; Father Thomas 
   committing suicide and dies of fright (don't worry, this is not the 
   last we will see of Mary or of Father Thomas).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The police show up to investigate Mary's death and Sgt. Clay (Martin 
   Sorrentino; Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Manhattan Baby">MANHATTAN
    BABY</A></B> - 1982) interrogates Theresa (Adelaide Aste), an 
   elderly woman who was at the seance. She tells Sgt. Clay that Mary's 
   death had to do with an ancient black magic text called &quot;The 
   Book Of Enoch&quot;, which is older than the Bible. She also tells 
   him that the worst is yet to come. Sgt. Clay only believes in what he 
   can touch, but he witnesses flames shoot up from the floor, which 
   should change his mind (But it doesn't. He believes it was a trick 
   performed by the mediums.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see town loony, Bob (Giovanni Lombardo Radice; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Cannibal Apoc">CANNIBAL
    APOCALYPSE</A></B> - 1980; <B><A HREF="violent_shit_the_movie_2015.htm">VIOLENT

   &quot;John Morghen&quot;), entering a seemingly empty house, looking 
   for a place to sleep. He finds a female blow-up doll (he fondles it 
   like it was a real woman!) and then discovers a rotting corpse 
   covered in worms (it doesn't scare him away, since he needs a place 
   to sleep!). We are then taken to Junie's Lounge, a bar in Dunwich. 
   The customers are talking about Father Thomas and how the town hasn't 
   been the same since his suicide. The bar owner, Junie, tells them 
   that it is all in their minds since all the descendants of the town's 
   original founders were Salem witch burners, but even he has no 
   explanation of why the mirror behind the bar shatters by itself and 
   one of the bar's concrete walls cracks in half. This will not be the 
   last time we are in Junie's lounge.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nosy newspaper reporter Peter Bell (the late Christopher George; <B><A HREF="grizzly_1976.htm">GRIZZLY</A></B> 
   - 1976; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> - 1982) 
   is looking for a story, so he decides to make Mary's death his next 
   one. He attends her burial (which no one but himself attends!) and 
   watches as the grave diggers stop putting dirt over her coffin for a 
   dinner break! In a series of coincidences which are too hard to 
   overlook, Mary wakes up in her coffin and starts screaming (Didn't 
   the funeral parlor ever hear of embalming?). Peter hears her and 
   without any care for Mary's safety, begins chopping away at the 
   casket with a pick-axe and frees Mary from her dirt prison. Back at 
   Mary's house, Theresa tells Peter and Mary that when Father Thomas 
   committed suicide on consecrated ground, he opened the Gates of Hell. 
   The only way to close the Gates is to dig up Father Thomas' grave and 
   take his body off of the consecrated grounds. She also tells them 
   that they will have to do it before Monday, which is All Saints' Day. 
   If they don't do it before then, the Gates will remain open and the 
   unimaginable will happen to all people on Earth. Evil will reign and 
   good will no longer exist.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It is at this time a series of graphic deaths happen. A necking 
   young couple in a car, Rosie (Daniela Doria) and Tommy (future 
   director Michele Soavi; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Stage Fright">STAGEFRIGHT</A></B> 
   - 1987; <B><A HREF="#Church1989">THE CHURCH</A></B> - 1989), see the 
   reanimated corpse of Father Thomas. Rosie begins begins bleeding at 
   her eyes and all her internal organs come pouring out of her mouth. 
   Tommy has his brains removed when Father Thomas rips the back of his 
   head open (the brains seeping through his fingers). It seems if 
   anyone sees a reanimated corpse, they are doomed to die a gory death. 
   Some of the townspeople blame Bob for the series of deaths, but 
   deep-down inside, they know it has something to do with their 
   ancestry. Little John-John Robbins (Luca Paisner) sees his dead 
   sister Emily (Antonella Interlenghi; <B><A HREF="yeti_1977.htm">YETI: 
   GIANT OF THE 20TH CENTURY</A></B> - 1977; who died earlier in the 
   film when she visited Bob and the corpse in the house tore out the 
   back of her head) staring at him through his bedroom window and 
   nearly scaring him to death. This is not the only dead body that has 
   come to life, as painter Sandra (Janet Agren; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EatenAlive1980">EATEN
    ALIVE!</A></B> - 1980) finds the dead body of an old woman in her 
   kitchen, who was buried earlier in the day. She calls her 
   psychiatrist, Gerry (Carlo De Mejo; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Contamination1980">CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   - 1980), to come to her studio to prove she is not insane and when he 
   gets there, the body has disappeared. Strange things happen in her 
   studio, like a window shattering by itself, the shards of glass 
   embedding themselves into a wall, which begins to bleed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then things start to get really nasty. When Mr. Ross (Venantino 
   Venantini; <B><A HREF="cannibal_ferox_1981.htm">CANNIBAL FEROX</A></B> 
   - 1981) catches Bob with his daughter (Bob was only trying to find 
   somewhere to sleep), he forces Bob to meet his death at the mercy of 
   a spinning bit of a table drill (this is the scene that this film is 
   best remembered for, as the drillbit enters Bob's head on the left 
   side and exits out the right side). Peter and Mary meet Gerry and 
   Sandra at Gerry's office, where they are attacked by millions of 
   (real) maggots. Gerry then gets a phone call from John-John, who 
   tells him that Emily has killed his parents. After picking up 
   John-John, Gerry, Peter and Mary (Sandra is left to look after 
   John-John at her studio) discover that all the bodies at the local 
   funeral home are missing from their coffins. They must find Father 
   Thomas' tomb and remove him from his casket before All Saints' Day, 
   which is only a couple of hours away. Sandra has the back of her head 
   torn off by the rotting corpse of Emily and John-John runs away to 
   the cemetery that our trio is at. He is saved by Gerry, who can't 
   believe his eyes when he sees Emily staring back at him. Our trio 
   discover Father Thomas' family tomb, but are they too late? It is now 
   All Saints' Day.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The patrons of Junie's Lounge are attacked, killed and eaten by a 
   decaying Bob and the living dead. Peter is killed by a decaying 
   Sandra, who rips the back of his head off, his brains pouring out of 
   the wound. Gerry and Mary are nearly killed by Father Thomas and the 
   dead occupants of the family rise from their graves, when they 
   surround the pair (Mary begins bleeding from her eyes). Gerry grabs a 
   wooden crucifix from one of the graves and impales the corpse of 
   Father Thomas through his stomach (it leaves a big hole), causing all 
   of the other living dead to catch fire and die. In the film's most 
   WTF moment, John-John (who is now in the custody of the police) spots 
   the pair and goes running towards them. We hear Mary say, &quot;No! 
   No!&quot; and then scream, while the camera freezes on John-John's 
   face and an optical effect shows the film shattering into pieces.

    The extras on the Blu-Ray fail to address the ending, but they are 
   informative nonetheless. We find out that Lucio Fulci was not fond of 
   actors and was basically a dictator on set. It is rumored that he 
   took great joy in seeing his actors suffer after being pelted with 
   live maggots and Christopher George, who had many arguments with 
   Fulci, filled up Fulci's tobacco pouch with maggots (Fulci always 
   brought his tobacco pouch and pipe on set). He also made Daniela 
   Doria put freshly-slaughtered sheep guts in her mouth (!) for the 
   film's internal organ puking scene. No one interviewed had good 
   memories about Fulci, but there is no doubt in anyone's mind that he 
   was able to turn out good, if not excellent, scenes of gore (even 
   though the actors really suffered for their craft and it shows 
   on-screen). Another extra on the disc is Italian special makeup 
   expert Gino De Rossi (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BurialGround1980">BURIAL
    GROUND</A></B> - 1980) explaining how he achieved all the practical 
   effects, including showing us actual props from the film. Besides 
   denigrating all American productions, De Rossi is as eerie as most of 
   his creations, as his left eye seems to be permanently crossed and 
   looking at his nose. The camera films him on his right side, but when 
   he turns his head, you get a creepy feeling. The screenplay, by Fulci 
   and Dardano Sacchetti (<B><A HREF="#CutAndRun1985">CUT AND RUN</A></B> 
   - 1985), tries to explain what is going on, but the fact is that 
   there are too many holes in the plot to make it realistic (The 
   biggest being: Why wasn't Mary embalmed? Also, the timeline is 
   seriously screwed-up.).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   one is a little different, though. Instead of slow moving, rip 'em

   opens with our hero (Hugo Stiglitz; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Night 1000 Cats">NIGHT
    OF A THOUSAND CATS</A></B> - 1972), a television reporter, covering 
   a story at a local airport. An unidentified plane lands and, while 
   police surround it, the door opens and a horde of well armed zombies 
   dash out. Arms are ripped out of sockets, throats are slashed, flesh 
   is eaten, and bodies are riddled with bullets. Hugo decides to warn 
   the populace, but to no avail, as he has the plug pulled on him by 
   government officials. Meanwhile, the zombies attack a televised dance 
   show (a girl's breast is cut off), a hospital (robbing a blood bank, 
   attacking bed-ridden patients, and stopping an operation in progress 
   to chow down on a patient's open incision), and at the end, an 
   amusement park (scenes of zombies being shot in the head in slow 
   motion). It all turns out to be a dream, however, when Hugo awakens 
   and remembers he has to cover a story at the local airport. Holy deja 
   vu Batman! It's a fun movie in a twisted sort of way. Forget the bad 
   dubbing and sit back and enjoy the gore. Directed by Umberto Lenzi (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST

    THE LEGEND OF SASQUATCH</A><A NAME="ClawedLegendSasquat"></A> (2005) -</B> 
   When four poachers are attacked on Echo Mountain by an angry 
   Sasquatch, only Ed Janzer (Miles O'Keeffe) makes it out alive. The 
   other three are mutilated (one is disemboweled), so Sheriff Drake 
   Kassel (Jack Conley) wants to form a hunting party to kill the bear 
   he thinks is responsible, but Mayor Potts (John Patrick Lowrie) and 
   the townspeople rather have the killings covered-up since tourist 
   season is near. Classmates Richard Winslow (Dylan Purcell) and Jay 
   Kelter (Brandon Henschel), who don't particularly like each other, 
   are both failing Biology class, so their teacher assigns them to work 
   together on a weekend project about endangered species. They head to 
   Echo Mountain with girlfriends Jenny (Chelsea Hobbs) and Shea (Casey 
   LaBox) to videotape some woodland creatures the same time Janzer 
   brings three more buddies to the mountain to hunt and kill the Indian 
   he thinks is responsible for the poachers' deaths. Richard is nearly 
   attacked by a grizzly bear, but quick thinking on his part (he 
   freezes in his tracks) saves his life. Park Ranger (and Native 
   American) John Eagleheart (Nathaniel Arcand) warns the kids to leave 
   the mountain (he calls the Sasquatch a &quot;noble savage&quot;), but 
   they get lost and discover the body of a dead Sasquatch. A live one 
   chases them, forcing the<A HREF="clawed_the_legend_of_sasquatch_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/clawed the legend of sasquatch dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>m
    to split up (Did we have any doubts this was going to happen?). When 
   one of Janzer's hunting party is killed by the Sasquatch, Janzer 
   captures Eagleheart and ties him up, cuts his chest with a knife and 
   uses him as bait (Can Sasquatch sniff out Indian blood?). Eagleheart 
   escapes just as the Sasquatch attacks Janzer's camp, killing Tom

   shoots and injures Eagleheart, but Richard grabs a rifle and kills 
   Janzer. Sasquatch roars with approval as Jay shows up with his video 
   camera to take footage of the creature. Richard and Jay then use the 
   footage to get their snotty biology teacher fired when he submits the 
   footage to TV and is branded a fraud. Those crazy kids!&nbsp; This 
   pretty ordinary DTV feature, directed and co-scripted by Karl Kozak (<B><A HREF="out_of_the_black_2001.htm">OUT
    OF THE BLACK</A></B> - 2001), manages to tie the white man's hatred 
   of Native Americans and the Sasquatch legend together and it doesn't 
   quite gel. The backstory as to why the Sasquatch is so mad at 
   humankind is this: During the Gold Rush in the mid-1800's, the white 
   man mined the mountains dry, forcing the Sasquatch off of their land. 
   They killed the miners in retribution and the white man blamed the 
   Native Americans for the killings, which resulted in the tribe being 
   wiped out to near extinction. Ed Janzer still carries that hatred of 
   Native Americans to this day, even when a Park Ranger of Indian 
   ancestry saves his life (Janzer refuses to believe that anyone or 
   anything other than Eagleheart is responsible for his friends' 
   deaths). While that plot device may be somewhat unique, it doesn't 
   make this a good film, as most of it is full of false scares 
   (including an out-of-place nightmare sequence that serves no other 
   purpose than to make you jump), teenage sexual hijinks (including 
   nudity, video voyeurism and wisecracks) and Sasquatch POV shots 
   (apparently they can only see in black and white). The nadir comes 
   when one member of Janzer's second hunting party farts into a 
   campfire. The film also uses elements of <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE
    BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</A></B> (1999) with some of the videotape 
   sequences and the gore is rather sparse after the opening minutes 
   (most of the later bloodshed is either shown through the Sasquatch's 
   eyes or in flashback scenes, both in black and white). The Sasquatch 
   costume is very good, but is used sparingly. Miles O'Keeffe (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#PhantomRaiders">PHANTOM

   his left arm useless. Five years pass and Jason has become a bitter, 
   obsessive man, who thinks of nothing but killing the bear who mauled 
   him and made his marriage to Chris (Carla Layton) dissolve. The 
   grizzly, who the press and locals have named the &quot;Devil 
   Bear&quot;, has been killing campers and townspeople for the past 
   five years and is smart enough to elude capture. When Howard (Glenn 
   Sipes), Chris's new boyfriend, takes a bunch of Boy Scouts, which 
   includes Chris and Jason's son Bucky, on an overnight camping trip, 
   the Devil Bear attacks, mortally wounding Bucky and seriously 
   wounding Howard and several kids. The news of Bucky's condition puts 
   Jason over the edge, especially when Chris visits him and begs him 
   not to go after the grizzly. Jason ignores her pleas and goes on the 
   hunt, but the woods are full of hunters looking to do the same thing, 
   as well as a scientific team that shows up to capture the rogue 
   grizzly alive. All these extra people in the woods proves beneficial 
   to the Devil Bear, as it goes on a killing spree, first slaughtering 
   the science team and their tracker, Marshal (Bill Ratcliffe), by 
   crashing through their cabin and tossing them around like ragdolls. 
   Jason, with the help of Indian Henry Chico (Anthony Caruso; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Zebra Force">ZEBRA
    FORCE</A></B> - 1976), who believes the bear is a supernatural 
   entity, begins tracking the Devil Bear, with forest ranger Ben Jones 
   (Leon Ames) and Howard tagging along. After a short while, the 
   hunters become the hunted, as the Devil Bear kills Henry (who was 
   having visions of wolves and three Indian spirits), then Harry and 
   gives Ben a heart attack, which forces Jason to call in a helicopter 
   and haul Ben away. When Chris gets the good news that Bucky is going 
   to recover from his wounds, she takes the helicopter out to the woods 
   to join Jason in killing the grizzly, by dousing it in gasoline, 
   shooting it with a magnesium flare and tossing it's flaming body over 
   a cliff. I hope you like your bear meat well-done.&nbsp; This regional<A HREF="claws_1977b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/claws 1977 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="252" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   horror film, co-directed by Richard Bansbach (whose only other film 
   credit is as producer/cinematographer of the ultra-cheap slasher film <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Bits And Pieces">BITS
    AND PIECES</A></B> [1985]) and Robert E. Pierson (his only film 
   credit), has it's effective moments, but is mostly a talky drama 
   about family relationships (told in endless flashbacks) and Indian 
   mysticism. The script, by Brian Russell and producer Chuck D. Keen (<B><A HREF="timber_tramps_1975.htm">TIMBER
    TRAMPS</A></B> - 1975), seems to be more interested in the soap 
   opera lives of the characters (angry husband; the ex-wife that still 
   loves him; drunk old Indian friend; etc.) and the bear attacks are 
   merely a way to connect the dots. The bear attack scenes are a 
   combination of stock nature grizzly footage, a man in a bear suit and 
   slow-motion POV footage from the bear's perspective. This is fairly 
   bloody for a PG-rated film, but most of the blood is viewed after the 
   bear attacks. There is no gore (except for an early shot of a bullet 
   entering the bear's body), but lots of blood is splashed on the 
   bodies of the bear's victims. The story behind the distribution of 
   this film is more interesting than the film itself. It was 
   re-released to certain territories in 1978 under the title of <B>GRIZZLY
    2</B>, which made some people think it was an official sequel to <B>GRIZZLY</B>.
    CBS-TV then aired this film once on it's 11:30PM program <B>THE LATE SHOW</B> 
   in 1981 under the <B><A HREF="claws_1977.htm">CLAWS</A></B> title. 
   When the official <B>GRIZZLY</B> sequel, <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Grizzly 2">GRIZZLY
    2: THE PREDATOR</A></B> (1983) was made (but never finished or 
   released), many people confused <B><A HREF="claws_1977c.htm">CLAWS</A></B> 
   with the official sequel and a legend was born, where many people 
   (even today) swear they saw the unreleased sequel on TV, when they 
   are actually remembering watching <B>CLAWS</B>. This legend has led 
   to many heated debates (Look up <B><A HREF="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093119/">GRIZZLY
    2</A></B><A HREF="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093119/"> on IMDB</A> 
   to get a taste of the legend), but as I have actually viewed the 
   unfinished workprint for <B>GRIZZLY 2</B> (see <A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Grizzly 2">review</A>)
    and can say with certainty that it was never completed, the TV rumor 
   is nothing but childhood memories getting their wires crossed 
   (something called &quot;The Mandela Effect&quot;). <B>CLAWS</B> 
   (which was also released on VHS in some foreign territories under the 
   title <B><A HREF="claws_1977d.htm">GRIZZLY</A></B>, just to make

    parishoners' confessions and murders those he considers too 
   permissive. When Jenny Welch (Susan Penhaligon) goes to confession 
   and tells Father Meldrum that she has had an abortion, he decides 
   that all those involved should be punished. He throws a pot of hot 
   coffee in the face of Jenny's friend Bobby (John Yule), who he 
   mistakes for Jenny's boyfriend, beats and burns Jenny's boyfriend 
   Terry (Stuart Bevan) with a flaming incense burner and buries him in 
   the church cemetery. He hopes Jenny will come to him and ask him to 
   help her. We slowly learn that the good Father has a sickly mother 
   (Hilda Barry) that he loves very dearly but is being abused by 
   one-eyed caretaker Miss Brabazon (played eerily by Walker regular 
   Shelia Keith), whose reasons for abusing her will be revealed later 
   on. Jenny's sister Vanessa (Stephanie Beacham) and border Father 
   Cutler (Norman Eshley) learn of the recording from Jenny and try to 
   get it back. When Father Cutler confronts Father Meldrum about the 
   tape, Meldrum plays another tape that makes Jenny look like she is 
   lying. Father Cutler doesn't buy it and digs for more clues, 
   including why a grave in the church cemetery which should be empty 
   has a mound of dirt that goes above ground level. Father Meldrum goes 
   to the hospital and kills Bobby so he cannot point the finger at him. 
   Jenny catches him in the act, but no one will believe her. A priest a 
   killer? Pish, posh! Vanessa and Father Cutler become lovers. How do 
   you think Father Meldrum will handle that situation? Mrs. Davey 
   (Julia McCarthy) tells Jenny that she knows that Father Meldrum is a 
   killer and offers to help her but is killed during Communion when the 
   Father gives her poison wine and a wafer. Things come to a boil in 
   the finale, a strange concoction that only Walker and McGillivray

   after she interviews Lt. Aris, she has the entire ship put in a deep 
   freeze and takes one of the eggs for examination, where she is told 
   by scientists that it is not an egg at all, but rather an 
   &quot;intensive culture of unknown bacteria&quot; that reacts to heat 
   and becomes deadly (We watch as a white rat is injected with the 
   green goo and then explodes). Stella believes that whomever was to 
   receive the cargo planned to put the &quot;eggs&quot; in the New York 
   sewer system, so she, Agent Young (Carlo De Mejo; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TerrorExpress1979">TERROR

   ship's cargo was to be delivered, only to discover that the warehouse 
   already contains thousands of eggs and then watch in horror as three 
   Latino men purposely expose themselves to the eggs and explode, 
   rather than be taken alive. After destroying all the eggs with 
   flame-throwers and learning back at the lab that the eggs are 
   actually alien in origin, Stella puts two-and-two together and 
   deduces that these eggs came to Earth from the last Mars expedition 
   two years earlier. She interviews that expedition's commander, Albert 
   Hubbard (Ian McCulloch; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   - 1979; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DoctorButcher1980">ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST</A></B> 
   - 1980), who was kicked out of the space program and deemed 
   &quot;psychotic&quot; when he reported that the Mars' polar icecap 
   was littered with eggs. He agrees to help Stella (who was 
   instrumental in getting him shit-canned from the space program) when 
   he discovers that his partner on that mission, Hamilton (Siegfried 
   Rauch; <B><A HREF="college_girl_murders_1967.htm">THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS</A></B> 
   - 1967), is responsible for cultivating the eggs. But for what 
   purpose? Stella, Hubbard and Lt. Aris fly to South America to find 
   out what Hamilton is up to, but they only have 72 hours before 
   Washington intervenes in a very big way. The best place to start is 
   the coffee factory, but Hamilton is aware of their presence and has 
   some surprises in store for them, even before they get there.&nbsp; 
   This is one of those films that I absolutely hated the first time I 
   saw it nearly thirty years ago, but I have come to appreciate it a 
   lot more on repeated viewings. It's connection to <B>ALIEN</B> is 
   tenuous at best (even though it was released in theaters and on VHS 
   under the title <B><A HREF="alien_contamination_1980b.htm">ALIEN CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   to capitalize on the-then popularity of the Ridley Scott-directed 
   film) and there's a scene here that pre-dates <B><A HREF="aliens_1986.htm">ALIENS</A></B> 
   by six years: When Stella is locked in a hotel bathroom with an egg 
   that is about to explode (basically the same thing as Ripley being 
   trapped in a locked lab with a face-hugger) while Hubbard and Aris 
   argue outside over who is going to win her affection. <B><A HREF="contamination_1980b.htm">CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   would be much better described as an &quot;aliens invade Earth&quot; 
   scenario (screenplay by Cozzi [who uses his &quot;Lewis Coates&quot; 
   pseudonym here] and Erich Tomek) with scenes of extreme gore (lots of 
   exploding stomachs and chests, many of them lovingly filmed in slow-motion)
    and a big-assed cyclops alien in the blood-filled finale. The second 
   part of the film plays more like a James Bond-like thriller with <B><A HREF="invasion_of_the_body_snatchers_1956.htm">INVASION
    OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</A></B> undertones, as we watch the eggs being 
   cultivated in the coffee fields and discover that Hamilton is 
   actually an alien duplicate. The reveal of the cyclops alien in the 
   finale is a hoot, as one look at it and you're instantly hypnotized 
   and eaten whole, as poor Lt. Aris discovers. Not a great film, but a 
   fun one nonetheless. Also starring Gisela Hahn (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Zambo1972">ZAMBO,

   don't believe her story because of her troubled past and the fact 
   that Dr. Uraski has great reputation. The police warn her to stay

   becomes obsessed with bringing him to justice which just gets her 
   into more trouble with her friends (who eventually abandon her

   her trying to take her life. She eventually kidnaps the doctor and 
   chains him in her basement, torturing him by slicing his achilles

   with a pole, slits his throat with a sword (all while handcuffed to

   film runs barely 70 minutes (and 5 minutes of it are the end credits)

   has no idea how to pace a film and the screenplay by Geralyn

   situations and laugh-out-loud dialogue.&nbsp; The entire film was 
   shot on short ends and uses recycled music from at least four New

   independent horror flick (and probably Canada's first gore film) that 
   begins with an audio announcement from a guy with a thick Canadian 
   accent that tells us that the film we are &quot;aboot to see&quot; 
   may be upsetting to some viewers, therefore a &quot;Warning Buzzer 
   and a picture of a patron reacting to the scene (actually an old guy 
   covering his mouth with a handkerchief in disgust) will be shown 
   before every act of gory violence. It gets shown twice! When the film 
   starts, we are introduced to the workers of the Happy Halo Funeral 
   Home, where the owner drives around a graveyard in his hearse 
   gloating about how well his business is doing (in voiceover 
   narration). The scene is intercut with footage of his undertaker 
   fixing the body of a corpse that has just been mauled by a bear (or 
   so we are led to believe). We then switch over to watching two 
   couples jumping in a motorboat and going to an island to have a 
   picnic. One couple gets naked and goes at it, while the other couple 
   watch (the other guy tries to get in on the fun, but the girl pushes 
   him away!). Since this is Friday the <A HREF="corpse_eaters_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/corpse eaters ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>13th,
    the couples decide to have a party and spend the night in a 
   graveyard (One of the guys even has the nerve to say, &quot;People 
   are dying to get into this place!&quot;). It begins to rain, so they 
   find an open crypt, where they draw a circle on a coffin and chant, 
   &quot;Lucifer, Lucifer, Barrabus, Barrabus, Santanis, by Satanis, 
   come, come!&quot; When nothing happens, one of the guys turns a 
   crucifix hanging on the wall upside down and they repeat the chant. 
   Something happens this time. The dead rise from their graves and they 
   eat one of the women (cue Warning Buzzer!) and attack one of the men. 
   As the three remaining survivors drives away, the girl asks her 
   boyfriend what the should do about their female friend that they left 
   behind. He says to his girlfriend, &quot;Forget her!&quot; They drive 
   their seriously hurt friend to the hospital, but he dies on the 
   operating table. The girl has a nightmare where she bites a huge 
   chunk of flesh out of her boyfriend's neck (cue Warning Buzzer!) and 
   then stabs a nurse to death. It turns out that the body delivered to 
   the Happy Halo Funeral Home was actually the guy who died on the 
   operating table. He rises out of his coffin and, along with the other 
   zombies, begins chowing down on the corpses in the funeral home and 
   eat the eyes of the funeral home's owner. In the confusing finale, 
   the owner is then seen clad in a strait-jacket and locked in a padded 
   cell while he yells, &quot;I'm not insane!&quot; and he still has his 
   eyes! Huh?&nbsp; Even though this film is just a tad under one hour 
   in length, it still seems about two hours too long. The acting is 
   strictly amateur hour and the special effects, while gory, are 
   sub-par (One of the zombies uses a shovel to cut off the hand of the 
   girl they just attacked and killed before he eats it. What ever 
   happened to chewing it off?). Directors Donald R. Passmore and Klaus 
   Vetter (yeah, it took two guys to direct this and, needless to say, 
   they drifted into obscurity) spend way too much time on shots that 
   lead nowhere (close-ups on the funeral home owner's eyes; the two 
   couples frolicking in the water; shots that go on for way too long 
   and never seem to end) and not enough time on the horror elements. 
   The sad fact is that it takes over thirty minutes for the first gore 
   scene (and Warning Buzzer) and then there is only one other gore 
   scene after that. Not very good for a film that runs less than sixty 
   minutes. There are too many loose ends to mention and the finale 
   makes no sense. Producer/screenwriter Laurence Zazelenchuk (who also 
   handled the zombie makeups) owned The 69 Drive-In in Ontario, Canada 
   at the time and took $36,000 of his savings to finance this film (he 
   fired Donald R. Passmore after four days of shooting and replaced him 
   with Klaus Vetter). He screened this film at his drive-in for a 
   couple of years as part of double and triple bills until <A HREF="howard_mahler_newspaper_ad_mats.htm">Howard

   stagecoach. Suddenly, the stagecoach throws a wheel and Imre and 
   Marlene (who are secret lovers) go out to look for it (yeah, right). 
   Back at the stagecoach, the stagecoach driver gets kicked in the head 
   by a horse (both horses flee into the forest) and dies. When Imre and 
   Marlene get back (after some nookie), they hear the whole sordid 
   story about what has happened and decide to walk the trail and see if 
   the can spot any houses for help. What they find is the Dr. Kargos 
   Sanatorium and when they ring the doorbell, they are greeted by the 
   seemingly nice Dr. Wendell Marlowe (Paul Naschy; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Horror Rises Tomb">HORROR
    RISES FROM THE TOMB</A></B> - 1972; who also co-wrote the screenplay 
   using his real name &quot;Jacinto Molina&quot;), who invites them all 
   in, but advises them that the building is in very poor shape and 
   there is only one real bed available. Most of the girls find Dr. 
   Marlowe the man of their dreams, not realizing that he is actually 
   Count Dracula, who needs a virgin to give herself to him without 
   reservation and with pure love, so he can revive his daughter (the 
   skeleton in the coffin we have seen earlier). I think we know who 
   that girl is going to be, don't we? Meanwhile, that unnamed 
   deliverman (remember him?) is now a vampire and is walking around the 
   buiilding, turning Imre and a couple of the girls into vampires, 
   while Count Dracula plants bear traps around the grounds to catch 
   some unexpecting peasants, so he can feed on them (a plot device I 
   wish they used more in this film because it adds something new to the 
   vampire mythos). Now all the women, except for Karen, are now 
   vampires and everyone tries to sink their fangs into her virginal 
   tasty flesh. When Imre tries to put the bite on her, Count Dracula 
   and Imre get into a fight and the good Count throws Imre out a 
   window, only to have him impaled on the iron gate below (something 
   you never saw in the TV version). When the unnamed deliveryman tries 
   to sink his fangs into Karen, Count Dracula impales him with a 
   fireplace poker. It seems that the Count and Karen have really fallen 
   for each other, so much so, in fact, that the Count can no longer go 
   through with the ceremony to revive his daughter (at one point in the 
   film he runs a dagger clear through Karen's neck while she is in a 
   trance and she feels nothing, but we can all feel her pain for her 
   because it is a great effect). Instead, Count Dracula pulls out a 
   wooden stake and impales himself through the heart, proving that love 
   is more powerful than family. The Dracula Curse will have to wait 
   another hundred years for it to take place again. The first thing you 
   will notice in this version is how much nudity and violence you 
   missed if all you have ever seen is the TV version of the film. The 
   movie is practically filled to the brim with female nudity and the 
   violence, although infrequent, is effective when it is used. It is 
   mainly throats slashed and bitten, various impalements, the 
   aforementioned ax to the head and an innocent village woman whipped 
   to a pulp as part of the discontinued ceremony (in other words, she 
   died for nothing!) Director Javier Aguirre is better known for 
   directing comedies and musicals, but he did direct two of the best 
   horror/giallo films in 70's Spanish history: the demented <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hunchback Morgue">HUNCHBACK

   (1973; also featuring Naschy). The photography and scenery are lush, 
   the girls are all lookers and they all get at least topless (in the 
   Spanish version, they were all clothed, because the Franco Regime 
   didn't allow nudity in movies) and the violence bloody and creative. 
   And absolutely no humor. My one only regret is that they didn't use 
   the bear trap gag for more kills (it is only used for one). This is 
   the first time I have seen that device used to capture vampire 
   victims. So if all you remember are the bloodless TV versions of this 
   film, I would advise you search out this double feature DVD, since it

   flash-forwards of Johnny being interviewed by a female DJ on a radio 
   show called &quot;Dead Air&quot; (this will become clear at the end 
   of the film). The theme park is sold to a major corporation and its 
   representative, Joe Stanberg (Armen Dirtadian), tells everyone that 
   it will be turned into an amusement park, complete with a 
   rollercoaster and a Halloween-themed attraction called &quot;Ghost 
   Town&quot;. The corporation has also reopened the abandoned Lost 
   Dutchman's Mine, turning it into an amusement ride. Joe tells 
   everyone that they still have jobs, but all Western shows have been 
   canceled, with Johnny now fighting the the evil &quot;Mr. Hyde&quot; 
   and his rampaging &quot;mental patients&quot;. Johnny doesn't care 
   for the news, but a job is a job and he still gets to use his 
   six-shooter. He becomes jealous when Joe hires Gloria to become Ghost 
   Town's evil, sexy temptress, in hopes of getting into her panties, 
   but Johnny will have a whole lot more to worry about than jealousy. 
   Things start to turn creepy when the restraints of an ancient vessel 
   in the Lost Dutchman's Mine is cut (on purpose) by Joe Stanberg, 
   unleashing a centuries-old dormant evil, which possesses both 
   Johnny's friend Gil (Juan Heinrich) and Gloria, turning them into 
   vampires. At first, no one but Johnny seems to notice a change in 
   Gloria, thinking she is just getting deep into her new evil temptress 
   role. Then everyone is introduced to the corporation's gaunt, pale 
   owner, Mr. Lowenstein (Norman Stone; he looks like he just stepped 
   out of <B><A HREF="salems_lot_1979.htm">SALEM'S LOT</A></B>), who 
   doesn't speak one word and seems to move by floating inches above the 
   ground. We are now certain that there has always been something 
   nefarious behind this corporation's takeover of the theme park, but 
   it is never made clear to the viewer (which is maddening). Stiil, the 
   employees don't seem to notice that something strange is going on, 
   even as many of them are being turned into vampires and ghouls 
   one-by-one. Johnny even gets bitten by Gloria, but his religious 
   convictions stop him (for the time) from turning into a full-blown 
   vampire (Say what now?). Johnny makes himself some wooden bullets 
   taken from a crucifix hanging on his wall (Say what now?) and plans 
   on showing his new bosses a big surprise on opening day. But will the 
   unexpected appearance of his daughter and ex-wife on opening day 
   throw a monkey wrench into Johnny's plans? Or will Johnny turn into a 
   vampire and join the new corporation as a full-time employee?&nbsp; 
   It takes forever for this film to get to the horror elements, as 
   freshman director/screenwriter Douglas S. Myers (who hasn't made 
   anything since) makes this seem like a family-friendly film (no 
   swearing, nudity or violence) until Sarah calls Johnny a 
   &quot;fucker&quot; 40 minutes into the film. As a matter of fact, 
   there is very little blood until the film's final 20 minutes at the 
   opening of the new amusement park, when it becomes a non-stop gore 
   fest, as people have their throats graphically torn-out, bloody 
   deaths by pick-axe, heads twisted around, we see a boy with his leg 
   bone sticking out of his skin, other children have their heads bashed 
   into the mine's rock walls and other people are impaled on wood 
   shards. The film doesn't make much sense at all. It is just a 
   hodge-podge of ideas that don't gel together very well. When Johnny 
   shoots vampires and skull-faced ghouls with his wood bullets, they 
   evaporate in badly-rendered CGI. The only thing that some people may 
   object to before all the gore happens is the performance of the 
   park's manager, Jeff (Christopher Reid), which is nothing but a gay 
   stereotype, which will be offensive to gay people everywhere. 
   Beautiful panoramic photography aside, this film offers very little 
   for horror film fanatics besides the final twenty minutes, but you'll 
   have to get through 78 minutes of tedium before it happens. The 
   acting isn't as bad as it could have been (Christopher Reid aside) 
   and Shannon Whirry still looks beautiful, but the entire film looks 
   to have been made up as they went along and it doesn't add-up to 
   much, especially the WTF?!? ending with Johnny at the radio show, 
   after we just previously saw him badly burned at a hospital after 
   causing an explosion at the amusement park, destroying everything 
   (lots of stock footage of an actual fire and the aftermath of an 
   explosion). Look for a poster of <B><A HREF="high_plains_drifter_1973.htm">HIGH

   Jesus, I wanted to hate this film so badly since the storyline makes 
   old hats look like shiny new fedoras in a department store, but the 
   overall goofy tone, mixed in with some extreme gore won me over. The 
   basic plot is this: Thirty-three years ago, a young boy named 
   Jeremiah watches as his uber-religious widowed mother (a cameo by 
   Tracy Scoggins) is viciously raped by two vagrants (who manage to 
   rape her with their pants on!) and then has her throat cut. The 
   vagrants then turn their attention to Jeremiah and bash him on the 
   head and leave him for dead. Guess what? He's not. Cut to the 
   present, as we watch six young adults who take a trip every year 
   based on a suggestion by a different member of the group. This time, 
   group member Heidi (Daisy McCrackin, daughter of Phil McCrackin. Old 
   joke, moving on...) wants to take the group (which includes Mario 
   Lopez, Bentley Mitchum, Justine Priestley, Francesca Orsi and Jason 
   Oliver) on<A HREF="crack_in_the floor_2000b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/crack in the floor vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="281" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   a hiking trip in the woods and stay at an old abandoned cabin, which, 
   you guessed it, is now occupied in the basement by an adult Jeremiah 
   (who we never get a clear view of his face), who doesn't fancy 
   visitors. Now this is where the film gets weird and outright 
   hilarious. The six adventurers stop at a gas station/fried chicken 
   joint in the middle of nowhere run by the one-armed Floyd Fryed 
   (Rance Howard, who we can plainly see is hiding his &quot;missing 
   arm&quot; under his shirt!) and run into Tyler Trout (Gary Busey in a 
   wonderfully perverted five minute cameo), who wears a disheveled and 
   bloody light blue three-piece suit and carries an ax, but he's not 
   dangerous, just weird. He hands one of the girls a freshly severed 
   chicken wing and tells her, &quot;Take the chicken wing, it's soft, 
   and use it as a suppository. Leave it in for 10 minutes, it'll take 
   you out of your misery.&quot; He then turns to her boyfriend and 
   says, &quot;You know what's good about that suppository? When she 
   farts, it's gonna smell like southern fried chicken. You hold that in 
   your heart.&quot; The two kids run to the vehicle and tell Lopez to 
   step on the gas (they are all eating Floyd's chicken, which they 
   promptly spit out and throw out of the window of their SUV after the 
   two tell them about their run-in with Tyler). Floyd and Tyler have a 
   good laugh at the kids' expense and Tyler just blurts out about a 
   plane coming to pick him up and take him to Brazil (it's obvious the 
   guy is crazy). When Floyd asks if he can come too and they can both 
   play with monkeys (?!?), Tyler says, &quot;Play with monkeys. Put 
   bananas in hidden places.&quot; That is the last we see of Floyd and 
   Tyler, but you will never forget them once you see and hear them. 
   It's like the entire sequence was improvised and it works so well, 
   you will be on the floor laughing your ass off. Unfortunately, the 
   rest of the film is the same old, same old, as one of the girls is 
   about to announce that she is pregnant to her boyfriend, the group 
   smokes lots of weed, tell a short horror story about &quot;The Empty 
   Man&quot; (David McNaughton in a blink and you will miss it cameo) 
   around the fireplace and Jeremiah dishes-out some bloody vengeance. 
   The first one to be killed is the Sheriff (played by Bo Hopkins, who 
   else?), who is graphically stabbed with a pitchfork and impaled on a 
   wall of the shack when he gets a call to check out a disturbance in 
   the area. Then the group gets picked-off one-by-one; one has her head 
   twisted around 180&#176;, so that when she is laying down, the front 
   of her head is on the same side as her back and ass; another has his 
   throat cut, two are killed with impalements with a pickaxe, until 
   only Lopez is left. He is picked-up by Officer Gordon (Stephen Saux), 
   who arrests Lopez after he tells his story. When the Sheriff doesn't 
   return, Officer Gordon begins to believe Lopez's story and they head 
   out to the shack, where they are both chopped to pieces by Jeremiah 
   with an ax. No survivors. We next see Jeremiah in his basement 
   waiting for more victims to slaughter in a sequel, which this many 
   years later, never materialized. Co-directed by Corbin Timbrook (who 
   also directed the superior <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Ranch">BLOOD
    RANCH</A></B> - 2005; and starred in such films as <B><A HREF="killer_within_me_2003.htm">THE
    KILLER WITHIN ME</A></B> - 2003) and Sean Stanek (director of <B><A HREF="played_2006.htm">PLAYED</A></B> 
   - 2006), who really don't offer anything new to the horror genre 
   except for a sense of playfulness (not parody; I hate parody) missing 
   from most horror films. The cast of young adults talk to each other 
   like real people and don't bicker like you see in most horror films. 
   Stanek's screenplay (based on a story by Timbrook and himself) 
   doesn't offer much in the way of suspense, because the killing are 
   quick (except for Svenson's; his is protracted and hard to watch) and 
   all we really see of Jeremiah is his long stringy hair and his eyes, 
   but that just adds to the mystery of the man. It's the five minute 
   sequence with Rance Howard (as we all know is the father of Ron 
   Howard and Clint Howard) and Gary Busey that will stick in your head 
   long after the film is over, because it just comes out of left field 
   and really adds that extra &quot;oomph&quot; to the film. I can think 
   of a lot worse films to watch than <B><A HREF="crack_in_the floor_2000b.htm">A
    CRACK IN THE FLOOR</A></B> (and believe me, I have). It's a quick 90

   Two Chicago college guys, Pahoo (Dennis Fimple) and Rives (John David 
   Carson), go to the forest and swamps of Louisiana to look for the 
   title creature, a bigfoot-like monster said to inhabit the area. The 
   creature supposedly has never harmed a human being, but there's 
   always a first time, as we see the creature kill the partner of fur 
   trapper Joe (Jack Elam) by dragging him under a boat in the middle of 
   the swamp. Pahoo and Rives hit town and begin asking questions about 
   the creature and are almost immediately warned by the sheriff (Bill 
   Thurman) to stop inquiring about the creature (Everyone in town are 
   reluctant or afraid to talk about it). After a near disastrous 
   encounter with Joe in a diner, Pahoo and Rives meet Orville 
   (screenwriter Jim McCullough Jr.), who tells them a story about 
   seeing the creature when he was young and it causing an automobile 
   accident, which kills his mother and <A HREF="creature_from_black_lake_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/creature from black lake dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>father.
    Orville then takes them to see his grandfather (Dub Taylor), who 
   tells them more stories about running into the creature (it killed 
   his favorite hound). Grandpa treats the two &quot;Yankees&quot; like 
   his own, telling them funny stories and treating them to a home 
   cooked meal as long as they don't mention the creature in front of 
   his wife (who still can never forgive it for killing her daughter and 
   her husband). During dinner, Pahoo mistakenly mentions the creature 
   (he thinks the mule braying outside is the monster!) and Grandpa 
   throws them out of the house, but Orville allows them to stay in the 
   barn for the night. That night, the creature comes for a visit and 
   Rives records the creature's yell on his tape recorder. Later, Pahoo 
   and Rives meet two local girls (one of them happens to be the 
   sheriff's daughter) and it's not long before the girls visit their 
   campsite at night for some romantic fun. Unfortunately, the creature 
   comes for a visit followed by the sheriff, who throws them in jail 
   (Whoops! The girls were underage.). While in jail, Joe is attacked by 
   the creature and later arrested for being drunk. He is thrown in the 
   same cell as Pahoo and Rives, which leads to a series of events where 
   Joe tells them the location of the creature. Pahoo (who wants to go 
   home) and Rives (who wants to stay) camp out for one final night in 
   the woods. It all turns out badly, as a case of mistaken identity 
   leads one friend to accidentally gut-stab the other while the 
   creature is attacking them. This slow, leisurely-paced piece of hokum 
   doesn't have much to recommend except for the cast of great character 
   actors and an unexpected downbeat ending, which is totally out of 
   place from the rest of the film. Director Joy Houck Jr. who directed 
   the offbeat and bloody films <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Night Bloody Horror">NIGHT
    OF BLOODY HORROR</A></B> (1968) and <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NightOfTheStrangler">NIGHT

   there is no nudity, very little bad language and no blood at all, 
   except for the aforementioned finale, which is an eye-opener. 
   Probably made to cash-in on the spate of bigfoot documentaries at the

   television) and ends up breaking his heart. She not only turned-in

   films in her resume, which brought me to this British/German 
   co-production, a horror thriller set in the London subway system (or 
   &quot;Tube&quot; if you like). The film opens with two workers 
   clearing a drain clog in a sewer tunnel when they hear the most 
   god-awful scream. They go to investigate and find a new tunnel, which 
   the veteran worker, Arthur (Ken Campbell), <A HREF="creep_2004b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/creep 2004 british dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>declares
    he has never seen before. The new worker, George (Vas Blackwood), 
   stays behind while Arthur takes a closer look, but when Arthur 
   doesn't return, George has no other choice but to go look for him, 
   thinking this is nothing but a practical joke on the &quot;new 
   guy&quot;. He quickly learns that this is no joke, as he finds Arthur 
   in a state of shock, staring into the darkness. A bloody, screaming 
   woman suddenly leaps into view, only to be violently jerked-back into 
   the darkness. We then switch to a huge house party, where Guy (Jeremy 
   Sheffield; <B><A HREF="#Children2008">THE CHILDREN</A></B> - 2008) 
   unsuccessfully hits on Kate (a blonde Franka Potente) and he doesn't 
   seem too pleased about getting the brush-off. Kate leaves the party 
   to try and get George Clooney's autograph at a party across town, but 
   when she is unable to find a taxi, she has no choice but to take the 
   subway. With the last train of the night arriving in eight minutes, a 
   slightly tipsy Kate sits down on a subway station bench and falls 
   asleep. When she wakes up, she discovers that she has missed the last 
   train and is also locked in the station (of course we all know there 
   is no cell phone service down there), but when a mysterious subway 
   train arrives at the station, she hops aboard without hesitation 
   (alcohol is indeed a dangerous drug!), as does a mysterious shadowy 
   figure further down the station. When the train stops a few seconds 
   later, Kate goes to the engineer's car to find out what the problem 
   is (she can't see it, but the engineer has been brutally murdered), 
   only to discover that Guy is the only other passenger on the train, 
   he's tweaked on cocaine and he attempts to rape Kate. Before he can 
   do the deed, Guy is violently pulled off the train by forces unknown 
   and killed, but not before yelling to Kate to &quot;Run!&quot; She 
   does just that, exits the train and heads back to the station, but 
   she is still trapped like a rat until morning arrives. Someone or 
   something is after Kate, so she will do anything to survive. She 
   meets a variety of people, including Jimmy (Paul Rattray) and Mandy 
   (Kelly Scott), two homeless people who live in the bowels of the 
   station with their dog. Too bad for Kate that everyone she comes in 
   contact with ends up dead (the killer's appearance is always prefaced 
   by a groundswell of rats), so she makes her way through the tunnels 
   (with a dead Jimmy and Mandy's dog as a companion) until she ends up 
   in the same tunnel as the two unfortunate sewer workers in the 
   beginning of the film. What she discovers living there can best be 
   described as a cross between the films <B><A HREF="raw_meat_1974.htm">RAW

   only question is: Will Kate survive it all (I guess she can forget 
   about getting Clooney's autograph!)?&nbsp; I must admit that this 
   film, directed and written by Christopher Smith (<B><A HREF="severance_2006.htm">SEVERANCE</A></B> 
   - 2006; <B><A HREF="triangle_2009.htm">TRIANGLE</A></B> - 2009), 
   sucked me in and had my full undivided attention for the first two-thirds,
    even with the leaps in logic (No one who works for the subway 
   noticed the missing train that made an unscheduled stop?) and plot 
   contrivances (no cell phone service; a security guard more interested 
   in his own security than anyone else's), but when the final third 
   rolls around and we discover that the killer is an underground mutant 
   named Craig (Sean Harris) who kidnaps subway riders to cannibalize (A 
   flashback shows that Craig's father may have been an abortionist, so 
   Craig dons medical gear and gives Mandy, who is strapped to a gurney 
   with her legs spread wide-open, a makeshift abortion with a big-ass 
   bone saw), the film falls apart and turns into a standard 
   &quot;monster-on-the-loose&quot; horror flick. It does get points for 
   being extremely gory in the final third (both George and Craig's 
   deaths are memorable), but I was expecting so much more than what I 
   got based on the first sixty minutes. At least Franka Potente rises 
   above the material and doesn't offer us the usual helpless heroine 
   role. She's got balls here (Her reply to a homeless guy who asks her 
   for &quot;change&quot; as she pulls out money of an ATM early in the 
   film sets the tone of her character) and her final shot is sad and 
   funny at the same time. Music by The Insects. Also starring Sean 
   Harris, Kathryn Gilfeather and Grant Ibbs. Another great film that 
   takes place on the subway is the Canadian film <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EndOfTheLine2006">END

   a simple movie, and by &quot;simple&quot; I mean a movie so lacking 
   in even the basic tenants of entertainment, it would take a retarded

   opens with a flash-forward of things to come: Military men in obvious 
   model tanks trying to blow-up a giant spider on the loose in 
   Hollywood; eventually destroying the world-famous Hollywood Sign in 
   the process (The giant spider is a combination of bad CGI and a 
   stuffed toy spider, while all the sets are obvious models). The film 
   then switches to two days earlier at the top-secret Foothills <A HREF="creepies_2004b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/creepies poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="248" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Experimental
    Weapons Center, where two bumbling Privates accidentally set loose 
   an experimental killer spider and fail to tell anyone about it for 
   fear of being court-martialed (ah, wartime during the Bush 
   Administration!). The spider gets its revenge by killing the two 
   Privates (it eats its way into the back of one of them and spits its 
   venom into the eyes of the other), which, in turn, releases even more 
   genetically-enhanced spiders (also a mixture of grade school CGI and 
   hilariously bad animatronics) into the wild. Two hours after the 
   incident, the Foothills Experimental Weapons Center is nothing but a 
   giant spider web, so the military sends three men (!) to check it 
   out. After they discover a fissure in the ground and are killed by 
   the spiders (one guy has a spider attack his hand, so he blows his 
   own hand off with his pistol!), a toy helicopter lowers more military 
   man into the facility and the drop grenades into the fissure (when 
   one guy asks his Commanding Officer if civilians are in any of the 
   buildings, he replies, &quot;So we lose a couple of janitors. Big 
   fuckin' deal!&quot;). The next day, the military try to clean up the 
   mess as covertly as possible (by employing a platoon of toy tanks and 
   motorized rocket launchers!), but the story switches over to a female 
   rock band, The Barenaked Barbies, performing in a garage in Westwood. 
   The female rockers, Michelle (Lisa Jay), Brinke (Phoebe Dollar) and 
   Linnea (Calley Edmunds), along with Michelle's boyfriend, Dave (Jeff 
   Ryan), head out to a recording studio to cut a demo, the same studio 
   where the military accidentally shipped a box containing a bunch of 
   killer spiders (Holy Fucking Coincidence, Batman!). As you have 
   probably already guessed, some careless workers bust open the 
   container and release the spiders (the head spider rallies the troops 
   speaking Spiderese, which is subtitled in English!) just as the 
   Barenaked Barbies and Dave arrive. Meanwhile, the military have to 
   deal with a giant spider that is attacking Hollywood Boulevard and a 
   military officer, Major Graves (Garett Clancey), who cares less for 
   civilian lives than the giant spider does (He delivers a line about 
   the &quot;phonies&quot; in Hollywood that made me laugh out loud). 
   Sweet googly-moogly, how is all this going to turn out and who is 
   going to be left alive?&nbsp; Director Jeff Leroy (who also handled 
   the editing and cinematography chores, as well as the model effects) 
   tries to make this an Americanized version of the Godzilla films, but 
   the cut-rate model effects, along with the super-cheap CGI effects, 
   make any Godzilla or Japanese giant monster films look Spielbergian 
   in comparison. Screenwriter Eric Spudic's (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Aquanoids">AQUANOIDS</A></B> 
   - 2003; <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Killers By Nature">KILLERS
    BY NATURE</A></B> - 2005) joke-filled script (the female band 
   members are given the first names of 80's B-movie scream queens) is 
   the best thing about this film, especially the dialogue between 
   recording studio workers Steve (Joe De Angelis) and Jake (Eric 
   Flenner) and the sly in-jokes referencing <B><A HREF="return_of_the_living_dead_1986.htm">THE
    RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1985) and other genre films. 
   Although the visual and model effects are laughable (not to mention 
   sound effects that were cribbed from <B><A HREF="them_1954.htm">THEM!</A></B> 
   [1954]), play close attention to the signs on the buildings being 
   blown-up (One theater is showing &quot;Robert Ginty in <B><A HREF="exterminator_1980.htm">THE
    EXTERMINATOR</A></B>&quot; and the Hollywood Bowl has &quot;Eminem 
   In Concert&quot;). This is badly acted by everyone involved 
   (including a cameo by porn star Ron Jeremy as &quot;Officer 
   Spudic&quot;!), but is saved somewhat by Eric Spudic's acerbic humor 
   (the genetically-enhanced spiders have barcodes on their bellies and 
   Jake's Lynryd Skynyrd speech are two laugh-getters) and some very 
   bloody makeup effects (the spider attack scenes are quite gory, as is 
   Jake's shotgun death of Linnea). It's still retarded entertainment

   chores with producer David Sterling and Eric Spudic (who, by the 
   looks of it, had very little input in this story) and to put it 
   simply: He's no Eric Spudic. Since Hollywood and Los Angeles were 
   nuked at the end of the first film and everyone died, Part 2 picks up 
   immediately after Part 1, with a giant genetically-enhanced spider 
   (created with a combination of bad CGI and throwing a toy stuffed 
   spider against the miniature model sets) surviving the nuclear blast 
   and moving its hairy black ass to Las Vegas, where it causes all 
   types of new problems with a fresh cast and gets to wreck havoc on 
   model versions of Las Vegas landmarks. The film opens with two 
   soldiers checking out the charred remains of L.A. and discovering 
   that all of the fist-sized spiders are retreating en masse. The two 
   soldiers are almost killed by a giant spider, but General McGinty 
   (Robert Ambrose) enters the scene pilo<A HREF="creepies_2_las_vegas_attack_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/creepies 2 poster small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="235" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ting
    a giant robot called the Mecha-Destructor (I laughed because it 
   makes the robots in <B><A HREF="mighty_morphin_power_rangers_the_movie_1995.htm">MIGHTY
    MORPHIN POWER RANGERS</A></B> look high-tech in comparison and it 
   walks like it has got a load of shit in its metal diaper!) and blasts 
   the spider to kingdom come. The film then switches to Las Vegas and 
   we are given a quick visual tour of the Strip, while a man with a 
   briefcase containing vials of genetically-altered spiders is being 
   chased by someone in a car. As is to be expected, the vials break and 
   the man is eaten by the spiders, who then make their way into a 
   casino. Two government operatives call General McGinty to inform them 
   that the spiders have now spread to Las Vegas. You know what that 
   means: Very soon, toy tanks, plasma cannons, jets on visible strings 
   and the Mecha-Destructor will soon be in the gambling capital of the 
   world, laying waste to most of the well-known casinos and landmarks. 
   The spiders couldn't have come at a worst time, because the final 
   three players in the Texas Hold 'Em championship, Robert (genre 
   director Jeff Burr [<B><A HREF="leatherface_the_texas_chainsaw_massacre_3_1990.htm">LEATHERFACE:

    OF THE SCARECROW</A></B> - 1995]), Burt (Jed Rowen) and an Elvis 
   impersonator named Doug Jacobs (Mitch Toles), are playing each other 
   to determine who is Vegas' best card player. The Mecha-Destructor 
   flies from its base in Area 51 and heads to Vegas, while General 
   McGinty leads the ground forces and Brooke (Gina Valona) leads the 
   jet assault. Rudd (Warren McCullough), one of the co-pilots of the 
   Mecha-Destructor, tries to warn his girlfriend Kristin (Star Hansen), 
   who just happens to work at the spider-infected casino (What are the 
   odds?), about the impending spider doom, but she doesn't believe him 
   (after all, he's only the co-pilot of the giant robot, it's not like 
   he's the pilot!). Meanwhile, the spiders begin their attack, first 
   killing a naked hooker and her john in one of the casino's hotel 
   rooms. The hooker gives birth to a giant spider, who escapes through 
   an open window (Anyone who has ever been to a Vegas casino hotel 
   knows that the windows don't open to prevent suicide jumps) and 
   begins terrorizing the Strip. The jets are the first to arrive on the 
   scene and begin blowing-up Las Vegas, without the slightest 
   consideration for civilian life (In one funny explosion, you can see 
   obvious Barbie and Ken dolls flying though the air with their clothes 
   on fire!). If you have seen the first film, you know what to expect 
   here: Wanton destruction of Vegas landmarks (including bad model 
   versions of The Golden Nugget, Treasure Island, Excaliber, Mandalay 
   Bay, The BeLuxor Hotel, etc.) with a secondary story about innocent 
   civilians on the ground trying to survive not only the spider 
   attacks, but also the explosions from an uncaring 
   military.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the explosions are bigger and the 
   destruction grander, <B>CREEPIES II</B> is sorely lacking in the 
   humor and genre film references, something the first film had in 
   spades, thanks to Eric Spudic's screenplay. While Spudic (a truly 
   nice and talented guy who should get more recognition than he does) 
   is credited as a co-screenwriter here, it's quite obvious that 
   director Jeff Leroy was more interested in making an old-fashioned Japanese-inspired
    giant monster flick (rumor has it that the Japanese loved the first 
   film so much, they funded this one) than a semi-comedic horror film, 
   which is what made the original <B><A HREF="#Creepies2004">CREEPIES</A></B> 
   such a retarded joy to watch. Still, if you want to see a model

   all done on a budget that would make Andy Milligan wince (and he's

   There's not much to recommend about this film, directed by the

   and distortion only found on VHS tapes. The dubbing is atrocious, the

   uncontrollable laughter and more people filling the seats than the

   (basically an even cheaper remake of <B><A HREF="blood_feast_1963.htm">BLOOD
    FEAST</A></B> - 1963), I became somewhat facinated by what director 
   Jack Weis had created and had to know what else he had made. This was 
   before home computers and the Internet, so I had to do a lot of leg 
   work. I found out that he had directed just one other film, the 
   nearly impossible to find (back then anyway) <B><A HREF="crypt_dark_secrets3.htm">CRYPT
    OF DARK SECRETS</A></B>. I was hoping that it was as insane and 
   jaw-dropping as <B>MARDI GRAS</B>. I am sad to report that it is not. 
   Although made before <B>MARDI GRAS</B>, this film is much more 
   polished and professional for such a cheap flick. Sure, the 
   exploitation elements are here: Damballa (Maureen Ridley), a 
   beautiful witch who turns into a snake, brings Viet Nam vet Ted 
   Watkins (Ronald Tanet) back to life after he is robbed and killed by 
   a trio of thieves on his &quot;haunted island&quot; in the Louisiana 
   bayou. She then exacts revenge on the trio. That's basically it in a 
   nutshell. Compared to <B>MARDI GRAS</B>, <B>CRYPT</B>is a lame and 
   bloodless affair. Gone is the unrated gore that <B>MARDI GRAS</B> 
   wallowed in. In fact, <B>CRYPT</B> is rated R solely due to the fact 
   that Ms. Ridley spends a good amount of her screen time totally 
   naked. The violence is so tame that Ted dies after being hit over the 
   head with a rolling pin (!) and then falls into the bayou. It's as if 
   director Jack Weis was hit over the head after making this film and 
   turned into someone totally different. The two films do contain some 
   similarities. Both contain bad acting and dime store special effects. 
   But gone is the kinetic awfulness that made <B>MARDI GRAS</B> such a 
   facinating train wreck. <B><A HREF="crypt_of_dark_secrets_1976.htm">CRYPT

    The film opens with a young Tilda exiting a horse-drawn carriage, 
   not knowing how she got there and very frightened. She sees a dark, 
   almost invisible figure get out of the carriage and she screams. The 
   screen goes black for a moment and we then see Tilda dead on the 
   ground, a look of fright on her face, as the dark figure gets back 
   into the carriage, noticing the letter &quot;K&quot; embroidered on 
   the figure's cape. &quot;That same night, many miles away, in the 
   ancient castle of the Counts of Karnstein&quot;...Laura Karnstein 
   (&quot;Audry Amber&quot;; actually Adriana Ambesi; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FangsLivingDead1969">FANGS
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1969) wakes up screaming after having a 
   bad nightmare (?), telling housekeeper Rowena (Nela Conjiu) that her 
   cousin Tilda has been killed. Rowena asks a sobbing Laura if she 
   thinks it was just a bad dream and she says no, she saw something 
   &quot;black&quot; kill her cousin, she is sure of it. It was like she 
   was there.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, a young man knocks on the castle's door and tells 
   Cedric the Butler (Jose Villasante; <B><A HREF="shoot_first_ask_questions_later_1975.htm">SHOOT
    FIRST...ASK QUESTIONS LATER</A></B> - 1975) that his name is 
   Friedrich Klauss (Jose Campos) and Cedric says that the Count has 
   been expecting him for quite some time. Cedric takes him to Count 
   Ludwig Karnstein (Christopher Lee; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HorrorCastle1963">HORROR
    CASTLE</A></B> - 1963). The Count informs Friedrich that what he 
   wants him to do is a matter of life and death. He wants Friedrich to 
   reconstruct the life of an ancestor of his called &quot;Cira of 
   Karnstein&quot;, who lived 200 years ago. Legend has it that Cira was 
   accused of being a witch and of murdering young girls. She was 
   crucified and every trace of her life was wiped out to &quot;exorcize 
   the evil.&quot; The Count wants Friedrich to come up with an image of 
   Cira, using the documents and books in the castle's rather large 
   library. He doesn't tell Friedrich why he wants the image, only 
   telling him, &quot;Let us call it idle curiosity.&quot; When the 
   Count goes to show Friedrich to the library, Annette (Vera Valmont) 
   tells the Count she needs to talk to him immediately, so he has 
   Cedric show Friedrich to the library. Annette informs the Count that 
   his daughter Laura had another one of her dreams last night, but she 
   feels it is good that Friedrich has come to the castle and the Count 
   agrees with her. What are this pair up to? Friedrich starts to go 
   through the books in the library, looking for any mention of Cira he 
   can find, but a rolled-up manuscript catches his eye. When he unrolls 
   it, he discovers a large hole in it shaped like a five-pointed star. 
   We then see Rowena holding the parchment star and telling Laura, 
   &quot;Everything is ready down in the crypt. We'll know the truth 
   tonight, once and for all.&quot; Laura tells Rowena that she is 
   frightened and Rowena says, &quot;Many things tend to frighten us, 
   because we don't understand them.&quot; What are this pair up to?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It turns out that Laura has the gift of second sight, only she 
   doesn't want it because all it shows her is death and destruction. 
   The Count tells Laura and Rowena that they will have a special guest 
   for dinner and Laura's eyes light up because it's not often that the 
   castle gets visitors. Over dinner, Laura tells Friedrich that living 
   in the castle is like &quot;living in a tomb or somewhere at the very 
   edge of the world&quot;, but Friedrich says he loves living in the 
   past, especially in castles, because his job as a researcher puts him 
   in the past. Friedrich hears a bell ringing in the distance and 
   inquires where it is coming from, as he did not see a village near 
   the castle. Annette tells him it is coming &quot;from the village of 
   Carlstone, it's all ruins now, except for a tower where the wind 
   sometimes sets the bell ringing.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Friedrich begins reconstructing Cira's life and discovers she cursed 
   all the Karnsteins and all those who bear the name Karnstein in the 
   future. &quot;Though centuries go by, my day of vengeance will 
   come!&quot;, says Cira. She then goes on to say, &quot;I, Cira of 
   Karnstein, swear this on the star with five points!&quot; We then see 
   Rowena and Laura in the crypt, Laura topless and lying on the crypt 
   floor on her stomach, her body positioned in the shape of a 
   five-pointed star. Rowena holds the parchment star and calls for 
   Cira's spirit to appear and inhabit Laura's body and then she burns 
   the star. A flashback then occurs, showing the Count's ancestor 
   condemning Cira for her sacrilegious crimes that shame the Karnstein 
   name. Cira, who is crucified topless to a cross (her back is to us, 
   so we see nothing naughty, not even her face), curses the Karnstein 
   name, telling the ancestor she is being unjustly punished, saying, 
   &quot;One day a Karnstein will appear among you, bearing not only my 
   face, but my burning lust for vengeance! Then for every hour of my 
   torment, one of the house of Karnstein will pay with his life!&quot; 
   Back in the present, we see Laura yelling out, &quot;Murderers! 
   Murderers!&quot; Laura then comes to her senses and sees that her 
   wrists are bleeding, like they were tied. Rowena tells Laura that she 
   was possessed by Cira, but only for a minute. Why is Rowena lying to 
   Laura? We then discover the real reason why the Count brought 
   Friedrich to the castle. He hopes the image of Cira he produces bears 
   no likeness to his daughter, which brings up the question: What will 
   the Count do if Cira does look like his daughter? Annette tells the 
   Count not to worry and then asks him why he doesn't marry her, she 
   would love to have the Karnstein name, if only to have a large letter 
   &quot;K&quot; embroidered on her robe!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's not long before Friedrich and Laura become romantically 
   involved, but just as their romance is beginning to bloom, they save 
   a young woman named Lyuba (Ursula Davis; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Kong Island">KING
    OF KONG ISLAND</A></B> - 1968) from almost being run over by her 
   mother's (Carla Caylo, as &quot;Cicely Cayton&quot;; <B><A HREF="flower_in_his_mouth_1975.htm">THE
    FLOWER IN HIS MOUTH</A></B> - 1975) errant carriage. Laura convinces 
   the mother to let Lyuba stay with her until her mother returns from a 
   long trip and they soon become best friends, postponing her and 
   Friedrich's romance. Friedrich catches Annette searching through the 
   manuscripts and books and she tells him if he wants to reconstruct 
   Cira's image, all he has to do is look at Laura. It seems that 
   Annette doesn't love the Count at all, she wants him to suffer, but 
   why? (She's a real bitch with a capital &quot;C&quot;. Rowena tells 
   Friedrich that Annette is nothing but a parasite, like the vines that 
   curl around the trees and gradually strangle them.) Friedrich finds a 
   manuscript with two levels of writing on it and when he removes the 
   top level, he finds an important clue, saying that a portrait of Cira 
   actually exists and it is hanging on the castle wall. Right after 
   Cira's death, someone painted her portrait over, but the manuscript 
   fails to mention which painting it is (the castle has over a hundred 
   paintings hanging on its walls). Friedrich asks the Count if he wants 
   him to scrape all the paintings in the castle until he finds the 
   right one and the Count says no, why destroy paintings for something 
   which may no longer exist?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Laura begins laughing for the first time in quite a while whenever 
   she is with Lyuba. Friedrich tells Laura he would like to spend time 
   with her so she isn't alone, but she tells him she's not alone, she 
   now has Lyuba. The Count is happy to see his daughter now smiling, 
   telling Annette that Lyuba is good for Laura, but wet blanket Annette 
   says she doesn't trust Lyuba. One night Laura gets out of her bed and 
   walks in a trance into Lyuba's bedroom. When Laura wakes up, she 
   discovers her pillow is soaked in blood and senses Lyuba is in 
   danger. She tells her father that she killed Lyuba because she has 
   become a monster who should be put to death. When the Count and 
   Friedrich go to Lyuba's bedroom, they find her unconscious, two small 
   puncture wounds on her neck. Is it possible that Laura is now a 
   vampire? Friedrich tells the Count he knows the real<A HREF="crypt_of_the_vampire_1964.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/terror in the crypt italy poster12 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   reason he is here because Annette told him. Now is the time to ask 
   ourselves this: Which woman in the castle actually resembles Cira? Is 
   it Laura? How about Lyuba? Or could it be Annette? I'm giving long 
   odds on Rowena, because anything is possible. If you want to know the 
   answer, I'm afraid you are going to have to watch the film. Is it 
   possible that a hunchback peddler (Angel Midlin) knows the answer? 
   (It's hard to point out who the person is when someone cuts off your 
   hands! One of his hands is used as a candle holder by Rowena!)</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This black and white Gothic horror film, directed by Camillo 
   Mastrocinque (<B><A HREF="angel_for_satan_1966.htm">AN ANGEL FOR SATAN</A></B> 
   - 1966), who is listed as &quot;Thomas Miller&quot; in the credits, 
   is full of atmospheric sequences that use shadows to good effect, a 
   staple in many of the best Gothic horror flicks. The screenplay is by 
   &quot;Robert Bohr&quot; (actually Tonino Valerii; director of the 
   excellent Spaghetti Western <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#PriceOfPower1969">THE
    PRICE OF POWER</A></B> - 1969) and &quot;Julian Breen&quot; 
   (actually Ernesto Gastaldi; director of the excellent Gothic giallo <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Libido1965">LIBIDO</A></B>

    LONG HAIR OF DEATH</A></B> (1964), which many people (including 
   myself) believe is one of the best Gothic horror films of all time. 
   It's easy to see that Valerii and Gastaldi used this film as a 
   blueprint for <B><A HREF="long_hair_of_death_1964.htm">HAIR</A></B>, 
   as it contains many of the same elements, as well as a good mystery 
   to go along with it. Christopher Lee excels as a man who cares deeply 
   for his daughter, so much so, he breaks down in front of Friedrich 
   when he realizes Annette has deceived him (the look on the Count's 
   face when Friedrich peels away the top layer of the painting, 
   revealing Cira's likeness, tells us more than ten pages of dialogue). 
   Only Lee could give us that kind of emotion without speaking a single 
   word. If you want to see an early-'60s horror film done right, look 
   no further than this one.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (Katherine McCall), while trying to get over the death of her father, 
   buys a crystal from Mr. Beazel's Antique Shop to forget about her 
   troubles. It turns out that Mr. Beazel (Tony C. Burton) is good ol'

   a private game where a group of teens, led by the beautiful Dodger 
   (Lindy Booth), try to guess who the wolf is in the group by the rest 
   of the students (called &quot;the sheep&quot;). The one who guesses 
   correctly gets a pot of money. Bored with the game and hearing about 
   a local girl killed in the woods by an unknown assailant, the kids 
   decide to send a fake email to all the students telling a false story 
   that a serial killer called The Wolf is loose and killing students in 
   the school. Mr. Walker (a zoned-out Jon Bon Jovi), a teacher who

   one who sent out the email and to keep his nose clean. Pretty soon, 
   real murders of the cast of the game begin to happen, as The Wolf

   threatening instant messages (supplied by AOL, who gets a prominent 
   mention in the final credits and movie ad mats), planting weapons in 
   his backpack, chasing him down empty school corridors, and killing 
   off his mates one-by-one according to Owen's original email. Did I 
   mention that all this takes place during Halloween? Well, things turn 
   out to be not what they seem as we witness the lamest ending to a 
   horror film in quite some time. If you can't spot who &quot;the 
   killer&quot; is, you either have the IQ of a rock or didn't pay 
   attention to the first 10 minutes. I'm not going to give the ending 
   away. You'll have to suffer just like I did. This film, originally 
   rated PG-13 for its' theatrical release and Unrated for its' DVD 
   release (a couple of seconds of gore was put back in), is so goddamn 
   awful on many levels, including a cameo by Gary Cole as Owen's 
   uncaring father. He sports the worst English accent I think I have 
   ever heard in a film. I was laughing hysterically every time he 
   opened his mouth and I'm a big fan of Cole (who was so good as the

   so well while American actors can't do the opposite? If there is one 
   good thing I can say about the DVD is that director Jeff Wadlow 
   included his award-winning short film, <B>THE TOWER OF BABBLE</B>, a 
   smart and deeply affecting 20 minute exercise about the English 
   language, where three different stories interconnect in the use of 
   the same phrases, whose interpretation is used differently in each 
   story as all three stories come crashing (literally) together in the 
   finale. It's a smart, inventive short (only available on the Unrated

   (1987) -</B> Leave to those thieving pirates at VideoAsia/Ventura 
   Distribution. They stole the Ocean Shores print of the Hong Kong 
   horror film called <B>CURSE</B> (it still has the Ocean Shores bug 
   burned on the print at various times), retitled it <B>CANNIBAL CURSE</B> 
   on the DVD sleeve (but not on the print itself) and put it on store

   Cantonese language tracks simultaneously and the subtitles are so low 
   on the screen that they are unreadable. Here's what I was able to 
   make out: A young woman named Miss Chan is in love with a young man 
   named Roberto, but her family disapproves (he is only the gardener, 
   after all). Tired of being abused by her wheelchair-bound father and 
   nearly raped by her own brother (!), <A HREF="tales_of_terror_vol_4_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/tales of voodoo volume 4 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Miss
    Chan agrees to run away with Roberto but, before she is able to, he 
   is savagely run over and killed by a car driven by her brother. Miss 
   Chan goes to a female witch doctor and has Roberto's soul transferred 
   into another man's body. Here's the catch: She doesn't know who's 
   body the soul has been transferred in. The witch doctor only tells 
   her that she will know who it is when she meets him. Forty years pass 
   and a reincarnated Miss Chan is still searching for her Roberto. She 
   goes to a fortune teller, who says she should travel to Manila. She 
   does and she meets Robert, who she immediately recognizes as her 
   reincarnated lover. The only problem is that Robert is married and 
   has a baby. Robert recognizes her too, but hasn't got a clue why. A 
   fortune teller spikes his drink and, after that, every woman he meets 
   looks like Miss Chan. This is when the film gets really weird. 
   There's an evil sorcerer who rapes women, worships snakes and has a 
   band of pygmies who do his bidding. Miss Chan goes to him for a love 
   spell she wants to put on Robert. Since Miss Chan is still a virgin, 
   the sorcerer can't touch her, but he warns her that when she loses 
   her virginity, she will have to do him a favor. She agrees, takes the 
   potion and puts it in Robert's drink. He instantly falls in love with 
   her and he pops Miss Chan's cherry. Things come to a boil when 
   Robert's wife, Amy, comes to Manila looking for him and the evil 
   sorcerer has now called in his favor (It involves snakes. Lots and 
   lots of snakes). Amy hires a good sorcerer to find her husband. In 
   the finale, the good and evil sorcerers duke it out for Robert and 
   Miss Chan's souls.&nbsp; Watching a Hong Kong film without readable 
   subtitles is like trying to read braille with no fingertips. It's 
   downright impossible. There's always something visually crazy going 
   on, but without the subtitles to rely on, how you decipher it is a 
   crapshoot. There's pygmies with vampire teeth (then without), black 
   panthers, close-ups of lizard eyes, bats, snakes and plenty of 
   topless women (ass cracks aren't allowed, though, as they are 
   optically fogged out). Robert becomes sick and he begins growing 
   scales on his stomach. When the evil sorcerer tries to fuck Miss 
   Chan, her vagina snaps off his pecker and snakes burst out of his 
   body. Snakes seem to be a recurring theme in Hong Kong horror films. 
   There's plenty of nudity and gross scenes (mostly involving those 
   damn snakes) to keep you occupied even if you can't read 80% of the 
   subtitles. Ocean Shores should sue. Directed by Kong Yeung. Starring 
   Maria Jo, Elisa Ye, Isabel Lopez and Susan Brandy. A

    run over a bunch of snakes in the middle of the road. When Clark 
   goes out to investigate, he is bitten by a snake when they stop at a 
   gas station to get their vehicle fixed by a stubborn gas station 
   attendant (Al Fann), who keeps a mutated dog chained up in the 
   basement of his garage. Seems the area has been the subject of 
   radiation tests and the animals (mainly the snakes) have mutated and 
   are extremely poisonous. Clark gets an anti-venom shot by traveling 
   salesman (and part-time unlicensed doctor) Harry Morton (Jamie Farr, 
   who plays his role with a Jewish accent, but is quite funny!), 
   thinking that Clark was bitten by a normal poisonous snake known to 
   the area. After a closer study, Harry realizes that Clark was bitten 
   by a mutated snake and spends the rest of the film trying to locate 
   Clark (by using a CB radio to contact truckers, including a plump 
   female one named &quot;Big Flo&quot; [Marianne Muellerleile], who is 
   also Harry's lover!) so he can give him the right inoculation (and 
   not be sued for malpractice!). Clark and Lisa run into a local 
   sheriff (played by Bo Svenson in his usual overwrought style, with an 
   unexplained bandage on his nose), and thinking that Clark is high on 
   drugs, arrests them both and sends Clark to the hospital for 
   detoxification. Clark's behavior begins to change and the trip to the 
   hospital to treat his hand turns rather nasty. It seems his hand is 
   turning into a snake (!) and the snake-hand kills a nurse before 
   Clark escapes after Harry faints before he is able to administer the 
   shot. The finale shows Clark turning into a giant mutated snake who 
   is about to devour Lisa in a muddy pit before Harry blows off it's 
   head with a shotgun. Director Fred Goodwin (actually Italian director 
   Federico Prosperi [writer of his brother's Franco's crazy film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wild Beasts">WILD
    BEASTS</A></B> - 1983]) uses the New Mexico desert locations in the 
   beginning of the film to good effect as snakes are run over in slow 
   motion (a very good scene) and the locale does imbue an eerie hue on 
   the film. Unfortunately, once Svenson appears on the scene and the 
   location shifts to a city, the film suffers a lack of focus. The film 
   resembles <B><A HREF="sssssss_1973.htm">SSSSSSS</A></B> (1973) to a 
   certain extent, but is much more graphic. Released in both <B>R-Rated</B> 
   and <B>Unrated</B> editions. The differences are Fann's attack (and 
   death) by his mutant dog is more graphic, the death of the nurse (who 
   has her lower jaw ripped off) is completely missing and Clark's 
   transformation at the end is more elaborate (the scene with snakes 
   coming out of his mouth will make some people lose their lunch) along 
   with other bits of gore in the Unrated edition (including a policeman 
   having his heart removed through his mouth and the death of an 
   uber-religious family who take Clark in when the father notices him 
   hiding from the police in his pickup truck; effects expertly done by 
   Screaming Mad George). This film is good for a little fun, but only

   (or did he?). The rest of the film depicts Elizabeth's struggle to 
   remain alive as supernatural things begin to happen which may have 
   something to do with the good doctor's hidden agenda. While not 
   overly bloody (head decapitation of actor Henry Cele 
   notwithstanding), one-time director Sean Barton (who works as a film 
   editor to this day) fills the screen with dread and suspense, as 
   Elizabeth must fend for herself and try to fight off the curse. The

   and it is an unremarkable religious possession tale marred by a 
   relentlessly slow pace. It also contains a couple of scenes that will 
   make devout Catholics see red. The picture opens during the times of 
   the Inquisition as we witness a priest exorcising, then walling up, 
   an albino demon (Jeremy West) in an Italian monastery's sub-basement. 
   The demon stays confined up until the present day, where he escapes 
   to terrorize and possess the population of the monastery, including a 
   visiting schoolteacher (Laura Scheafer) and a priest who may be 
   losing his faith (Timothy Van Patten). It's pretty slow going and 
   rather bloodless. It does show some promise during two scenes even if 
   the Pope and his followers will tend to disagree. The first scene is 
   a touching dialogue spoken by a dying elderly priest regretting why 
   he never had sex with a girl named Dolores when he was sixteen years

   I decided after watching director Dennis Devine's feature debut, the 
   horribly awful <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FatalImages1988">FATAL IMAGES</A></B> 
   (1988), to see if he's improved in the proceeding 18 years. Here's my 
   verdict: No! A thousand times no! <B>CURSE OF PIRATE DEATH</B> is a 
   lame-ass, low-rent SOV feature (made to cash in on <B><A HREF="pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl_2003.htm">THE
    PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN</A></B> craze) that contains the same awful 
   acting, bad sound and cheap gore effects that Devine's first flick 
   contained, only this time there's bad artifacting any time the camera 
   sweeps left-to-right or up-and-down, making it look like your 
   watching it through venetian blinds. Here's the story in a nutshell 
   (and believe me, it could fit there): Over two hundred years ago, the 
   dreaded Pirate Death (Mitch Toles, who also supplied the crappy 
   makeup effects) buried his treasure in a place called (what else?) 
   Pirate's Point and slaughtered everyone who witnessed the burial. In 
   the present day, lesbian college professor Anna Blackhart (Sally 
   Mullins) lectures her students on how they are all decendants of the 
   victims of Pirate Death (How can that be, if Pirate Death slaughtered 
   all of the witnesses? It's just one in a long line of &quot;How can 
   that be's&quot; in this turkey.) and sends them searching for the 
   treasure, unaware that a decaying Pirate Death roams the area killing 
   anyone who gets near his booty. That's basically the plot <A HREF="curse_of_pirate_death_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/curse of pirate death dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="251" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>of
    the whole film, as Professor Blackhart has lesbian encounters with 
   some of her students, bitchy student Amber (Syn DeVil) manages to 
   piss-off everyone she comes in contact with and another female 
   student has visions of the pirate massacre two centuries earlier, 
   which will lead her and her friends to the treasure and the wrath of 
   Pirate Death. They find the treasure near a &quot;white brick 
   wall&quot; (it's repeatedly mentioned, but it's really a white 
   cinderblock wall) and they each take a gold dubloon. Faster than you 
   can say &quot;<B><A HREF="leprechaun_1992.htm">LEPRECHAUN</A></B>&quot;,
    Pirate Death begins killing them off one-by-one until he gets 
   tricked into turning mortal, in which he is then run-through and 
   decapitated with his own sword. Oh Fate, why are you so cruel?&nbsp; 
   I thought that <B>FATAL IMAGES</B> was a horrible experience, but 
   nothing prepared me for the crappy brain-frying banality that is <B>CURSE
    OF PIRATE DEATH</B>. Not only is the acting no better than the level 
   of a high school play, but we also get to see veteran actor Vernon 
   Wells (<B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">THE ROAD WARRIOR</A></B> -

   flashback scenes (Wells is also listed as one of the Associate 
   Producers in the credits, just like he was in the far-superior <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Ranch">BLOOD
    RANCH</A></B> [2005], but we all know what it takes to become an 
   Associate Producer, right? Absolutely nothing!). The Hedgehog 
   himself, Ron Jeremy, also puts in a cameo appearance as Professor 
   Jackson, who wanders around a field making sexual remarks to students 
   and fondling Professor Blackhart's breasts. It's apparent all his 
   scenes were probably shot in a timespan of an hour and when he 
   remarks in the film, &quot;Oh, God, this day sucks!&quot;, I wanted 
   to scream out, &quot;Amen, brother!&quot; Co-star Syn DeVil walks 
   around with her emormously fake-looking silicone-enhanced breasts 
   exposed throughout the film (how anyone finds these plastic hooters 
   even remotely attractive is beyond me). When she smiles, all I see is 
   way too much gum and not enough teeth. The gore effects are also 
   sub-par, as Pirate Death runs people through with his sword (so we 
   can watch close-up of the actors spitting out blood), slices off 
   arms, slits throats or pokes out eyes with his hook hand (yes, he has 
   a hook hand). The funniest scene (not &quot;ha-ha&quot; funny, just 
   &quot;pathetic&quot; funny) comes when the dastardly pirate shoves 
   his hand through the back of the head of some poor girl until it 
   comes out of her mouth. It's all done in one take and is so laughable 
   and obvious, I did chuckle out loud. I doubt this was the reaction

   headache-inducing Death Metal tracks from bands like North Side 
   Kings, Hush and Meat Rocket. Producer David Sterling has been

   (complete with rifles with exploding bullets) and run into the 
   reanimated corpses of a Confederate outfit hungry for the taste of 
   Nothern flesh. When one of the men finds a chest with an old 
   Confederate diary in it, he steals it and the dead rise looking to 
   get it back. That's the whole film, folks. The majority of the 
   running time is spent on long boring stretches of people walking 
   through the woods, bad actors screaming their lines at each other and 
   zombies in bad makeup walking drunkenly through the woods (their 
   faces are either covered-up in cheap latex masks or greasepaint, but 
   their hands are normal). By the look of the hairstlyes and clothing 
   on view, this film (originally titled <B><A HREF="curse_of_the_screaming_dead_1982.htm">CURSE
    OF THE SCREAMING DEAD</A></B>) looks to have been filmed at least 
   five years prior to the end credits production date of 1982. Either 
   that or Maryland (where this film was lensed) doesn't have a dress 
   code. Director Tony Malanowski ups the gore quotient from his 
   previous film (which had zero gore), but it is so amateurish (dig 
   those exploding head effects!) and comes so late into the film, 
   you'll probably be asleep or turned it off long before you get to it. 
   The night scenes are so dark that it's hard to make out what's going 
   on and, since a good 50% of the film takes place at night, that can't 
   be a good thing (or could it?). Wait until you hear the line where 
   one of the guys tries to rationalize how it is easier for the blind 
   girl to travel at night than in the day time! And pay close attention 
   to the scene where the cop is talking on his two-way radio in his 
   patrol car. It's a comedy classic of bad timing in the making. I also 
   love the way the zombies manage to pull out pieces of flesh from an 
   untorn shirt. There are so many laughable moments (including a toy 
   car on fire), that one could view this as an unintentional comedy if 
   it weren't so damned boring. This is strictly amateur hour stuff. 
   I've passed gas that has had more personality than this film. Death 
   row inmates should ask to watch this film as their last request 
   because it is the longest 88 minutes they will ever sit through.

    19th Century Europe: We watch Waldemar Daninsky (Naschy again) 
   hunting a wolf, which has been killing his livestock. He has the wolf 
   in the sights of his shotgun and pulls the trigger. When he goes to 
   check on the body, he is horrified to see that he has shot a man, 
   part of a clan of gypsies who are passing through the territory. 
   Waldemar feels terrible about it and cannot be consoled, even by his 
   housekeeper Malitza (Ana Farra; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_walking_dead_1975.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE WALKING DEAD</A></B> - 1975). Waldemar doesn't know he had 
   actually shot a werewolf, who was the son of the head of the gypsies, 
   an evil old witch (Elsa Zabala; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TragicCeremony1972">TRAGIC
    CEREMONY</A></B> - 1972). She performs a blood ritual with the skull 
   of a wolf and sends gypsy member Ilona (Ines Morales; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FeastOfSatan">THE
    FEAST OF SATAN</A></B> - 1971) to get romantically involved with 
   Waldemar and then curse him with lycanthropy (The first time we see 
   Ilona, she is totally naked, giving us a full-frontal eyeful!). At 
   the same time, local constable Roulka (Vidal Molina; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DragonflyEachCorpse">A
    DRAGONFLY FOR EACH CORPSE</A></B> - 1973) comes to Waldemar's castle 
   to warn him that a dangerous man has escaped from a mental asylum and 
   is believed to be in the area. Things start to get interesting after 
   that bit of news. While Waldemar is on horseback, he sees Ilona 
   passed-out on the road (she is faking) and brings her back to his 
   castle. They soon become lovers, but his valet, Maurice (Fernando S. 
   Polack; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Apartment13thFl72">APARTMENT ON THE 
   13TH FLOOR</A></B> - 1972) and Malitza don't trust her (always listen 
   to your hired help). During a full moon, Ilona performs a ritual 
   where she slits her wrist and lets her blood drip on the wolf skull. 
   She then takes the skull and has it bite a sleeping Waldemar on his 
   chest. She then runs into the forest, where she is killed by the 
   crazy escaped mental patient (I bet that wasn't in her plans!). 
   Waldemar doesn't know it, but when five full moons pass, he will 
   become a werewolf. Waldemar begins having nightmares every night 
   where he is being hunted down by the villagers (a portend of things 
   to come?). One day, Waldemar saves the beautiful Kinga (Fabiola 
   Falc&oacute;n) from falling down the side of a cliff. Kinga is one of 
   two daughters of Professor Laszlo Wilowa (Eduardo Calvo; <B><A HREF="vengeance_of_the_mummy_1975.htm">VENGEANCE
    OF THE MUMMY</A></B> - 1973), an engineer from Budapest who has come 
   to get mineral rights to some caves in the area. Waldemar and Kinga 
   become lovers (he is one lucky man!), while the escaped maniac 
   continues killing villagers in the forest. Five full moons pass and 
   we see a werewolf kill a young girl who is feeding livestock. Roulka 
   believes the maniac killed her, but the villagers believe it was the 
   work of a werewolf. The maniac tries to kill Kinga, but Waldemar 
   saves her, seriously wounding the maniac by planting a dagger in the 
   his torso. As the maniac escapes, Waldemar is surprised to discover 
   that it wasn't Kinga he was saving, but her equally beautiful sister, 
   Maria (Maritza Olivares; <B><A HREF="border_cop_1979.htm">BORDER COP</A></B> 
   - 1979), who was pretending to be Kinga. Maria also wants Waldemar 
   and she tells him she won't leave until he takes her virginity (I 
   mean, how lucky can this man get???). Waldemar pops her cherry, but 
   he turns into a werewolf mid-coitus and kills her. Maurice and 
   Malitza cover-up the murder, making it look like the work of the 
   escaped maniac, but Kinga's blind mother, Irina (Pilar Vela), knows a 
   werewolf is on the loose, but can't get anyone (including Laszlo) to 
   believe her. She tells Kinga that only a &quot;dagger of silver&quot; 
   can free her from the grip of the Devil (Waldemar), but Kinga doesn't 
   believe that Waldemar is a werewolf. Always listen to your mama 
   because she knows what she is talking about.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The werewolf Waldemar kills three villagers (he bends their shotgun 
   like Superman!), so the leader of the village, Bela (Jose M. Martin; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CountDraculasLove">COUNT
    DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE</A></B> - 1972), performs a ritual where he 
   removes the eyes from the dead villagers (!) and throws them into a 
   fire. This brings up the ire of Roulka, who doesn't believe in 
   werewolves because they don't exist and he threatens to jail the 
   villagers for desecrating the bodies of the dead villagers. The hairy 
   Waldemar then kills Laszlo and viciously murders a young couple in 
   their home, but the stubborn Roulka still refuses to believe it was 
   the work of a werewolf and thinks the killings were caused by the 
   escaped maniac or a bear(!). Irina has Kinga fashion a silver dagger 
   by melting some of her jewelry because it will come in handy later 
   on. When the decomposing body of the escaped maniac is found (he died 
   shortly after Waldemar stabbed him), Roulka begins to come around, 
   but not soon enough, as the villagers kill Maurice (run-through with 
   a scythe) and begin to storm Waldemar's castle. The shouldn't have 
   picked a night with a full moon to do it because the furry Waldemar 
   is waiting in the forest for them. Waldemar crushes Roulka's head in 
   with a boulder, kills Irina and then confronts Kinga in the forest, 
   where she ends Waldemar's life with the silver dagger (he doesn't 
   fight it, he accepts death). An epilogue shows us that Kinga had a 
   son with Waldemar and, just like his father, he, too, is a werewolf. 
   Countess Bathory's curse is still strong.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is by far the most subdued of Naschy's werewolf films. Some 
   would say too subdued for its own good and I wouldn't disagree, but 
   this film is more of a romance than a full-blown horror film. Sure, 
   there is some graphic violence (the aftermath of Roulka's 
   head-crushing is particularly memorable) and some great nudity, but 
   director Carlos Aured (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Horror Rises Tomb">HORROR

    third of the film and the nudity occupies the first third of the 
   film. That's not to say this is a boring film, because it's not, but 
   fans of this franchise will probably be disappointed when compared to 
   Naschy's other werewolf films. The most notable difference here is 
   the lack of dialogue, as some scenes are played without words, 
   especially during the opening 15 minutes (the film is only 84 minutes 
   long in its most complete version). The werewolf transformations are 
   old school, a series of dissolves, much in the same way as Lon Chaney 
   Jr.'s (an idol of Naschy) <B><A HREF="wolf_man_1941.htm">THE WOLF MAN</A></B>

   Goldstone Film Enterprises under the review title with Anglicized 
   credits (Fabiola Falc&oacute;n = &quot;Faye Falcon&quot;; Maritza 
   Olivares = &quot;May Oliver&quot;; Carlos Aured = &quot;Charles 
   Aured&quot;, etc.), with a fullscreen VHS from Dark Dreams Video in 
   the mid-'80s and a budget VHS from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Budget Labels">Gemstone
    Entertainment</A> in the early-'90s, both using the edited, 
   77-minute print. The DVD, from Anchor Bay Entertainment (my review is 
   based on this DVD), is the most complete version and the widescreen 
   print looks fantastic. The extras on the disc includes a trailer for 
   the film, a Naschy poster and stills gallery, a Naschy biography and 
   a 15-minute 2000 interview with Naschy (he passed away in 2009). 
   Naschy treats his films with the respect they deserve (unlike people 
   such as George Eastman, who puts down the films he appeared in as 
   trash), saying the films are no longer his, as they belong to the 
   fans (of which I am one!). He also tells us how and why he came up 
   with his well-known pseudonym and why he chose the name &quot;Waldemar
    Daninsky&quot; for his werewolf character (Back then in Spain, you 
   couldn't have a killer with a Spanish name and expect it to play in 
   Spanish theaters, so he made his character Polish!). A nice little 
   package that is quickly going OOP. Speaking of OOP, Deimos 
   Entertainment/BCI also put this film out as part of a double feature 
   DVD, with Naschy's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF
    SHADOW</A></B> (1970), as part of their Paul Naschy series, but it 
   is harder to find than the Anchor Bay DVD (be aware that the film 
   runs two minutes shorter than Anchor Bay's version). No Blu-Ray 
   available at the time of this review, but that should change shortly. 
   The next film in the series is <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WerewolfAndTheYeti">THE
    WEREWOLF AND THE YETI</A></B> (1975). Also starring Santiago Rivero (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Scarab1982">SCARAB</A></B>

   (1982) -</B> Early 80's slasher film that never get the respect it 
   deserved, probably because of its troubled production history (It 
   started filming in 1980, but two years of reshoots caused the 
   director, Richard Ciupka, to take the pseudonym &quot;Jonathan 
   Stryker&quot;, which just happens to be the name of the main 
   character in this film, giving the whole viewing experience a 
   &quot;film-within-a-film&quot; feel). In the film, conceited and 
   abusive film director Jonathan Stryker (John Vernon; <B><A HREF="chained_heat_1983.htm">CHAINED
    HEAT</A></B> - 1983) has to shelve his latest film, <B>AUDRA</B>, 
   when leading lady Samantha Sherwood (Samantha Eggar; <B><A HREF="brood_1979.htm">THE
    BROOD</A></B> - 1979) suffers a mental breakdown (she tries to stab 
   Jonathan with a letter opener in the doctor's office) and is led away 
   in a straitjacket. It all turns out to be a grand performance by 
   Samantha, since the title role of Audra is a madwoman and Samantha 
   gets herself committed, all in the name of &quot;research&quot;. 
   Jonathan is <A HREF="curtains_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/curtains poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>in
    on the ruse, but Dr. Pendleton (Calvin Butler) thinks Samantha is 
   actually insane. The more time Samantha spends in the loony bin with 
   all the female crazies (the screamers, the laughers and even serial 
   ticklers!), the more Samantha seems to go actually mad, so much so 
   that Jonathan decides to keep Samantha in the institution and hold an 
   audition at his mansion with six actresses battling for the role of 
   Audra. What Jonathan doesn't count on is Samantha escaping from the 
   asylum (with the help of some unseen female accomplice) and she vows 
   to get the role back by any means possible. I guess you know what 
   that means: The other actresses auditioning for the role, diva Brooke 
   Parsons (Linda Thorson; <B><A HREF="half_past_dead_2002.htm">HALF 
   PAST DEAD</A></B> - 2002); ballet dancer Laurian Summers (Anne 
   Ditchburn); stand-up comedienne Patti O'Connor (Lynne Griffin; <B><A HREF="black_christmas_1974.htm">BLACK
    CHRISTMAS</A></B> - 1974); musician Tara Demillo (Sandra Warren; <B><A HREF="terror_train_1980.htm">TERROR
    TRAIN</A></B> - 1980); professional ice skater Christie Burns 
   (Lesleh Donaldson; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Funeral Home">FUNERAL HOME</A></B> 
   - 1980); and Amanda Teuther (Deborah Burgess), begin to meet unwanted 
   (and sometimes gory) demises. But is Samantha the one responsible? 
   Amanda (who likes to play elaborate rape fantasies with her 
   boyfriend, Peter [Booth Savage], when he breaks into her apartment 
   with a stocking over his head and assaults her on her bed while she 
   feigns disgust) never makes it to the audition, as she is viciously 
   stabbed in her own apartment by someone wearing an old hag mask (this 
   is after Amanda has a very vivid death dream about a creepy toy doll, 
   which makes an appearance at two other murders). The other five 
   actresses do make it to Jonathan's mansion, where he introduces them 
   to his assistant Matthew (Michael Wincott; <B><A HREF="metro_1997.htm">METRO</A></B> 
   - 1997) and Samantha shows up to tell Jonathan and the other 
   actresses that she is Audra and everyone else doesn't stand a chance. 
   Jonathan disagrees and it's not long before the other actresses begin 
   dying, but what is the connection with the creepy doll? Alas, because 
   of all the reshoots, we never get to find out.&nbsp; Although quite 
   disjointed in spots, especially the second half (thanks to the 
   reshooting, which included Linda Thorson replacing actress Celine 
   Lomez in the role of Brooke Parsons after Ms. Lomez shot most of her 
   scenes), <B>CURTAINS</B> has its share of atmospheric sequences and 
   shocking deaths. Director Richard Ciupka (<B><A HREF="dead_end_1999.htm">DEAD
    END</A></B> - 1999) and screenwriter Robert Guza Jr, (who wrote the 
   story to <B><A HREF="prom_night_1980.htm">PROM NIGHT</A></B> - 1980) 
   nearly have this film achieve classic status based solely on the 
   death of Christie Burns, who is ice-skating on a frozen pond to some 
   cheesy love ballad on her radio, when the music suddenly stops and 
   she finds the creepy doll buried in the snow. The killer, dressed all 
   in black (including ice skates!) and wearing the old hag mask, skates 
   behind Christie and attacks her with a scythe, chasing her into the 
   woods and eventually killing her (Brooke finds Christie's decapitated 
   head in her toilet later in the film!). If the rest of the film could 
   maintain this intensity and inventive camerawork, we might be 
   mentioning it in the same breath with <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
   (1978) and <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY THE 13TH</A></B> 
   (1980). As it stands, <B><A HREF="curtains_1983b.htm">CURTAINS</A></B> 
   is a well acted, if very fractured (especially the sudden 
   disappearance of Matthew and the non-sensical ending), slasher film 
   that delivers the creepy goods. It's not particularly bloody, but it 
   doesn't need to be. That fucking doll is still sending shivers down 
   my spine! Canadian staple Maury Chaykin (<B><A HREF="vindicator_1986.htm">THE

   an adult (and buff) Willie Aames, who tells Olsen that his real last

    The film then begins, as we watch Quecho (Michael Berryman; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#EvilWithin2016">THE
    EVIL WITHIN</A></B> - 2016) and a bunch of loincloth-wearing natives 
   raid an illicit cocaine ring on the banks of the Amazon River (filmed 
   in Venezuela). The natives kill all the men with poison-tipped 
   blowgun darts and rape the women. A plane lands on the river, piloted 
   by Colonel Brian Horne (the late Richard Lynch; <B><A HREF="premonition_1975.htm">THE
    PREMONITION</A></B> - 1975), a very bad man who set up the raid to 
   get the cocaine for himself (his real reasons are explained in the 
   screwed-up ending). Just before the opening credits roll, we watch 
   Quecho use his machete to cut the heads off the nude, raped women (A 
   scene missing from the R-Rated Theatrical version and the old VHS 
   tape, both released by New World Pictures).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    After the opening credits, we watch as investigative TV reporter 
   Fran Hudson (Lisa Blount; <B><A HREF="prince_of_darkness_1987.htm">PRINCE
    OF DARKNESS</A></B> - 1987) and cameraman Mark Ludman (Leonard Mann; <B><A HREF="night_school_1981.htm">NIGHT
    SCHOOL</A></B> - 1981) are doing a story on Columbian drug runners. 
   While the camera is rolling, they walk into the aftermath of one of 
   Quecho's raids. Fran finds a photo of Col. Horne in one of the dead 
   women's purse, so she goes to black pimp and informant (for a price) 
   Fargas (<B><A HREF="er_tv.htm">ER</A></B>'s Eriq La Salle, who 
   probably doesn't list this film on his resume) to get some background 
   information on Col. Horne. She learns that Col. Horne was 
   dishonorably discharged from the Vietnam War and has close ties to 
   the Reverend Jim Jones (of the Guyana Jonestown Massacre). What does 
   this have to do with the rest of the film? Absolutely nothing, except 
   for a throwaway line of dialogue in the finale.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fran discovers that another person in the photo is Tommy Allo 
   (Willie Aames; <B><A HREF="action.htm#KillingMachine1984">KILLING MACHINE</A></B> 
   - 1984), who just happens to be the son of her boss, cable news 
   honcho Bob Allo (Richard Bright; <B><A HREF="vigilante_1982.htm">VIGILANTE</A></B> 
   - 1982). How's that for a coincidence? Mr. Allo sends Fran and Mark 
   to go find his son and, hopelly, get a big story in the process. We 
   then find out that Tommy is being kept prisoner by drug runner Vlado 
   (John Steiner; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Shock1977">BEYOND THE 
   DOOR II</A></B> - 1977) at a jungle camp in Rio Negro. Tommy did try 
   to escape, but he watched as his fellow native escapee is machine-gunned
    to death; his life spared because he is white (White men and women 
   are a valuable commodity in the Amazon). Tommy has also fallen in 
   love with Ana (Valentina Forte; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Blastfighter1984">BLASTFIGHTER</A></B> 
   - 1984), who happens to be Vlado's personal rape toy. Tommy and Ana 
   have secretly radioed pilot Tony Martina (Carlos de Carvalho; <B><A HREF="violent_naples_1976.htm">VIOLENT
    NAPLES</A></B> - 1976) to come pick them up and, as Tommy and Ana 
   are out lighting fire pits to show Tony where to land, Quecho and his 
   natives raid Vlado's camp, where Quecho graphically slits-open guard 
   Carlo's (Ottaviano Dell'Acqua) stomach, as we watch his innards fall 
   to the ground (another scene not shown in the R-Rated cut). As the 
   natives raid the camp, we see more deaths by poison blowdart, a nasty 
   stomach impalement and a gory decapitation by machete. Ana is killed 
   when she returns to camp, while Tommy waits for Tony to land (Fran 
   and Mark are passengers in the plane). As soon as Tony lands the 
   plane, he is killed by a poison dart that comes out of the pilot's 
   window, while Tommy runs into the jungle to avoid the same fate. Fran 
   and Mark do a live report by satellite chronicling the carnage at the 
   camp. Meanwhile, Tommy discovers that Vlado is caught in a jungle 
   booby trap, where he is spread-eagle by two ropes, one attached to 
   each leg. Vlado begs Tommy to kill him, but before Tommy can, he is 
   torn in half from crotch-to-neck (The film's standout scene, which 
   was also not in the R-rated version. It is also obvious that this 
   scene was lifted from a less-than-stellar print.) The remainder of 
   the film documents Fran and Mark's search for Tommy in the Amazon 
   jungle, which is littered with the victims of Quecho and the natives' 
   wrath. Will they find Tommy alive? Do you really care?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film, directed by Ruggero Deodato (<B><A HREF="jungle_holocaust_1976.htm">JUNGLE

    HOLOCAUST</A></B> - 1980), comes late in the Italian &quot;Jungle 
   Horrors&quot; genre and if it weren't for the scenes of graphic gore 
   (The Unrated version is a little over three minutes longer than the 
   R-Rated version. Both versions are on the Blu-Ray.), it would be an 
   insufferable watch. I remember renting the New World VHS of this film 
   and noticing that it was heavily cut , so I went to a video store in 
   my town that only rented tapes in Italian and renting the Unrated 
   version titled <B><A HREF="inferno_in_diretta_italian_vhs.htm">INFERNO
    IN DIRETTA</A></B>, just to see what was cut. It didn't matter that 
   the whole film was dubbed in Italian, I just wanted to see the 
   missing gore (I even made a copy of that tape!) A 2017 interview with 
   Ruggero Deodato (one of the extras on the Blu-ray) reveals that Wes 
   Craven was slated to direct this, but producer Alessandro Fracassi 
   wanted Deodato because he was more popular than Craven, thanks to the 
   notoriety Deodato got from <B>CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST </B>(a claim that I 
   find a little hard to swallow, since Craven released the hugely 
   popular <B><A HREF="nightmare_on_elm_street_1984.htm">A NIGHTMARE ON ELM</A></B><A HREF="cut_and_run_1985_code_red_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cut and run blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A><B><A HREF="nightmare_on_elm_street_1984.htm"> STREET</A></B> 
   just a year earlier). Deodato also goes on to claim that the late 
   Richard Bright (both he and Lisa Blount died relatively young) showed 
   up drunk to film his scenes (it's rather obvious) and actress Karen 
   Black (who has a thankless cameo here as one of Mr. Allo's 
   executives) was able to calm down Deodato, who wanted to fire him. 
   Deodato has nothing but kind words for Black, Richard Lynch and 
   Michael Berryman (his role here is basically silent except for a few 
   grunts and groans), but he doesn't seem to know that Lynch passed 
   away in 2012. Some of his other claims, such as Steven Spielberg and 
   other American filmmakers destroying locations that they film on, 
   just doesn't wash with me, since Deodato is under the impression that 
   Spielberg directed <B><A HREF="platoon_1986.htm">PLATOON</A></B> 
   (1986; No, Mr. Deodato, that was Oliver Stone). Deodato goes on to 
   denigrate all American filmmakers, saying that they don't care about 
   the environment, ensuring that he will never be hired to helm any 
   U.S. production. Listening to Deodato wax nostalgic about <B><A HREF="cut_and_run_1985.htm">CUT
    AND RUN</A></B> makes the film seem more important than it actually 
   is. Richard Lynch has precious little to do here besides look evil 
   and talk in metaphysical terms, but he has the presence of mind to 
   make sure that the cameras are rolling so that his death by 
   decapitation is televised! The screenplay, by Cesare Frugoni (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#GreatAlligator">THE
    GREAT ALLIGATOR</A></B> - 1979) and Dardano Sacchetti (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE

   Luciano Vincenzoni (<B><A HREF="orca_1977.htm">ORCA</A></B> - 1977) 
   tries to explain how cable news has infected our psyches, but it all 
   rings hollow given the situations depicted here.</FONT></FONT><BR>
