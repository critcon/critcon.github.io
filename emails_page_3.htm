        positive review of this film. Of all the many VHS films I rented when

        is one of my favorites. From the moment I popped it into my player, 
        and that scene of the foreboding lake appeared and the haunting music 
        started playing, I knew this would be one weird film. Rich in 
        symbolism, you are correct in saying that it requires more than one 
        viewing to appreciate it. I've read several other reviews of it, and 
        they're invariable snarky, without a clue as to what was going on. I 
        enjoyed this film mainly because of the range of emotions it was able 
        to arouse in me, enhanced, like you noted, by the score. Plus the 
        fact that I always enjoy films that give you a few things to wonder 
        about, along the way. Good job with this one!</B></FONT></FONT></P>

        research on some '80s genre titles for a project I'm working on and 
        stumbled across your website page on 80s video labels. I want to make 
        a comment about the following:</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

         AND THE MONEY HUNGRY PARTY GIRLS</A> were all Camp productions and 
        not licensed product (as erroneously reported by Fred Olen Ray).</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I was the 
        Director of Acquisitions for Troma in 1987.&nbsp; Fred Olen Ray sent 
        me HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS, of course I loved it.&nbsp; I got 
        together the theatrical dept (Carl Morano), home video (Ron ??) and 
        foreign sales (Mike ??), long time -- only sporadically keep in touch 
        with Carl (Media Blasters), and we came up with a sales 
        projection.&nbsp; We jointly went in to meet with Lloyd Kaufman and 
        Michael Herz with a spreadsheet and ad campaign, asking that they sit 
        there and watch the film.&nbsp; After viewing the film I was 
        authorized to make an offer.&nbsp; Alas, as Lloyd and Michael are too 
        cheap, they told me to offer Fred $10K for the negative (he was 
        desperate for cash and wanted $20K).&nbsp; Us staffers pleaded with 
        Lloyd &amp; Michael to go up to $20K as we'd make it back on one sale 
        at MIFED.&nbsp; Lloyd has the $10K/negative imprinted in his brain, 
        for that he missed out on a number of really good titles that went on 
        to acclaimand mega profits. This would have been August/September 1987.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I left Troma 
        and joined Caridi Entertainment.&nbsp; There we had an in-office 
        meeting with Jim Golff of Camp Video (it turned out he went to school 
        with the director [Scott Apostolou] of <A HREF="mutants_in_paradise_1984.htm">MUTANTS
         IN PARADISE</A> that we distributed) to talk about them licensing 
        some titles.&nbsp; We licensed them one, I can't remember which.&nbsp;
         This would have been 1988.&nbsp; At that time Camp was a newish 
        company.&nbsp; It was at this meeting that Golff informed me that 
        they had just put out HCH, he never mentioned that they were one of 
        the producers.&nbsp; (Then again, in this biz people who put up 
        completion money usually wrangle themselves a credit that is a bit misleading.)</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        Retromedia Entertainment has released HCH on DVD. He always releases 
        &quot;iffy&quot; legal titles and will retract them from distribution 
        if he gets a legal letter from the proper rights holder. Let's just 
        say that he doesn't go out of the way to find them (although, in his 
        defense, finding the legal rights holders to some of these films can 
        be a real hassle and sometimes it is downright impossible). Thanks

        imagination (I call him &quot;Britain's answer to Ted V. 
        Mikels&quot;), but he always manages to give his characters a very 
        nasty edge. We here in the U.S. neeed to see more of his films. As 
        far as I know, the only films of his to get a legitimate VHS release 
        in the United Stares were <A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hereafter1983">THE
         HEREAFTER</A> (1983; also reviewed on this site) and the ultimately 
        weird post-apoctalyptic thriller <A HREF="death_run_1987.htm">DEATH RUN</A> 
        (1987). Even a popular site like The Internet Movie Database doesn't 
        list his impressive resume of films. There was a minor shred of hope 
        to see more of his films on DVD from a company called Sarcophilous 
        Films, but they unfortunately went out of business after releasing a 
        couple of his films. - Editor</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

        Zybert and I have recently discovered your Critical Condition 
        website.&nbsp; I am VERY impressed with not only your site, but with 
        the knowledge and enthusiasm you put into it.&nbsp; I can tell you 
        know what you are talking about and since you were writing about 
        horror films at the time of its' release, I was hoping you could help 
        me with some information on the writing credits for the Spanish film <A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A>.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I write a blog, 
        under the psudonym JustinCase, about exploitation films, focusing 
        mostly on the British Video Nasties. While researching the film, I 
        came across numerous references to Aristide Massaccesi/Joe D'Amato 
        using the alias John Shadow for his writing credit. While this has 
        been repeated in numerous places, I have yet to see any real proof of 
        his authorship.&nbsp; There is another filmmaker named John W. Shadow 
        who is credited on imdb with writing PIECES.&nbsp; This John Shadow 
        was married to actress Ewa Aulin who divorced Shadow in 1972. She 
        then starred in Massaccesi's <A HREF="death_smiles_at_a_murderer_1973.htm">DEATH
         SMILES AT A MURDERER</A> in 1973. The connection this woman makes

        alias for Joe D'Amato at all.&nbsp; Mr. Adelman, I can see that you 
        are an authority on genre films with many more years of experience 
        writing about them than myself (and you may know all of what I have 
        said already), and so I ask you: Where can I find the real facts of 
        who wrote this film?&nbsp; Dick Randall, J.P. Simon and Massaccesi 
        have all died, so I can't ask them!&nbsp; Is this information to be 
        found anywhere? Have I missed something?&nbsp; I would really 
        appreciate your help, and I will be sure to give you credit on my 
        blog with any information you can provide.&nbsp; I would like to 
        thank you again for all of your hard work on Critical Condition, you 
        have opened my eyes to the existence of films I had never heard 
        mentioned anywhere else.&nbsp; I will keep reading as long as you

         I have been hearing this rumor for years and there is no concrete 
        proof that Joe D'Amato had anything to do with the screenplay or the 
        story. I'm more inclined to believe that Juan Piquer Simon was using 
        the alias &quot;John Shadow&quot; (Both names begin with 
        &quot;JS&quot;) when writing the screenplay to PIECES. The film 
        contains Simon's patented inaccuracies: Push-button phones and 
        plastic bags in the 1940's prologue and &quot;What The Fuck&quot; 
        moments like the martial arts guy appearing out of nowhere. I'm also 
        a big fan of Joe D'Amato, but this film bears none of his handiwork. 
        At least in my opinion. - Editor</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

         one of countless early budget releases (usually recorded in the

        collects every known version of PSYCHOMANIA (hey, stranger things 
        have happened!). Judging by that generic face label on the VHS tape 
        itself, I'm willing to bet that there weren't too many produced (if I 
        were to hazard a guess, I would say this particular version of the 
        film was sold between 1985 - 1988). Cable channel Turner Classic 
        Movies (TCM) shows a great widescreen version of this film

        One of the obvious giveaways is that the film starts with the Saturn

        Interglobal released all the Regal films in regular cardboard 
        slipcases, not clamshells, usually recorded in the inferior LP or EP 
        Modes. Sorry to tell you that. There's a lot of VHS boots being sold 
        as the real thing. It started with Japanese tapes and then moved 
        across the Pacific Ocean and U.S. tapes were being booted. All it 
        takes is a couple of VHS recorders, a computer and a fairly good 
        inkjet or color laser printer. Also. most bootleggers own a plastic 
        sealer, so their product looks unopened. - Editor</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I like many in 
        the VHS community was sad to hear of Fred's passing, from forum 
        reading I understand a lot of his tapes he hadn't sold himself were 
        being used to pay back rent? And that his childhood friend would be 
        keeping the website going, will there be further sale/auction of VHS 
        to help take care of costs? There are many in the community who would 
        like to assist and help keep Fred's treasures alive rather than them 
        going thrown out or going to someone who doesn't place the proper 
        value on them. In particular, if you, the caretaker of Fred's site/estate,
         do eventually read this, I have been in the pursuit of the film <A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Demon Dolls">DEMON
         DOLLS</A> for nearly 20 years since it's release, Fred has a review 
        for it on his site and I always wanted to believe he possessed an 
        actual copy of this forgotten film. I also know Fred backed up his 
        VHS to DVD-Rs. If a VHS or DVD-R of this film does exist, I would 
        like to contribute to helping pay any outstanding debts by purchasing 
        this and possibly other films, if this film is nowhere in Fred's 
        archives please let me know of any future auction sites or estate 
        sales, thank you.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

        Cinema Sewer (Thanks for sending me the issue, btw!), I absolutely 
        think CS editor/owner Robin Bougie is one of the best writers of 
        genre-related films and adult movies today. I simply love everything 
        he does and encourage everyone to Google Cinema Sewer and become a 
        regular subscriber. There really is a total lack of good zines out 
        there (Has anyone read Tim Lucas' overblown 24-page article on 
        &quot;Continental Op&quot;? in Issue #168 of Video Watchdog? It 
        certainly wasn't my cup of tea [He seems intent of creating new 
        catch-phrases and failing miserably] and shows the shift in tone the 
        zine has taken in the past couple of years. That is why I no longer 
        subscribe to it and I was a subscriber since the very first issue.) 
        and Cinema Sewer is a must for genre fans who don't take offense to 
        drawings and photos of naked female bodies. For Christ's sake, search 
        it out! Subscribing is really the only answer because all the major 
        bookstore chains (not only the ones in Canada) are closing up shop or 
        have cut back on their magazine section. - Editor</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

         can you please remove your bad review from my Amazon E-zine? I 
        don&#146;t make much from writing and publishing Monster Menagerie 
        Magazine. The 70 cents a month stopped completely after you wrote a 
        bad review. Furthermore, the fact that you maintain a website that 
        covers the same film genre puts your review in the position of a 
        conflict of interest. I&#146;ve been a published author, covering 
        monster conversations for paper magazines since 2010 and I&#146;ve 
        learned that getting along with our fellow Monster Fans has more 
        benefits than being snarky. I learned early on that being snarky in

        nude young woman is brought into the room and restrained for the 
        guests to see. The young woman is then subjected to rat torture in 
        which a metal pot/cauldron is placed against her stomach with rats in 
        it and a torch applied to the container as to cause the rats to 
        attack her and burrow out through her stomach. It was a gory scene

         can't say that I ever heard of Orchid, but it is quite possible that

        from the 80's at least once a week and Orchid is merely another one. 
        It's those titles of the martial arts films that you supplied that 
        really has me stymied. I have no ad mats for any of those titles and, 
        believe me, that's quite a feat. Maybe Orchid retitled better-known

        this way. When he looks into a mirror there is some weird pulsating

         will be posting reviews soon, but before that I have quite a story 
        to tell my readers. I was a Facebook member and someone I thought I 
        never heard of before hacked my account and told everyone that I died 
        and my estate needed money to retrieve my collection of movie 
        memorabilia. It seems he &quot;data mined&quot; every bit of 
        information about me that he could find on Facebook (and figured out 
        my password) and created a &quot;mirror&quot; PayPal account and 
        changed all the passwords on my email accounts. I wasn't even aware 
        of this until a friend of mine from Chicago called my 
        ex-sister-in-law and yelled at her for not telling him that I died. I 
        contacted Facebook technicians by phone and told them what was 
        happening (beleive me, for tech-heads these people haven't got a clue 
        what their software does) and eventually they restored my account to 
        my regular password (it took over three weeks!) and had them track 
        this phantom asshole's IP Address who hijacked my account. I quit 
        using Facebook the same day and deleted my account. Since no one put 
        any money in his mirror PayPal account, it seems that he did not 
        commit any arrestable crimes, except to sully my good name and 
        Googling my name will prove it. Now that I have this asswipe's name 
        (seems he was a member of the same non-Facebook forum I was for 
        years), he will get what's coming to him very soon. Here's my warning 
        to everyone who has a Facebook account: You have no privacy at all. 
        People with hacking software and some time on their hands can 
        completely destroy your life (or end it in my case!). Facebook got 
        way too big for its britches and lost control along the way, not to 
        mention there is a total lack of privacy even with all the privacy 
        filters checked-on. Unless you absolutely have to be on Facebook, 
        delete your account (Nothing made me happier than Facebook's IPO 
        taking a nosedive on its first day of trading!). Even when you delete 
        your account, Facebook still keeps all your personal information for 
        at least 90 days! The only thing I do now on the Internet is work on 
        this web site, run my <A HREF="http://www.wensy.com/search.asp?searchtxt=fadelman&amp;searchtype=2">Wensy.com</A> 
        (User Name: fadelman) auction site and answer emails. I refuse to be 
        a member of any corporate &quot;social networking&quot; site that can 
        kill me off without my permission. I may not be in the best of 
        health, but I am still stong enough to TCB. Well, that's my story. - Editor</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

         did an extensive search on all the major search engines and wasn't 
        able to come up with any websites strictly devoted to ZOMBIE. This 
        has also happened to me many times when I look for images and artwork 
        for certain films. The Internet is a wellspring of information (some 
        of it true, most of it false), but it has yet to achieve the status 
        of being the depository of everything genre related. That's not to 
        say that there aren't web sites devoted to the film, but search 
        engines are now all about making money and unless you pay them money 
        for placement (that is why when you look for a certain film, the 
        Internet Movie Database is usually the first choice), it's a 
        hit-or-miss affair. That is why Critical Condition is usually always 
        at the bottom of every search engine out there. And most people don't 
        take the time to look all the way to the bottom. I really don't care, 
        because my core base of fans are fantastic, but I see where it can be 
        a problem for a lot of people. Hey, we all have to make a buck, but I 
        refuse to play by their rules. I will never pay for placement on 
        search engines or put ads on my site. I will continue to say what I 
        please without worrying if some advertiser is going to take offense.

         for the support, I appreciate it, but let's just say Troy and I 
        never saw eye-to-eye. We were never on the best of terms, but when I 
        returned about a year ago to the forum, Troy sent me a PM asking if 
        we could bury the hatchet and be friendly once again. I stupidly 
        agreed. Little did I know that it was a trap and he had been keeping 
        tabs on my &quot;infractions&quot; since the first day that I had 
        returned. It seems every time I disagreed with a poster, Troy would 
        tick it off his imaginary list. When Edwin contacted me a few days 
        after the fracas (In which Kev B [a new member] was being a raving 
        racist), he told me to &quot;take a break, because I don't have time 
        for this&quot;. My account was suddenly restricted, but I wasn't 
        banned. Then Troy sent me a PM later that night telling me to expect 
        the worse. My question is, how the hell would he know if he didn't 
        instigate it? (He basically blamed moderators Wayne and Daniel, whom 
        I never even talked to in a PM!). Troy was once a mod for the forum 
        years ago, but was forced to give it up because Edwin found him 
        unable to be &quot;objectionable&quot;.&nbsp; I'm not surprised that 
        he still has that attitude. Troy and Edwin are much too buried in 
        making money writing liner notes and performing other duties for a 
        certain DVD company (with ties to a known plagarist) to be partial 
        and fair.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        Ian that type of person. I like the guy, even with all our 
        differences.) take control and if you put up a fight or disagree, you

        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">To be honest, 
        Troy said that he didn't instigate the decision (he only pushed for 
        Kev to go, apparently). Take this as you like: I let Troy know by 
        mail a few days ago that I didn't feel the mods were doing their jobs 
        correctly recently (I made it clear that I felt Kev should be banned. 
        Of course I have no say in the matter but I wanted to voice my 
        opinion. He didn't really like this, and said that the whole thing 
        had been blown out of proportion). Today he tells me that he pushed 
        for Kev to be banned. So, that is indeed a little suspect. I'm in 
        agreement with your comment on Troy being unable to be objectionable.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

         sent Troy the same type of PM you did and he went into this missive 
        against me about how I should quit jumping to &quot;negative 
        conclusions&quot; (even though it was apparent to everyone that Kev B 
        was being racist towards Jimmy Simard and his French Canadian 
        heritage). The next thing that happened was I was banned. I find it a 
        little more than suspect. In his general warning thread, it was plain 
        to see that he was sticking up for new posters like mondojustin and 
        Kev B and putting down longstanding posters like Jimmy and myself. 
        And how about Vincent Perierra? He can suddenly come on, make 
        accusations of homosexual bias against me (which couldn't be further 
        from the truth) and I can't even defend myself? Fuck him and fuck 
        Troy. It's apparent he's the brains behind this whole mess since 
        Edwin doesn't give a damn about the site any more. Every time Troy 
        states that it is up to Edwin to make the final decisions, I have to 
        laugh, because it was clearly Troy running the show. I get emails all 
        the time from former members telling me that the AVManiacs forum has 
        turned into nothing more than a DVD release schedule for Arrow, Code 
        Red and Shout! Factory. And a whole lot of bitching about defects in 
        Blu-Ray discs. Not to mention a total lack of new subjects. Who needs

         although that came 16 years or so later and Italian tv must have 
        loosened up quite a bit since The Ogre's days. All in all I miss the 
        Silver Age of Italian horror (I'm reserving the late 60's, 70s &amp; 
        early 80s as the Golden Age), as it's last gasps, D3TO among them, 
        are glaringly absent from today's filmic landscape. I didn't feel 
        that SONNO PROFUNDO (2013) recaptured the true classic giallo vibe 
        although it's aesthetic look was a near-perfect mimic.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

         for your honest opinion. And yes, Virginia Bryant does get wet in 
        the dungeon pool, seeing the corpse of babysitter Maria floating by 
        her (as well as many other rotten corpses). But that's all for 
        naught, especially in the throwaway line Cheryl tells Tom at the end 
        of the film, saying Maria returned home with her boyfriend! It's like 
        none of it ever happened and Cheryl suffers from a case of mental 
        illness! That's just sloppy writing and that is the main reason why 
        the film is so bad to me. I do agree, the Beast was somewhat of an 
        awesome creation, but the film doesn't do it justice, at least for 
        me. Believe me, I do appreciate people sharing their opinions with me 
        and I do know that not everyone shares my opinion, which is why 
        writing reviews is so enjoyable for me. I love hearing other people's 
        opinions, especially when they disagree with me. Hey, if we all 
        thought alike, what a boring world this would be! - Editor</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>
