    U.S.A.</A><A NAME="ActionUSA"></A> (1988) -</B> A film that lives up 
   to it's title. This film's sole purpose is to cram as much stuntwork 
   humanly possible into 89 minutes. This Waco, Texas-lensed obscurity's 
   minimal plot begins with Billy (Ron Shaft) being abducted by goons 
   working for crime kingpin Frank Navarro (80's cameo king Cameron 
   Mitchell) while making love to girlfriend Carmen (Barri Murphy; <B><A HREF="#ArmedForAction">ARMED
    FOR ACTION</A></B> - 1992). The goons hang Billy Ray upside-down in 
   a traveling helicopter to try to get him to reveal where he hid a 
   fortune in diamonds that he stole from Navarro, while Carmen follows 
   the helicopter in her Porche. The goons accidentally drop Billy Ray 
   in a lake, so Carmen picks him up, the goons steal a car and the 
   chase is on (Why the goons didn't just chase them in the helicopter 
   is a question better left unasked). Bil<A HREF="action_usa_1988b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/action usa vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="252" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ly
    Ray obliquely reveals to Carmen the location of the diamonds just 
   before the goons shoot him dead. Before the goons can grab Carmen, 
   she is saved by FBI agents Osborn (Gregory Scott Cummins; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Watchers3">WATCHERS
    III</A></B> - 1994) and McKinnon (William Hubbard Knight), who take 
   her into protective custody. With no planes available (again, a 
   question better left unasked), Osborn and McKinnon must drive their 
   uncooperative witness to their destination, while Carmen tries to 
   decipher the mysterious clues Billy Ray gave her before he died. This 
   gives the film plenty of opportunities to show numerous car chases, 
   gunfights and stunts, as Navarro's hired hitman Drago (Ross Hagen; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#PhantomEmpire1987">THE
    PHANTOM EMPIRE</A></B> - 1987) and assistant Hitch (Hoke Howell; <B><A HREF="#Glove">THE
    GLOVE</A></B> - 1978) try to kidnap Carmen and bring her back to 
   Navarro. That scenario becomes moot when Carmen leads her two FBI 
   escorts to the stolen diamonds. Now, our hapless trio must fight for 
   their lives, which includes a stop at a redneck bar where a huge 
   fight breaks out and Drago takes Osborn hostage. McKinnon and Carmen 
   swing into action to rescue Osborn but, during the daring rescue, 
   McKinnon is seriously injured. Osborn and Carmen (who are growing 
   quite fond of each other) make it to the pick-up point, only to 
   discover that someone Osborn trusted has betrayed them. With 
   McKinnon's life hanging in the balance, Osborn and Carmen must figure 
   a way out of this mess. Lights...Camera...Action!&nbsp; Though 
   nothing but a series of stunts held together by the thinnest plot 
   imaginable, <B><A HREF="action_usa_1988b.htm">ACTION U.S.A.</A></B> 
   is still an enjoyable romp, thanks to the plentiful violence, nudity 
   and humor. This is the first film directed by professional stuntman 
   John Stewart, who would later make the excellent action film <B><A HREF="#Cartel">CARTEL</A></B> 
   (1990; also featuring Cummings) and the disappointing thriller <B><A HREF="click_calendar_girl_killer_1990.htm">CLICK:
    THE CALENDAR GIRL KILLER</A></B> (1991; starring Hagen, who also 
   co-directed). It's easy to see that Stewart was cutting his teeth 
   here, as the stunt sequences are quite good, but he has difficulty 
   when it comes to straight dialogue scenes. Still, this is nothing 
   more than an excuse for Stewart to give his stunt buddies an 
   opportunity to shine, and shine they do. Cars fly through the air, 
   crash through motor homes, houses and explode into fireballs. There 
   are also high falls, fire gags and gunfights galore. While the film 
   tosses all logic out the window from the very first scene (Billy 
   Ray's modified Corvette may be a thing of over-accessorized beauty, 
   but there is no way in hell it would ever be street legal), it's 
   always nice to see Gregory Scott Cummins in a rare good guy role. If 
   stunts and action are your thing, this film is a good bet. William 
   Smith (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Losers 1970">THE LOSERS</A></B> - 1970) 
   puts in an extended cameo as Cummins' crooked boss. Make sure you 
   stay through the closing credits to see some funny outtakes involving 
   Smith and Ross Hagen. Also starring Gary Beall, Malcolm King, David 
   Sanders and Brennon Hatley. Originally released on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Imperial">Imperial

    probably because American soldiers are not looked at by the world 
   under the same glorifying light as they were back in the 80's), where 
   they hired their usual bunch of lower-tier Caucasian actors, dressed 
   them in military fatigues, filmed them running around a wooded park 
   firing their weapons and then spliced the footage into some 
   unreleased Hong Kong or Filipino war film, changing the plot to 
   reflect the inclusion of the newly-shot scenes. As you can imagine, 
   the films are a schizophrenic mess, but they're not without their own 
   twisted entertainment value, even if it's for all the wrong reasons. 
   In <B>HIGH SKY MISSION</B>, the film opens with a General 
   MacArthur-like figure explaining to a small squad of American troops 
   (while a cat walks aimlessly in the background!) that the Japanese 
   are taking over the Philippines by joining forces with Filipino 
   guerillas and killing everyone that don't share their new outlook for 
   the country. Since the Japs just trounced us at Pearl Harbor, the 
   General tells his men that they must go to the Philippines and defeat 
   Tojo before the country is lost forever to the yellow menace. In the 
   film proper, a group of Filipino freedom fighters must battle the 
   Japanese and the guerillas to maintain their territory. When the nine 
   American soldiers agree to help the freedom fighters in their cause 
   (in a hilariously bad edit of old and new footage), but split up to 
   do so, it gives the film an excuse to interrupt the main story every 
   twenty minutes or so to splice in the new footage of the American 
   soldiers firing their weapons at faceless enemy soldiers (When the 
   leader of the Japanese forces hears that the Americans sent over only 
   nine soldiers to fight them, he says, &quot;They're sending a 
   mosquito to fight a buffalo!&quot;). The American soldiers, led by 
   Cobra (Frank Juhasz) and Bazooka (Mike Abbott), see their numbers 
   being slowly thinned-out by a single Japanese soldier, who kills 
   three of the squad before he is cornered and blows himself up with a 
   grenade. The squad (who act more like high school jocks than a 
   well-trained Special Forces squad) then set a trap for an advance 
   squad of guerillas, but the guerillas spot a lit cigarette and the 
   word &quot;Fuck&quot; spelled-out with piss on the ground, both left 
   there by careless American squad members<A HREF="american_force_3_high_sky_mission_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american force 3 high sky mission german dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="234" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>,
    and almost escape the trap. Meanwhile, the Filipino freedom fighters 
   continue to fight the Japs and their guerilla cohorts and must now 
   blow up a bridge that is an important thoroughfare for the Jap supply 
   line. Can they do it? And what will become of the Americans?&nbsp; 
   While nothing but a series of gunfights and explosions, <B>HIGH SKY MISSION</B> 
   is still a complete mess. The dialogue, which consists mainly of 
   exchanges like this between two American soldiers: <I><B>Soldier #1</B></I><B>:</B> 
   &quot;Fuck you!&quot; <I><B>Soldier #2</B></I><B>:</B> &quot;Your 
   mother!&quot; is about as inept as the American soldiers themselves. 
   They are the most careless and juvenile bunch of soldiers that you're 
   ever likely to see. Since the film is set during World War II, 
   imagine my surprise in spotting 60's-era fighter jets, helicopters 
   and weapons prominently displayed throughout. That's partly what 
   makes these films so endearing. The filmmakers just don't care about 
   things so miniscule as coherency, matching shots or keeping within 
   the proper timeline, as long as they can turn in a film that is 
   feature length. Director Philip Ko (also responsible for the first 
   two films in this series, <B><A HREF="american_force_1_the_brave_platoon_1988.htm">AMERICAN
    FORCE 1: THE BRAVE PLATOON</A></B> [1988] and <B><A HREF="american_force_2_untouchable_glory_1988.htm">AMERICAN
    FORCE 2: THE UNTOUCHABLE GLORY</A></B> [1988]) and screenwriter 
   &quot;Benny Chu&quot; (actually a pseudonym for Godfrey Ho, who 
   directed the fourth film in this series, <B><A HREF="#AmericanForce4">AMERICAN
    FORCE 4: SOLDIER TERMINATORS</A></B> [1988]) have created a 
   patchwork film where nothing makes any sense. People do the most 
   asinine things at the most inopportune times, the dialogue is 
   ridiculous and the matching of old and new footage looks to have been 
   done by a blind man. This film has to look up just to be at ground 
   level and that's what makes it so watchable. Also starring Arthur 
   Garrett, Gregory Rivers, Peter Bosch, Patrick Hedman, Alan English, 
   Tim Nugent, Edowan Bursmea, Geoffrey Paul, Man Wai Lam, James Hsu, 
   Chung Hung Lau, Ernest Yik and Yik Chee Wong. Never available on home

    FORCE 4: SOLDIER TERMINATORS</A><A NAME="AmericanForce4"></A> (1988) -</B> 
   This is the fourth of six cut-and-paste war actioners from producers 
   Joseph Lai and Betty Chan's IFD Films &amp; Arts Ltd. production 
   company and directed by Godfrey Ho or Philip Ko using a variety of 
   aliases (here, Ho directed using the name &quot;Charles Lee&quot; and 
   scripted using the pseudonym &quot;Benny Hyman&quot;), all of them 
   under the &quot;<B>AMERICAN FORCE</B>&quot; banner (later changed to &quot;<B>AEROLITE
    FORCE</B>&quot; to downplay the American angle, thanks, in part, to 
   the negative way America is perceived in the world today) and all of 
   them unrelated. In this chapter, a squad of American soldiers hire a 
   Filipino named Alexander Sampson (in an awful example of intercutting 
   old and new footage, the old footage being an unreleased Filipino war 
   actioner) to go undercover and join the revolutionary group The New 
   People's Freedom Army, who are looking for new recruits to help 
   overthrow the government. Alexander, along with a handful of new 
   recruits, are blindfolded and brought by boat to the Freedom Army's 
   training camp on an island somewhere in Malaysia, where they all go 
   through basic training by the Freedom Army's leader, Abdul. Alexander 
   turns out to be the most gifted of the new recruits, so after the 
   training sessions are over, Abdul puts Alexander in charge of his own 
   squad o<A HREF="american_force_4_soldier_terminators_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american force 4 soldier terminators poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>f
    soldiers and tells him to help &quot;carry on the cause&quot;. 
   Alexander and his squad head for the mainland and join forces with a 
   larger Freedom Army squad, where they plan on attacking government 
   military outposts. Meanwhile, in the newly-shot footage that 
   interrupts the old footage every twenty minutes or so, a trio of 
   American soldiers, led by the eyepatch-wearing Tom (Paul John 
   Stanners), try to rendezvous with Alexander, but are met with 
   resistance by Commander Victor (Anders Hallberg), who sends his men 
   to kill the trio. This leads to several scenes of gunfights and 
   hand-to-hand combat. When the military forces attacks Alexander's 
   camp and many Freedom Army members are killed or injured, the camp's 
   leader believes &quot;someone sold us down the river&quot; and begins 
   his search for the traitor. Alexander finds himself in quite the 
   conundrum when he falls in love with female Freedom Army member Terry 
   and finds himself torn between his sense of duty and affairs of the 
   heart. How will he resolve his problem? Will Tom meet Commander 
   Victor for a showdown to the death in the finale? If you've seen any 
   of Godfrey Ho's pastiche films, I think you already know the 
   answers.&nbsp; This is a particularly weak film, even for Godfrey Ho, 
   and that's saying a lot. While there are some bloody action 
   sequences, including Alexander scooping-up a man who just had both 
   his arms blown off below the elbows (played by an apparently real 
   double-amputee, who looks like his stumps were dipped in stage 
   blood), the film itself is a bloody mess and doesn't make an ounce of 
   sense. For one, Alexander is sent to infiltrate the People's Army and 
   then report back to Tom, but there are already so many traitors 
   within the group, it's hard to believe that Alexander could possibly 
   have any new intelligence to offer. The film really bogs down during 
   the middle section, where Alexander gets into a battle with the 
   military and gets his kneecap blown off, which results in the 
   amputation of his leg. Rather than retiring and taking it easy for 
   the rest of his life, he agrees to help Tom (in another badly edited 
   sequence of old and new footage) by continuing to stay undercover at 
   the People's Army. He simply straps-on a prosthetic leg and continues 
   his mission, oblivious to the fact that the same people he is working 
   for are the ones responsible for the loss of his leg! The newly-shot 
   footage is standard Godfrey Ho fodder: People duking it out or firing 
   guns at each other, which offers nothing to the rest of the film 
   (Although Tom repeating &quot;Get up and fight!&quot; over and over 
   to one of Victor's goons and then shooting him in the back when he 
   does is pretty funny, as is the final shot, where one of Tom's men 
   fakes getting shot and then jumps up to surprise them when they rush 
   to his aide. I would have shot him for real on the spot!). As normal 
   for these films, the English dubbing is a hoot (&quot;Tell that to 
   the guy way down in Hell!&quot; is my favorite line of dialogue 
   here), but the lack of full balls-on action hampers one's enjoyment. <B><A HREF="american_force_5_mission_dymano_1988.htm">AMERICAN

    JUSTICE</A><A NAME="AmericanJustice"></A> (1985) -</B> During the 
   late 70's and 80's, illegal immigration from Mexico was a hot topic 
   (it's regained it's popularity as a hot-button political issue as of 
   late) and films were made to cash-in on the subject, including Telly

   (1980) and Jack Nicholson in <B><A HREF="border_1982.htm">THE BORDER</A></B> 
   (1982). This film, originally known as <B>JACKALS</B> (a term for 
   people who guide the illegals across the border), was one of the 
   last. Ex-cop Joe Case (Jack Lucarelli) comes to an unnamed Arizona 
   border town (actually filmed in Nogales, Arizona) to visit his 
   ex-partner Dave Buchanon (Jameson Parker), a U.S. Border Patrol cop, 
   and his wife Jess (Jeannie Wilson). While riding a horse alone in the 
   desert, Joe watches as crooked Border Patrol cop Jake Wheeler (Gerald 
   McRaney) shoots and kills a female wetback as she tries to escape 
   after Jake raped her. Joe and Dave go to headquarters to report the 
   killing to Sheriff Lawrence Mitchell (Wilford Brimley), but Jake is 
   in the room (and it's at this time that Joe realizes that Jake is a 
   cop). Joe tells <A HREF="american_justice_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american justice vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Dave
    that Jake is the killer and when they go to the scene of the crime, 
   the body is missing (Jake had one of his cronies rebury the body in 
   another location). With no victim to be found, it's Joe's word 
   against Jake's and even Dave has a hard time believing it. Just to be 
   sure, Dave has his friend Warner (Warner Glenn), an expert tracker, 
   go over the crime scene again. He finds a trail to follow and they 
   find the girl buried in a new grave. Warner tracks the guy that 
   reburied her and Dave arrests him, but Jake kills him with automatic 
   sniper fire to keep him from talking. Sheriff Mitchell begins to 
   suspect Jake when his alibi for the girl's murder doesn't pan out, 
   but he can't do anything without more proof (among other reasons to 
   be disclosed later). Joe and Dave cross the border to get proof of 
   Jake's illegal women-selling business, where we learn that Sheriff 
   Mitchell was Jake's business partner. When Jake threatens Jess' life 
   and then kills Dave (in a scene that's pretty hard to watch), a 
   wounded Joe must find a way to bring Jake down. Joe travels down to 
   Mexico on a tip from a remorseful Sheriff Mitchell to get revenge the 
   old-fashioned way, using the same shotgun to kill Jake that Jake used 
   to kill Dave. It takes three blasts to kill Jake, but Joe seem to 
   relish every pull of the trigger.&nbsp; This is a pretty decent low-budget
    action flick that got some minor notoriety when it was made because 
   both Jameson Parker (<B><A HREF="prince_of_darkness_1987.htm">PRINCE 
   OF DARKNESS</A></B> - 1987) and Gerald McRaney<B> </B>(who got his 
   career started by appearing in such low-rent horror films like <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Night Bloody Horror">NIGHT
    OF BLOODY HORROR</A></B> - 1969) were co-starring at the time on the 
   successful comedy detective TV series <B><A HREF="simon_and_simon_tv_series_1981-1989.htm">SIMON
    &amp; SIMON</A></B> (1981 - 1989). Made during summer hiatus in 
   1985, this film must have come as a shock to fans of the series, 
   especially Parker's death at the hands of McRaney who, at the time, 
   wasn't really known for playing bad guys (He showed us much later 
   that he would excel at it, especially on HBO's Western series <B><A HREF="deadwood.htm">DEADWOOD</A></B>).
    Even though Wilford Brimley gets top billing, he has very little to 
   do here besides looking concerned and trying to atone for his sins in 
   the end. The script, by Dennis A. Pratt (who also plays the role of 
   Connie, one of Jake's men), concentrates on Gerald McRaney's and Jack 
   Lucarelli's (who's rather bland) characters, making this a study in 
   contrasts. The gauntlet in the apartment building that Jameson Parker 
   and Lucarelli (who are both the Producers on this) have to shoot 
   their way through, resulting in Parker's death at McRaney's hands, is 
   expertly filmed and a nail-biter. Director Gary Grillo (this is his 
   only movie directorial credit, although he did direct an episode of 
   Parker's and McRaney's series and was Assistant Director on many 
   films, such as <B><A HREF="bloody_mama_1970.htm">BLOODY MAMA</A></B> 
   - 1970) keeps things moving at a brisk clip and films nearly every 
   scene with an over-abundance of dusty atmosphere. It makes you 
   thirsty just watching it. It enjoyed this film, thanks to McRaney's 
   badass performance and some well-staged gunfights. Give it a try.

    OF FURY</A><A NAME="AngelOfFury1991"></A> (1991) -</B> Here's an 
   Indonesian action film starring high-kicking Cynthia Rothrock and 
   written by Christopher Mitchum (sorry to report that he doesn't 
   appear on-screen). Rothrock is courier Nancy Bolan, who enters 
   Jakarta carrying a metal case that may or may not contain a 
   top-secret computer coveted by bad guy Nick Stewart (Peter O'Brian; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Stabilizer">THE
    STABILIZER</A></B> - 1984; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Intruder1986">THE INTRUDER</A></B> 
   - 1986). When Nancy manages to get her case stolen after a fight on a 
   dock, followed by a speedboat/jet ski chase, she makes it her mission 
   to protect the other two metal cases that will soon arrive in town, 
   one being a decoy case and the other containing the real computer. 
   Guess what? She ends up losing both of those cases, too; one at an 
   airport that erupts into a gunfight and another that is dropped off 
   by helicopter, which results in another gunfight and a car/helicopter 
   explosion. It's apparent that Nancy has a traitor amongst her ranks, 
   but she gets fired from her position because she was in charge of the 
   operation. Now that Nick (who for some reason is now called 
   &quot;Bolt&quot;) has all three cases, he still needs Nancy to open 
   them because all the cases are rigged with bombs that will explode if 
   not opened using the right code. Nick <A HREF="angel_of_fury_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/angel of fury vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="287" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>has
    his men kidnap Sarah (Kiki Amir), a little girl who is close to 
   Nancy, in a crowded mall, which leads to a car/motorcycle chase that 
   results in Sarah getting shot in the back and dying in Nancy's arms 
   (Geesh, Nancy really isn't good at protecting things, is she?). Nick 
   finally kidnaps Nancy (with a knock-out dart to the neck) and 
   tortures her (in a scene lifted directly from <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_1987.htm">LETHAL
    WEAPON</A></B> - 1987) to get the combination to the cases. She 
   gives up the codes rather easily, but it seems Nick really only has 
   two of the cases and they are both the dummies. Nancy figures out who 
   has the third case (it's someone very close to her), which leads to 
   an extended fight/stunt sequence in an abandoned warehouse, where the 
   case passes from person to person until only one is left standing. 
   Can you guess who that will be?&nbsp; Although quite violent at 
   times, this Indonesian actioner, directed by Ackyl Anwari (<B><A HREF="virgins_from_hell_1987.htm">VIRGINS
    FROM HELL</A></B> - 1987), seems to be lacking in the plot 
   department and thanks to some friends overseas, I now know why. The 
   version available on U.S. VHS is shorn of nearly twenty minutes and 
   clocks-in at barely 72 minutes long. It was also retitled (it was 
   made under the title <B><A HREF="triple_cross_1991.htm">TRIPLE CROSS</A></B> 
   and is available in foreign markets under that name), re-dubbed and re-scored
    in Los Angeles, disposing of the original titles, dialogue and music 
   tracks. Sadly, most of the missing footage seems to deal with Peter 
   O'Brian's character, who is called &quot;Bolt&quot; throughout the 
   film even though in the closing credits he's listed as &quot;Nick 
   Stewart&quot;. Besides the opening scene, where O'Brian is torturing 
   a man with a machete and a hand-powered drill (a huge chunk of this 
   sequence seems to be missing, as it opens on a jarring note), we 
   don't see much of him until the finale, which severely minimalizes 
   his bad guy status (One funny bit of dialogue has Rothrock mockingly 
   calling him &quot;Rambo&quot;). There are plenty of chases, stunts, 
   bloody bullet squib deaths (including the little girl) and Ms. 
   Rothrock's high-kicking abilities, but by editing out much of the 
   exposition scenes, this version of the film deprives fans of 
   Indonesian insanity one of the major enjoyments of watching these 
   films: The crazy dialogue. Without that, all we have to enjoy is the 
   violence, making <B>ANGEL OF FURY</B> seem more like an American 
   action film than an Indonesian one, something I'm sure the 
   powers-that-be that had this recut were aiming for. Try to find the 
   full version instead. It's out there if you do your homework. 
   Produced by Gope T. Samtani for Rapi Films. Deddy Armand, who wrote 
   the screenplays for some of the most balls-out Indonesian actioners 
   (including the two previously mentioned O'Brian starrers, as well as 
   the Chris Mitchum opus <B><A HREF="action.htm#Final Score">FINAL SCORE</A></B> 
   [1986], the best Indo action flick of all time), is given story 
   credit here. Since this is Mitchum's only credited screenplay, logic 
   dictates that Armand was probably responsible for 90% of the script.

   low-budget regional actioner, police Sgt. Phil Towers (David Harrod) 
   is transporting Mafia hitman David Montel (Rocky Patterson) across 
   country by car (why they didn't take a plane is never explained) for 
   his trial in Los Angeles. They stop in a small Texas town for a bite 
   to eat, unaware that crooked cops Detective West (Joe Estevez) and 
   Detective Carter (Dean Nolen) have brought some Mafia goons to this 
   town, cut the phone lines and are waiting to ambush Sgt. Towers and 
   kill Montel, because his testimony could put a lot of crooked cops 
   and Mafia chieftans behind bars. Two local yokels, Alex (J. Scott 
   Guy) and Jake (Shane Boldin), grow suspicious of all the new faces in 
   town (who seem to outnumber the local population 5 to 1) and end up 
   helping Sgt. Towers fight the bad guys. When West tries to kill 
   Montel while he is taking a shit in the bathroom of the town's diner, 
   Towers shoots West (he only wings him in <A HREF="armed_for_action_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/armed for action vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the

   (Barri Murphy), Alex's girlfriend. When the crooked cops kill the 
   town sheriff (Jack Gould) and Jake's girlfriend Lori (Tracy 
   Spaulding), Jake and Alex (who are avid hunters) go to the bar to 
   lend a hand to Towers, while Sarah tries to find a way out of town 
   and get help. She fails miserably and is taken prisoner. When West 
   and his men surround the bar, Towers has no choice but to trust 
   Montel. He gives Montel a gun and the quartet are able to escape the 
   bar and go to Alex's house where, just like any good Texan, he has a 
   stash of automatic weapons and hand grenades. When West and his goons 
   surround Alex's house and threaten Sarah's life, Montel turns hero 
   and saves her life. With Sarah now safely in Alex's arms, Towers, 
   Jake, Alex and Montel begin picking-off West's men one-by-one until 
   only West is left. West and Montel agree to go at it mano-a-mano, but 
   Montel pulls a fast one and shoots West dead. Towers lets Montel walk 
   away to freedom, but promises to recapture him some day. This 
   impossibly-cheap action flick, directed by Bret McCormick (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Abomination">THE

    ATTACK OF THE REDNECK MUTANTS</A></B> - 1986), is terrible for one 
   reason only: It has no action. Talky to the point of making you think 
   you're watching a Henry Jaglom film, <B>ARMED FOR ACTION</B> fails 
   miserably as an action film and the unbelievable situations and plot 
   devices (script by actor Ted Prior, who had the good sense not to 
   appear in this) further pulls this flick down into the mire. When Joe 
   Estevez (who is absolutely horrible here) says to bartender Sarah, 
   &quot;Where I come from, a buck-fifty doesn't pay for the ice!&quot; 
   after she charges him $1.50 for a bourbon, you'll be screaming that 
   the producers (Executive Produced by David Winters and David Prior) 
   should have put that $1.50 into the film's budget. The most glaring 
   budgetary restriction is the town itself. It's only populated by five 
   residents and it tries to (unconvincingly) explain this away by 
   telling us that everyone's away hunting! Oh, really? Does that 
   include all the women and children, too? We know that there are 
   supposed to be children in this town because a schoolbus comes into 
   play (lamely, I might add) in the quartet's escape from the bar. By 
   the time we get to the film's money shot, the shootout at Alex's 
   house, the viewer has long-since lost interest. Joe Estevez looks 
   like he's in a coked-out haze throughout this film and either screams 
   out his lines or delivers them in a wide-eyed stare. I'm sure brother 
   Martin Sheen is very proud. This film is about as much fun as slicing 
   your dick open with a paring knife and dipping it in gasoline. Also 
   starring Kirk McKinney and John Pask. Director McCormick (who 
   sometimes uses the name &quot;Max Raven&quot;) made a bunch of

   the Hollywood System), but even his worst later films (like <B><A HREF="ghosts_of_mars_2001.htm">GHOSTS
    OF MARS</A></B> - 2001) are better than most horror flicks 
   (Especially after more than one viewing. Try it and you may agree 
   with me.). I consider <B><A HREF="assault_on_precinct_13_1976b.htm">ASSAULT
    ON PRECINCT 13</A></B> one of his crowning achievements, not because 
   it is well acted or even well paced, but because it shows what a 
   fledgling director can do with plenty of imagination on what had to 
   be an extremely small budget. The majority of the film takes place at 
   a nearly abandoned police precinct (a newer one has been built across 
   town), where police officer Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker; <B><A HREF="#ZebraKiller">THE
    ZEBRA KILLER</A></B> - 1974), dispatcher Leigh (Lauurie Zimmer; who 
   had a very short acting career. This was her first film and her last 
   film was a bit part in the TV movie <B><A HREF="survival_of_dana_1979.htm">THE
    SURVIVAL OF DANA</A></B> in 1979) and a skeleton crew must deal with 
   a final busload of prisoners who are being delivered to the precinct. 
   As soon as the prisoners step off the bus, most of them are 
   picked-off by a huge gang equipped with sniper rifles with silencers, 
   before Ethan pulls prisoner Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston; <B><A HREF="harry novak.htm#Rattlers">RATTLERS</A></B> 
   - 1976) out the bus and puts him in a cell. For some reason (never 
   made clear in the film), all the gangs in town have banded together 
   and have only one thing on their mind: Taking over Precinct 13 and 
   killing everyone inside (An earlier scene shows a little girl [Kim 
   Richards; <B><A HREF="car_1977.htm">THE CAR</A></B> - 1977, before 
   becoming a national joke on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills 
   reality show during the 2010 - 2011 season] getting an ice cream cone 
   from a truck [whose driver has just been killed and replaced by a 
   gang member] and then getting unmercifully shot in the chest by a 
   smiling gang member and dying on the sidewalk. The look she gives 
   after being shot will live in your memory far a long time and 
   whenever you mention this film to someone, this is the scene they 
   immediately remember and rightfully so. It's one of the 70's most 
   powerful moments in an action film.). Ethan and Napoleon form an 
   uneasy alliance as the gangs first shoot out all the windows and then 
   start picking-off the people in the precinct one-by-one. Ethan lets 
   Napolean out of his jail cell and gives him weapons, a trust that is 
   not looked upon as reasonable by some of the precinct's inhabitants. 
   When the gang go on a full-out assault on the precinct, the 
   nay-sayers change their minds almost immediately, as Napoleon proves 
   to be a huge asset.&nbsp; Carpenter definitely based this film on the 
   Western films of John Ford (the Indians attacking the fort) and 
   George Romero's <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT 
   OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1968; the zombies attacking the living), 
   as the gang members keep coming (as one is gunned down, another takes 
   his place) and they never utter a single word. Making them silent was 
   a gutsy move by Carpenter, because we really have no idea why this 
   gang are doing what they are doing. Their only motivation seems to be 
   kill, kill, kill, something that was new to the genre of action films 
   at the time. While the acting is nothing to write home about, Darwin 
   Joston has one killer final bit of dialogue as the film ends and will 
   have you smiling from ear-to-ear. This is a great action film to be 
   seen with a group of friends, because if they have never seen it, 
   they will thank you later and if they have seen it before, you 
   probably will never have anyone give you a thumbs-down. It's a great 
   sophomore effort by a talented director that is full of buzzing 
   bullets, shattering glass, flying paper, people dying and an 
   unnerving sense of unease that stays with you until the final scene. 
   If you have never seen it, buy all means put it on your must-see 
   list. Please ignore the awful <A HREF="assault_on_precinct_13_2005.htm">2005

   DANGEROUS GAME</A></B> (1932) is edge-of-your-seat entertainment from 
   beginning to end and is probably Michael Dudikoff's best film role. 
   The film opens up with two Special Forces agents being hunted down by 
   four masked killers in the Louisiana bayou. After the men are killed, 
   we find out the killers form four points of the Pentangle Hunting 
   Fraternity, a sick group of politically-connected thrill seekers who 
   &quot;hunt&quot; people that don't fall into their twisted criteria 
   of what's best for America. The leader of the Pentangle is 
   Glastenbury (the late <A HREF="late breaking news.htm#John Ryan">John 
   P. Ryan</A>, in one of his best villianous roles) and the next target 
   is Councilman Larry Richards (the late Steve James), who is running 
   for Senator and, since he is Black, makes him a target for the 
   all-white Pentangle. They try to kill Larry while he is riding on a 
   float with his family during Mardi Gras, but Larry's best friend Matt 
   Hunter (Dudikoff), an ex-Secret Service agent turned rancher, is 
   along for the ride and stops the assassination, but not before one of 
   Larry's young sons is shot and<A HREF="avenging_force_1986b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/avenging force vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   killed. Pentangle, pissed that they missed their target, redouble 
   their efforts and now have Matt in their sights, too. Their next 
   attempt ends badly for more members of Pentangle, as Matt and Larry 
   kill them on a docked ship and issue a challenge to Pentangle. 
   Glastenbury accepts and sends his men to Matt's farm, where they burn 
   down his house, kill Larry (with a crossbow bolt to the back), his 
   wife and other son (both shot at close range) and kidnap Matt's young 
   sister Sarah (Allison Gereighty). They make Matt play the game where 
   the four members of Pentangle are the hunters and Matt is the prey. 
   After Matt saves Sarah from a bayou brothel run by a transvestite 
   madam, they must travel through the swamp while Glastenbury and his 
   three masked cohorts are close behind. Matt will have to use all his 
   Secret Service training, as he kills three members of the hunting 
   party one-by-one, by impalement, crossbow and knife. Glastenbury gets 
   away, but not for long, as Matt shows up at his home and they battle 
   using the many weapons scattered throughout Glastenbury's 
   well-equipped home. Matt wins and then makes a surprising discovery 
   as to who the fifth point of the Pentangle really is.&nbsp; Directed 
   with energy by Sam Firstenberg (who also directed Dudikoff and James 
   in <B><A HREF="american_ninja_1985.htm">AMERICAN NINJA</A></B> a year 
   earlier) and written by James Booth (who also has a key role as 
   Admiral Brown), <B><A HREF="avenging_force_1986.htm">AVENGING FORCE</A></B> 
   is just one breath-taking action setpiece after another. The Mardi 
   Gras massacre in the beginning is one such sequence, where dozens of 
   innocent bystanders, cops and members of the parade are gunned down, 
   while Matt and Larry disarm and kill the assailants. Shortly 
   afterwards, there's a stunt-filled car chase that ends on a docked 
   ship, where Matt and Larry deliver their second beatdown of the 
   Pentangle. Glastenbury gets so pissed off at the end result, he 
   shoots fellow member Parker (Loren Farmer) in the gut for his 
   bungling of the hit and leaves him on the ground bleeding and moaning 
   as he walks away. There are also shocking bits of violence, such as 
   the attack on Matt's house, where Larry, his wife and son (who takes 
   a real nasty fall off a burning roof with Matt) all die horribly. 
   John P. Ryan stands out in his role as a man with no conscience (if 
   he had a mustache, he would be twirling it!), as we see in the finale 
   when, even though he's been stabbed in the leg by Matt just a few 
   scant hours earlier, we see him having a formal dinner with family 
   and friends as if nothing ever happened. He is capably backed up by 
   character actors Marc Alaimo and Bill &quot;Superfoot&quot; Wallace 
   as members of his hunting party. This Cannon Films production 
   (Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus were the producers) is one of their

   crossbow bolt. Frank, Jim and Lance make their way to an en<A HREF="black_fire_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black fire dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>emy
    POW camp, but when they see that all of the American prisoners have 
   been moved someplace else (Frank mentions the &quot;Hanoi 
   Hilton&quot;), they still decide to attack the camp using grenades, 
   more explosive crossbow bolts and good, old-fashioned gunfire. Lance 
   is killed and Frank suffers from a nasty case of head trauma from an 
   enemy grenade, but Jim rescues him and brings him to a hospital, 
   where Frank has flashbacks to when he was a child and his grandfather 
   trained him to become a ninja (Say what now?). Frank and Jim are 
   transferred to a South American island called San Sebastian to become 
   training officers. After meeting their Commanding Officer (Ruel 
   &quot;Ray&quot; Vernal), Frank and Jim go to a bar for a drink and 
   get into a fight with the locals (What would a Teddy Page film be 
   without a bar fight?). Frank is nearly choked to death, but he has 
   another flashback to his youth and uses his grandfather's ninja 
   training to break the hold. Frank tells Jim about his flashbacks and 
   how he may be a ninja, but Jim just laughs, blaming the head trauma 
   he received in Vietnam. Frank begins taking late night walks around 
   the base and discovers his Commanding Officer is working in cahoots 
   with local crimelord Luis Sanchez (Anthony Carreon) to ship illegal 
   arms to Africa. When Sanchez discovers the truth about Frank's 
   background (he has a red folder marked &quot;BlackFire&quot; that 
   contains Frank's entire life story), he orders the Commanding Officer 
   to kill Frank. The C.O. has Roberto (Jim Moss) try to kill Frank, but 
   Frank's ninja skills save him from getting a bullet between the eyes. 
   Frank and Jim, with the help of the C.O.'s secretary, Nancy 
   (Charlotte Maine), try to bring all the guilty parties to justice, 
   but when Nancy is viciously stabbed to death by Roberto and Frank is 
   framed for her murder (Roberto dips Nancy's dead finger in her own 
   blood and writes &quot;BlackFire&quot; on the floor), Jim has Frank 
   arrested and thrown into a South American prison (so much for being 
   good friends!), where Frank is tortured and abused (including that 
   old prison standby, the pressure hose shower). Frank escapes from 
   prison, regains Jim's trust and goes on a one-man killing spree to 
   get even with all those that wronged him.&nbsp; While the screenplay 
   is all over the place (the fictional South American island of San 
   Sebastian sure looks an awful lot like the Philippines!) and hardly 
   makes an ounce of sense, the always entertaining director Teddy Page 
   (real name: Teddy Chiu) fills the screen with violent action, whether 
   it is gunfights, explosions or hand-to-hand combat. This film 
   switches constantly from war actioner, to crime drama to prison 
   escape drama, but Page never forgets to deliver the bloody goods, 
   whether it is neck-snapping, slit throats, stabbings or bullet-ridden 
   bodies. The final thirty minutes are especially memorable, as Frank 
   uses his ninja training to bust out of prison (his eyepatch disguise 
   fools no one, though) and, with Jim's help, does a lot of explosive 
   damage. Rom(ano) Kristoff is his usual stiff presence as an actor 
   (but he's a damn good action hero) and it's always good to see Jim 
   Gaines get a larger than normal role (even if he has to write it 
   himself!). <B><A HREF="black_fire_1985c.htm">BLACK FIRE</A></B> (also

    finds his house and family taken hostage by foreign terrorists (or 
   so he thinks), the government agency (C.C.O.) that surrounds his 
   house tries to kill him for reasons yet unknown. Bad mistake. After 
   taking out about a half dozen agents at their headquarters, Campbell 
   goes on a one-man war to stop the insanity. Along the way he finds 
   out that the government is preparing to let loose a nerve agent in a 
   neighborhood to see what effects it has on the populace. They plan on 
   making it look as if terrorists are doing the nasty deed. They call 
   this plan Black Friday and this action is to take place in his 
   neighborhood. Campbell recruits some of his old Special Ops buddies 
   to help him stop the attack while the other agency employs an old 
   enemy of Campbell's from his Special Ops squadron. The action is 
   minimal but potent when it does happen and Gary Daniels (also a 
   Producer here) is still one of the best martial arts/actors making 
   films today. Director Darren Doane (usually a music video director) 
   creates a sense of compassion in Campbell that is very rare in action 
   films today. Of course he's a successful businessman with a secret 
   past, but he actually cares about people and the actions that they 
   take. (As the head bad C.C.O. guy says: &quot;A truly benevolent God 
   would never let me inhabit this Earth.&quot;) The ending is 
   especially unusual for an action film and takes place a few months 
   after the smoke clears. Daniels is sitting in a diner all alone and 
   strikes up a conversation with the singing counterman about how he is 
   traveling across the United States all alone. The sequence says 
   nearly all there is to say about his character. The music soundtrack 
   is also a major plus (probably thanks to director Doane) as trance, 
   thrash metal and emo play in the background to enhance the mood. I 
   would recommend this film to all fans of action who like a little to 
   think about while watching people getting shot, stabbed or beaten to 
   a pulp. Also starring Christopher J. Stapleton, Ryan Kos, Christopher 
   Janney, Markus Botnick and Paul Gunning. A Trinity Home Entertainment

   Meanwhile, the black gangs are ridding their streets of white pushers

   extremely large collar. J.J. and his gang (one who carries a spear!) 
   kidnap stuttering white drug pusher Cockroach (John Alderman) and 
   interrogate him (in a huge room with a single chair) about where and 
   when the next big drug shipment is happening. After Burton sets up 
   some brothers on trumped-up gun charges, J.J. goes on the offensive 
   and intercepts the big drug shipment, killing some of Burton's men in 
   the process. Burton kills Nate and kidnaps J.J.'s girlfriend Yvonne

   drug shipment (Burton says, &quot;It's time to teach this spook the

   Yvette kidnapped and blackmails Mark (using the photos) into killing 
   people Bill says are criminals that need killing. Bill sends hit 
   woman Liza (Ann Milhench) to accompany Mark on the assigned hits, 
   telling him that if anything happens to Liza, his wife will die. As 
   they go on their killing spree, Mark has an old Vietnam buddy check

   little-known (and rarely-seen) Filipino &quot;Muslim rebels vs. 
   Christian military&quot; action film with a strong religious (mainly 
   pro-Muslim) storyline and a huge cast of Filipino talent (The opening 
   credits lists over thirty actors, many who should be recognized by 
   fans of this genre). The film opens with a battle between rebel 
   factions and the Philippines military, where rebel leader Hadji is 
   captured and sent to prison. A kind Colonel allows Hadji to see his 
   family, including young son Basaron (Mabuhay Shiragi), one last time 
   before he spends the rest of his life behind bars, where he tells 
   Basaron to always obey the law, put his trust in God and not end up 
   like him. The Colonel then promises Hadji to keep a close eye on his 
   family and we then watch Basaron grow up in front of our eyes (thanks 
   to the magic of camera dissolves) as he prays in a mosque. The adult

   be a lawyer and is dating the beautiful Narsheva (Rosemarie De Vera), 
   when he learns that his father was just pardoned from prison. The 
   townspeople hail Hadji as a local hero, but Basaron, who hasn't seen 
   his father since that day in prison when he was a little boy, is a 
   little retice<A HREF="blood_war_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood war german dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>nt
    of his father's hero status since he has grown up following the 
   straight and narrow. Complicating matters is the dastardly Bashir 
   (Renato Del Prado), who has the hots for Narsheva, so he rapes her to 
   stop her from marrying Basaron. Narsheva must marry Bashir to save 
   face (Apparently, Muslim religion is very strict when it comes to 
   women losing their virginity), but she really loves Basaron, who 
   returns back to college after putting a beat-down on Bashir when he 
   catches him slapping Narsheva around. Another civil war breaks out in 
   Basaron's Mindanao village and martial law is put into effect by the 
   military. When Basaron returns home, he is made offers by both sides 
   of the struggle. The rebels want him and his father to join the cause 
   (his father flatly refuses because he is now too old) and the 
   friendly Colonel (who is now a General) wants him to join the Air 
   Force. Basaron, who would rather be left out of this mess and finish 
   up his studies to become a lawyer, decides to become a member of the 
   Air Force, with his father's blessing. Basaron's life in the military 
   is not an easy one because the majority of military recruits are 
   Christians and his loyalty is constantly put into question. Basaron 
   quickly puts those questions to rest when he heroically saves his 
   squadron from a rebel attack. He does his job so well, in fact, that 
   the rebels order his assassination and several unsuccessful attempts 
   are made on his life. A cease fire is eventually agreed to between 
   both sides, but a militant faction of the rebels stir up the shit and 
   play both sides off each other, which forces a violent showdown 
   between the rebels and the military (children are killed in front of 
   Basaron's eyes). Can Basaron put an end to the madness and head back 
   home, where he can question his father about the meaning of peace? 
   What do you think?&nbsp; This is a slow-moving and less-than-satisfying
    action flick, directed by Francis 'Jun' Posadas (<B><A HREF="action.htm#WildCatsAttack">WILD
    CATS ATTACK</A></B> - 1981; <B><A HREF="action.htm#WildForce1986">WILD
    FORCE</A></B> - 1986) and scripted by Conrad Galang. While the film 
   does have its share of action set-pieces, they lack the insane 
   spontaneity we come to expect from Filipino actioners (even the 
   English dubbing lacks the humorous dialogue we depend on to get us 
   through the slow spots). <B>BLOOD WAR</B> seems more concerned with 
   Basaron's internal moral struggle than conflict on the battlefield 
   and while I'm sure this plays well in it's home country, it loses a 
   lot in the translation when played abroad. It's just as preachy as <B><A HREF="#KrisCommando">KRIS
    COMMANDO</A></B> (1987) when it comes to Muslim vs. Christianity 
   beliefs, but lacks the bloody violence we get to see in <B>KRIS</B>. 
   While <B>BLOOD WAR</B> has lots of gunfights, most of the bullet 
   squibs are confined to the ground and other inanimate objects. Here, 
   when people get shot, they grab their chest or heads and we never get 
   to see any carnage whatsoever. Major plot points are also dropped or 
   forgotten (What happened to Narsheva and Bashir? We never find out.) 
   and the film meanders along at a snail's pace, lumping one internal 
   conflict onto another without a satisfactory conclusion to any of 
   them. While the film ends on an uplifting and Muslim-loving note, 
   it's just too damned earnest and well-meaning for it's own good. This 
   is strictly lower-tier Filipino action that can be skipped by all 
   those except diehard fans that must see every available 
   Philippines-made action flick (A category I'm afraid I fall too 
   easily into!). Also starring Joonee Gamboa, Ernie Ortega, Robert Lee,

    BORN LOSERS</A><A NAME="Born Losers"></A> (1967) - </B>I was just 
   thinking how lucky I was growing up in the 60's &amp; 70's. Billy 
   Jack was the first modern action hero to grace the silver screen, 
   paving the way for your Seagals, Van Dammes, Lundgrens and other 
   B-movie action stars. Tom Laughlin's Billy Jack is the American 
   equivilent of Bruce Lee: the strong silent type not afraid to stand 
   up to injustice. The difference with the Billy Jack films, though, is 
   that they were more interested in the politics than action, or should 
   I say, the absurdities of politics. The Billy Jack films preached 
   peace and equality, but didn't have a problem wallowing in the dirt 
   and degradation that it so preached against. <B><A HREF="born_losers_1967d.htm">THE
    BORN LOSERS</A></B> began the Billy Jack mythos, but it wasn't until 
   the second film, titled simply <B><A HREF="billy_jack_1971.htm">BILLY JACK</A></B>,
    that the character took off and orbited in a world all it's own. 
   It's a shame, because <B><A HREF="born_losers_1967e.htm">THE BORN LOSERS</A></B> 
   is an all-around better film and seems less dated than the second 
   film, made four years later. The film opens up with a biker gang 
   beating the bejesus out of a wise-mouth motorist (to be fair, he 
   really was <A HREF="born_losers_1967.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/born losers dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>asking
    for it). Billy Jack (Laughlin) steps in and shoots one of the bikers 
   in the hand when he comes at him with a broken bottle. The police 
   arrive and arrest everyone. When Billy Jack stands before the judge, 
   he finds out that his punishment (a $1,000 fine) is much greater than 
   the bikers' (a $135 fine). That is the first injustice. The bikers 
   rape five girls, including college student Vicky (the lovely 
   Elizabeth James, who also wrote the screenplay using the name &quot;E.
    James Lloyd&quot;), and everyone is scared to testify against the 
   bikers, except Vicky. She identifies her assailants and one of them 
   is the brother of biker leader Danny (Jeremy Slate, who gives an 
   excellent multi-layered performance). He decides the best way to get 
   his brother out of jail is to make sure Vicky never makes it to court 
   to testify. This is the second injustice. Vicky gets police 
   protection, but that proves to be highly ineffective (the police are 
   portrayed as sincere, but handcuffed by laws that protect the 
   criminals more than they do the victims). Enter Billy Jack. He sees 
   Vicky being kidnapped by the bikers and steps in, beating the crap 
   out of three bikers with martial arts he learned as a Green Beret. 
   Billy brings Vicky to his trailer home (overlooking the Pacific 
   Ocean) where she learns some important life lessons about life, love 
   and what it means to have convictions. When the bikers break into 
   Billy's trailer, ransack it and steal all the money he has, he says 
   enough is enough. This is the third, and final, injustice. Be we all 
   know justice without law come with a price. Directed by Laughlin 
   using his &quot;T.C. Frank&quot; pseudonym, <B><A HREF="born_losers_1967b.htm">THE
    BORN LOSERS</A></B> is a pretty damn good piece of 60's exploitation 
   with some political aspirations. Billy Jack is just one colorful 
   character in a film full of colorful characters and he takes a 
   backseat until the final third of the film. Along the way, we learn 
   that Danny and his brother have an abusive father, the town deputy 
   (future director Jack Starrett) likes to take the law into his own 
   hands every now and then and a lot of laws (including punishment for 
   rape) have mostly gone unchanged for the past 40 years. Although some 
   of the dialogue is dated (Vicky postpones her rape by saying, &quot;If
    rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.&quot; and then asking the 
   bikers if they have any acid), the film is still as relevant today as 
   it was back in 1967. The bikers are not portrayed as raving lunatics 
   as with most 60's exploitation biker films. They have dimensions, 
   even if they do commit heinous acts. Danny has a wife and a small son 
   and we see him play with the boy like a doting dad in one scene. Some 
   great character actors portray members of the biker gang, including 
   William Wellman Jr., Robert Tessier and Jeff Cooper. Also starring 
   Stuart Lancaster (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Godmonster">GODMONSTER

    IN WAR</A><A NAME="BrothersInWar"></A> (1988) -</B> Interesting 
   Italian financed, Philippines-lensed Vietnam War actioner. The film 
   opens on some unnamed beachside U.S. military base, where a 
   minimalist USO-like tour, which consists solely of a young woman 
   named Mary (Sherri Rose; <B><A HREF="#InGoldWeTrust">IN GOLD WE TRUST</A></B> 
   - 1990) and her manager Burt (James Pelish), put on a show where Mary 
   strips while singing a bastardized version of &quot;Hey, Big 
   Spender!&quot; on an even more naked stage. Suddenly, the base comes 
   under enemy attack and many soldiers are killed. The base captain 
   assigns soldiers Stereo (Christopher Alan; <B><A HREF="karate_warrior_sequels_1988-1993.htm">KARATE
    WARRIOR 2</A></B> - 1988) and Josy (Victor Rivers), who are not 
   exactly the best of friends (Josy keeps calling Stereo 
   &quot;faggot&quot;, probably because he prances around in a pair of 
   tight cut-off shorts), to drive Burt and Mary back to safety, which 
   means traversing over forty miles of enemy territory in nothing but a 
   Jeep. Almost immediately, they come under enemy fire and lose the 
   Jeep, forcing them to make it<A HREF="brothers_in_war_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/brothers in war italian dvd front small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the rest of the way on foot. After discovering that they have been 
   traveling around in circles, Josy, who is a really sadistic and 
   violent piece of work (not only is he a brutal jerk, he's a 
   misogynist to boot), appoints himself as the leader of the quartet 
   and tries to rape Mary later that night, but is stopped by Stereo 
   (who we find out is really named John). Josy eventually does rape 
   Mary when Stereo and Burt fall into a tiger trap during a raging 
   thunderstorm and when they finally free themselves, Josy has 
   abandoned them and the quartet is now a trio. They continue on their 
   journey to safety, stealing a boat containing a bunch on VC corpses 
   and heading down river. Burt is killed when the boat is attacked by a 
   VC family pretending to offer them food and Stereo and Mary are 
   captured by the VC and put in bamboo cages suspended in the river. 
   Stereo tries to keep Mary distracted from the screams of other 
   prisoners being tortured by singing &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; (!) and 
   they eventually screw each other by fucking between the bamboo bars 
   (!!), finally erasing any doubts in the viewers' minds of Stereo 
   actually being a faggot. Mary is then raped by her VC captors and we 
   then discover that Josy is also a prisoner there. When Stereo and 
   Mary finally escape, he has to make a decision whether or not to save 
   Josy. Stereo makes the right decision and saves Josy, only to have 
   Josy sacrifice his own life so Stereo and Mary can escape. Stereo and 
   Mary then try to catch a train to safety, but run smack-dab into a 
   gunfight between a private army and the VC. Will they survive?&nbsp;

   Italian-made war actioners, <B><A HREF="brothers_in_war_1988c.htm">BROTHERS

   Parker Jr.&quot;, is still an interesting film thanks to it's 
   unrelenting tone. Though horribly dubbed in English, this film still 
   manages to get the point across that war is hell, and sometimes the 
   enemy is as close as the person fighting alongside you. Josy is a 
   complete irredeemable douchebag and, even when he sacrifices himself 
   at the end of the film, he tells Stereo (who comes back to rescue him 
   a second time) that, if the roles were reversed, he would have let 
   Stereo rot in the torture camp. While there is violence on view here, 
   my favorite parts of the film are the little details, such as when 
   Burt falls into the river and tries to pull himself into a boat by 
   grabbing the arm of a VC corpse, only to discover that the corpse's 
   arm has been blown off, or the opening shot of a frogman silently 
   coming to shore under the cover of darkness and then the lights to 
   the miniskirted Mary's show suddenly comes on, revealing a beach full 
   of horny soldiers. This is not going to be on every action fan's 
   must-see list, but <B>BROTHERS IN WAR</B> is just different enough to 
   merit a look-see. Also starring Ana Silvia Gruyllon, Carles Irving, 
   Thomas Rack, Victor Pujols and Jose Reies. This Fulvia Film

    -</B> Gary Busey stars as Detective Frank McBain, who is nicknamed 
   &quot;Bulletproof&quot; because he gets shot during every bust 
   (usually because he is just plain reckless), but always survives. The 
   film opens with McBain and partner Billy Dunbar (Thalmus Rasulala; <B><A HREF="#Mr.Ricco">MR.
    RICCO</A></B> - 1975) stopping a major weapons transaction between 
   buyer Sharkey (a nattily dressed Danny Trejo) and seller Montoya (Don 
   Pike, also the film's Stunt Coordinator), who delivers the weapons in 
   an ice cream truck. After a shootout (When Sharkey spots McBain, he 
   shouts, &quot;Who the fuck is that?&quot;, to which McBain replies, 
   &quot;Your worst nightmare, butt-whore!&quot;), McBain and Dunbar get 
   into a car chase with Sharkey and Montoya, who is driving the ice 
   cream truck, McBain blowing it up with a well placed (and 
   logistically impossible) grenade toss. Of course, McBain takes a 
   bullet in the shoulder and removes it by himself with a pair of 
   tweezers when he gets home, placing it in a glass jar with all the 
   other close calls. We then switch to a bunch of nasty Mexican rebels, 
   led by Pantaro (Juan Fernandez; <B><A HREF="kinjite_forbidden_subjects_1989.htm">KINJITE:

   - 1988) hostage after killing everyone else, bringing them and the 
   tank to a small Mexican village ruled by evil Arab (!) Colonel 
   Kartiff (Henry Silva; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CryOfAProstitute">CRY 
   OF A PROSTITUTE</A></B> - 1974). The U.S. government, in the 
   personage of General Blackburn (R.G. Armstrong; <B><A HREF="#TrapperCountyWar">TRAPPER
    COUNTY WAR</A></B> - 1989), puts McBain back into military service 
   (he use to be a an undercover military operative, until he 
   accidentally shot and killed his partner in a bust gone bad) and 
   tells him to retrieve the Thunderblast and save any hostages. Since 
   Devon was his dead partner's fianc&eacute;e (and his secret lover), 
   McBain accepts the assignment and heads off to Mexico. While Colonel 
   Kartiff tries to figure out a way to breach the tank's security 
   system (it delivers a lethal jolt of electricity to anyone who tries 
   to enter it without punching in the correct code), McBain begins his 
   trek to the Mexican village and encounters resistance at every turn. 
   When it turns out that this whole scenario was a set-up to get McBain 
   into a face-off with an old Russian nemesis (William Smith; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EvilAltar">EVIL
    ALTAR</A></B> - 1987), who was responsible for McBain accidentally 
   killing his partner years earlier, McBain and Devon jump into the 
   Thunderblast for some good-old American payback.&nbsp; The first 
   thing you'll notice about this film is the tremendous amount of 
   excellent character actors in the cast. Besides the ones already 
   mentioned, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Rene Enriguez, Lincoln 
   Kirkpatrick and Lydie Denier round out the roster. Director Steve 
   Carver (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BigBadMama">BIG BAD MAMA</A></B>

    WOLF MCQUADE</A></B> - 1983) manages to even pull a good performance 
   from the usually manic Gary Busey (<B><A HREF="eye_of_the_tiger_1986.htm">EYE
    OF THE TIGER</A></B> - 1986), who spouts some very funny dialogue 
   (he likes to preface all his personal insults with the word 
   &quot;butt&quot;), thanks to a screenplay supplied by T.L. Lankford 
   and B.J. Goldman (Fred Olen Ray is given a co-story credit as well as 
   an Associate Producer credit). Carver is best, though, handling the 
   action scenes, as lots of objects explode, people are riddled with 
   bullets and there's a ridiculously funny scene of McBain escaping on 
   a giant wooden spool (which he is tied spread-eagle to) after Devon 
   tosses a grenade behind it, forcing it to roll down a hill! Henry 
   Silva is his regular bug-eyed, sweaty self (some of his expressions 
   are priceless) and he even gets to rape Darlanne Fluegel. While not a 
   great action film, <B><A HREF="bulletproof_1987b.htm">BULLETPROOF</A></B> 
   is a thoroughly entertaining B-movie that could only come from the 
   politically incorrect 80's. I'm still trying to figure out why the 
   terrorists in Mexico are a mixture of Mexicans, Muslims and Russians. 
   This isn't a sequel to <B><A HREF="red_dawn_1984.htm">RED DAWN</A></B>

   (1990) -</B> Rip-roaring action flick. Charter pilot Chuck Taylor 
   (Miles O'Keeffe) is set-up when a delivery of what he thinks is 
   medical supplies turns out to be a huge shipment of &quot;Peruvian 
   Flake&quot;. Drug kingpin Tony King (Don Stroud) orders his men to 
   retrieve the cocaine and kill Taylor, but when the DEA and FBI show 
   up at the airport, both Taylor and King are arrested and sent to the 
   same prison to serve their sentences. It's apparent that there's no 
   love lost between the two and when Taylor interferes with King's 
   prison drug ring (as well as beating King at an arm wrestling match), 
   King orders his men on the outside to kill Taylor's family and 
   girlfriend. When King's goons, including right-hand man Rivera 
   (Gregory Scott Cummins), drive a car through Taylor's house, rape and 
   kill his sister Nancy (Suzee Slater) and shoot and injure both 
   Nancy's young son Tommy (Bradley Pierce) and Taylor's girlfriend 
   Donna (Crystal Carson), a distraught and revenge-minded Taylor must 
   find a way to break out of prison. Things get worse when Rivera pulls 
   a daring daytime prison breakout, with the help of crooked prison 
   guard <A HREF="cartel_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cartel vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Mason
    (William Smith), which results in King escaping and making it look 
   like he died in the attempt. After hearing from Donna that his court 
   appeal is probably not going to happen, Taylor escapes from prison 
   (using the old standby: a metal file!) and begins his systematic 
   destruction of all things Tony King. Using information gathered by 
   Donna, Taylor intercepts a drug shipment in a parking garage (He 
   says, &quot;Have a nice flight!&quot; to a goon just before he throws 
   him off the garage roof), but Rivera kidnaps Donna, forcing Taylor to 
   attempt to save her in a boxing gym. After rescuing Donna, Taylor 
   returns to prison (!) and, the next day, he's freed when new evidence 
   (which he anonomously provided to authorities during his night of 
   freedom) comes to light. King then kidnaps Taylor and Donna and puts 
   them on a boat with a ticking timebomb. In the finale, Taylor breaks 
   free and brings King to justice (if death is actually justice) and 
   discovers that he had an unlikely ally at his back the entire 
   time.&nbsp; All low-budget action films should be this entertaining. 
   No one ever accused Miles O'Keeffe (<B><A HREF="#PhantomRaiders">PHANTOM
    RAIDERS</A></B> - 1988) of being much of an actor, but he's quite 
   good here as a man determined to get even. I would go as far as to 
   say that this is his best role ever. O'Keeffe doesn't have to emote 
   much but, when he does, he's believable. There are also many 
   well-done action set pieces and stunts, including multiple car chases 
   and crashes, plane stunts, gun fights and hand-to-hand combat. The 
   attack on Taylor's house, where Nancy is raped and killed, is a high 
   point. You're not sure what's going to happen and, for a short time, 
   you're led to believe that little Tommy is killed. Very unusual for 
   an American-made action film from this time period. Don Stroud is, 
   well, Don Stroud, as he acts crazy, kills anyone who gets in his way 
   and overacts enormously. This was one of the last films he made 
   before he was viciously mugged and knifed in real life, which 
   resulted in him losing an eye and his face being partially paralyzed 
   on one side (See 1991's <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Divine Enforcer">THE 
   DIVINE ENFORCER</A></B> to view the damage to his face). He proved to 
   be a real trouper and used his facial deformity to good effect in 
   many of his later roles (He is now retired in Hawaii). Director John 
   Stewart (<B><A HREF="#ActionUSA">ACTION U.S.A.</A></B> - 1988; <B><A HREF="click_calendar_girl_killer_1990.htm">CLICK:
    THE CALENDAR GIRL KILLER</A></B> - 1991) does a good job maintaining 
   the viewer's interest and the script, by Moshe Hadar, keeps things 
   moving at a brisk pace, tossing in so many action scenes you almost 
   forget some of the film's gaping plot holes (the whole time frame of 
   the film just doesn't add up, especially after Taylor escapes from 
   prison). <B><A HREF="cartel_1990b.htm">CARTEL</A></B> is still one of

   it as the end of Tatum O'Neal and Irene Cara's acting careers. I 
   prefer to take the second route: A pretty good and bloody film that 
   contains two Academy Award-winning actresses who probably took the 
   jobs to pay some bills. Tatum and Irene portray Scarlet and Tracy, 
   who first meet in court where they are both about to be taken before

   Tracy) charges. When two other <A HREF="certain_fury_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/certain fury vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>female
    cons slit a bailiff's throat and take his gun and begin shooting up 
   the courtroom (killing 7 people), Scarlet and Tracy run for their 
   lives and are mistaken as a part of the gang who killed the cops and 
   innocent bystanders. The cops shoot one of the guilty women in the 
   head and then shotgun her in the chest, the other guilty girl is 
   pulled down on a spiked fence by the cops and is impaled. Tracy and 
   Scarlet escape into the sewers, where one stupid cop, who has them 
   cornered, lights up a cigarette and ignites the sewer gas, causing a 
   massive explosion and his eventual death. A detective (George 
   Murdock) and Tracy's father (the late Moses Gunn) try to find the 
   pair (they both know that the girls are innocent, even if Murdock 
   refuses to say it out loud), before the cops kill them both. Scarlet 
   (who is illiterate) and Tracy are always bickering (Scarlet calls 
   Tracy a &quot;nigger bitch&quot;) but circumstances keep them 
   together. Scarlet takes Tracy to her drug supplier Sniffer (Nicholas 
   Campbell) in hopes of getting help, but he just wants them out of his 
   apartment. Scarlet leaves while Tracy takes a much-needed shower. 
   Scarlet goes to see Rodney (Peter Fonda, in what amounts to a cameo) 
   to see if he can help her, but he turns her away. Meanwhile, Sniffer 
   tries to rape Tracy in the shower and she beats the holy hell out of 
   him. Scarlet comes back and steals Sniffer's cocaine stash in hopes 
   of getting some cash. Rodney, after finding out that there's a reward 
   for the capture of the girls, sends three of his goons to Sniffer's 
   apartment. A bloody gunfight ensues, where Sniffer snuffs one of the 
   goons with a shotgun as the two girls escape yet again. Scarlet takes 
   the stolen stash to Superman (Rodney Gage), where he agrees to buy it 
   for $1,000. More trouble begins as Rodney's two remaining goons and 
   Sniffer follow them to Superman's lair. The goons set the place on 
   fire, hoping to flush out the girls, while Sniffer begins to beat the 
   crap out of Scarlet. Sniffer burns to death and the girls escape yet 
   again. Hearing that they are considered dead in the fire (a false

   the gaping plot holes that are left unresolved at the film's end. 
   Filled with bloody shootouts, explosions, needle-stabbings and other 
   mayhem, this action film differs from most because it doesn't contain 
   one single car chase. Both Tatum O'Neal and Irene Cara (who sings the 
   title track) do a decent job with their roles. They never really bond 
   as friends until the finale which gives this film a thumbs-up from me

   Another outrageous actioner as only the Filipinos can make them. 
   After a successful raid on a jungle hideout where Ramon (Rey Malonzo 
   starring as &quot;Raymond Malonzo&quot;) and his Army cohorts save 
   women hostages and kill all the guerillas (including Ramon's amazing 
   acrobatic backflip off the side of a cliff where he shoots the head 
   guerilla square in the face while in midair!), Ramon is called to be 
   by his mother's side in the hospital. Before she dies, she makes 
   Ramon promise to quit the Army. Torn about his <A HREF="classified_operation_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/classified operation greek vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="177" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>promise,
    Ramon decides to take his wife and son on a vacation to visit his 
   old hometown and his Uncle Jose. As soon as they get into town, Ramon 
   gets into a fight with a bunch of street thugs, simply for asking 
   directions. Ramon soon discovers that his old hometown is now under 
   the strict rule of Cmdr. Falcon (George Estregan as &quot;George St. 
   Reagan&quot;). Every family must pay their &quot;taxes&quot; (which 
   include their virgin daughters for sale to the slave trade) to 
   Falcon. If they don't, the men will be beat-up (or killed) and the 
   women raped. It's not long before Ramon is knee-deep in shit as the 
   police chief is too scared of Falcon to be any help. Ramon takes on 
   Falcon and his gang single-handedly and suffers a great personal 
   tragedy in the process.&nbsp; Shamed into action (by Ramon's son), 
   the police chief and the town spring into action to save Ramon (who 
   for some reason is now called &quot;Cmdr. .45&quot;). Viewed as a 
   companion piece to 1984's <B><A HREF="#Search Vengeance">SEARCH FOR VENGEANCE</A></B> 
   (which was also directed, like this one, by star Rey Malonzo using 
   the pseudonym &quot;Reginald King&quot;), <B>CLASSIFIED OPERATION</B> 
   is the weaker of the two, but not without it's charms. Besides the 
   already-mentioned cliff stunt, there's also an hilarious scene where 
   Ramon shows his quickdraw skills on a gang of gun-toting goons. The 
   incidental dialogue (by screenwriter Arthur Simon) is also a hoot. 
   When a gang of guerillas is walking through the jungle, one can be 
   heard saying, &quot;I killed four men today.&quot;, like it was a 
   normal thing for him. When Falcon is interrupted while fooling around 
   with two women, he turns to them and says, &quot;Keep it hot while 
   I'm gone. OK?&quot; There's also plenty of hand-to-hand combat (with 
   exaggerated sound effects), numerous gun battles (Ramon likes to 
   shoot people in the face for some reason) and too many explosions to 
   count. Hey, this isn't Shakespeare, but it sure as hell isn't boring. 
   Try not to smile as Ramon does the final barrel-roll stunt with the 
   succession of .45s lying on the ground.&nbsp; Also starring Mariane

   multiple exploding bodies, throat slittings, knifings and plenty of 
   bloody bullet squibs. The action set-pieces are well choreographed, 
   as the gun battles are brutal and the explosions immense. What more 
   could you ask for? This is a winner in my book because it has no

   THE SUN GOD</A></B> - 1983) and right hand woman Maria (Cristina 
   Donadio), along with some Rebel freedom fighters, blow up a dam, 
   destroying a bridge (great miniature effects) that is used by new 
   dictator Hormoza (Subas Herrero; Margheriti's <B><A HREF="indio_1989.htm">INDIO</A></B> 
   - 1989) to transport precious fuel to his army. The Rebels want 
   Hormoza dethroned and their country free from tyranny, especially 
   from under Hormoza's cruel thumb, including Hormoza's 
   second-in-command, the extremely evil Silviera (Klaus Kinski; 
   Margheriti's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WebSpider1971">WEB OF THE SPIDER</A></B> 
   - 1971), who would rather shoot Rebels than look at them. During the 
   destruction of the dam, there is a firefight and some of the Rebels 
   are injured (including a dam employee who was working with Carrasco), 
   so Carrasco, Smithy and Maria take them to the nearest village to get 
   them some medical attention.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The village is not happy to see Carrasco and the Rebels; they have 
   no medical facility and they don't want Hormoza to send his army 
   there for cooperating with the Rebels, but it's too late. The village 
   is attacked by three helicopters, commandeered by Silviera. The 
   helicopters are equipped with flame throwers (something I have never 
   seen before, but, damn, Margheriti's miniature effects work is very 
   believable here!), which burn down the village, Silviera and his men 
   then exit the helicopters and kill every villager they come in 
   contact with, ruthlessly gunning them down, even though none of them 
   have weapons. Carrasco, Smithy and Maria fight back and blow up one 
   of the helicopters (a Margheriti trademark), forcing Silviera to 
   escape by the skin of his teeth. Corrasco tells Maria to take all the 
   injured to the nearest medical facility, a makeshift hospital in a 
   church run by Father Julio (Manfred Lehmann; <B><A HREF="casablanca_express_1989.htm">CASABLANCA

   (Michael James; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Rescue Team">RESCUE TEAM</A></B>

   Hormoza'a army attacking the church, but he is overruled by Father

    Carrasco and Smithy get intel that Hormoza has quickly built a 
   pontoon bridge across the river, replacing the one they destroyed, so 
   they don scuba gear and place explosive charges under the bridge, 
   while trucks containing fuel are traveling across it. Smithy doesn't 
   get out of the water in time and is knocked unconscious by the shock 
   waves of explosions and is captured by the enemy. The destruction of 
   the pontoon bridge is successful and Carrasco is almost killed by the 
   enemy, but is saved by a small band of Rebels headed by an unnamed 
   man who was a good friend of Carrasco's dead father (Played by 
   Luciano Pigozzi, better known as &quot;Alan Collins&quot;; 
   Margheriti's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NakedYouDie">NAKED YOU DIE</A></B>

   90% of Margheriti's films, including all of his '80s actioners.). 
   Carrasco&nbsp; and his new miniature army head to the makeshift 
   hospital, not knowing that Silviera and his men are already there, 
   killing some of the wounded by shooting them point blank, including 
   the dam worker, whom Silviera calls a &quot;traitor&quot; and pumps 
   three bullets in his chest. Maria is also wounded in the fracas when 
   she tries to stop the unnecessary killing and when Silviera burns 
   down the church, killing everyone inside (including Father Miguel), 
   Carrasco and his small band of freedom fighters appear, forcing 
   Silviera once again to retreat.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Carrasco decides to rescue his good friend Smithy, not knowing he 
   has escaped with the help of a small number of P.O.W.s. They show up 
   at the destroyed church, where Smithy tells Carrasco that he has 
   learned that Hormoza is traveling alone by plane, without his 
   bodyguards at a nearby airport, for a secret visit. Carrasco, along 
   with Smithy and the P.O.W.s, sneak into the airport with a rocket 
   launcher&nbsp; to blow up Hormoza's plane as it lands, but something 
   smells fishy to Carrasco. Turns out he was right, as someone else 
   blows up the plane as it lands (another good miniature effect) with 
   another rocket launcher. It turns out the P.O.W.s were working with 
   Silviera to set-up Carrasco, as the plane doesn't contain Hormoza at 
   all, it contains over a hundred young orphan children! Carrasco kills 
   the P.O.W.s as they try to escape and when Smithy realizes he has 
   been duped, he is shot in the back and killed before he can apologize 
   to Carrasco. It was Silviera who shot down the plane, but Carrasco 
   will get the blame, especially when Silviera has helicopters dump 
   thousands of flyers by helicopter blaming Carrasco for the death of 
   the orphan children. When Carrasco tries to escape from the airport, 
   he is seriously wounded, but he is saved once again but his dead 
   father's friend. The unnamed man also has his small band collect all 
   the flyers so the villagers don't turn against Carrasco.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Father Julio takes all of the wounded, as well as the displaced 
   villagers, to an abandoned monastery in the mountains, but before 
   they get there, one of the busses drives into the middle of a 
   minefield and explodes. The villagers run out of the bus, some of 
   them stepping on land mines and blowing up, as Silviera, using 
   binoculars, laughs as he watches them die, in the film's most tense 
   and graphic sequence. Father Julio saves as many of them as he can, 
   having them climb on the bus he is driving. The film concludes with 
   Hormoza leaving the country in disgrace, after Carrasco and Father 
   Julio blow up a fuel train that is passing by an oil refinery, which 
   also explodes (more of Margheriti's excellent miniature work). 
   Without fuel, Hormoza knows he stands no chance of winning the war, 
   so he quickly leaves the country, which results in most of his 
   soldiers taking the side of the Rebels, even shaking their hands, 
   since most of them never agreed with Hormoza's brutal ways. But there 
   is still a small band of soldiers who still side with Silviera and 
   they attack the monestary, not knowing that the dictator's army are 
   now on the side of the Rebels. It's a quick, bloody victory for the 
   Rebels and when Silviera discovers this, he tries to escape the 
   monestary, but he is cornered&nbsp; by the villagers, the Rebels and 
   the repatriated soldiers, who surround Silviera. Rather than shoot 
   Silviera dead, they tear him apart with their bare hands. Carrasco 
   tries to stop them, saying the time for violence is over, but he is 
   too late, Silviera is dead. Father Julio is also mortally wounded 
   (after picking up a rifle and acdentally shooting one of Silviera's 
   men, who was about to kill Maria. The look <A HREF="commando_leopard_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/commando leopard german dvd front small2a.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>on
    his face after doing this tells us he wishes he was dead and his 
   wish is granted,) and dies in Maria's arms. The film ends with 
   Carrasco picking up Father Julio, cradling his dead body in his arms, 
   and walking away into the sunset, while a gospel tune plays on the 
   soundtrack, telling everyone &quot;We All Have To Die Sometime.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is a rip-roaring action flick with a weird religious subtext, 
   but it is not shoved in your face like some religious war films do, 
   it is subtle. Antonio Margheriti made some damn good war action films 
   during the '80s, including his &quot;Vietnam Trilogy&quot; of <B><A HREF="#LastHunter1980">THE

   Kinski), and <B><A HREF="commander_1988.htm">THE COMMANDER</A></B> 
   (1988; also starring Collins and Manfred Lehmann). This film ranks 
   with the best of them, thanks to the non-stop action and Margheriti's 
   excellent miniature effects, the show-stopper being the destruction 
   of a train carrying full tankers of fuel. As it explodes tanker-by-tanker,
    it also destroys the oil refinery the train is slowly passing, which 
   is the impetus for Hormoza leaving the country, because the refinery 
   was needed if he had any hope of defeating the Rebels. It's a 
   fantastic display of explosions, which will get your heart pumping, 
   as Carrasco and Father Julio try to escape before their train car 
   explodes.&nbsp; Margheriti's son, Edoardo (who has a small role in 
   this film), has said his father's favorite thing to do, besides 
   directing, was creating miniature effects and this film showcases 
   them in fine detail. If you like war films with plenty of action and

   don't care what the fuck happens to him. Luckily for Fulci, he crams 
   enough graphic violence into this film to allow you to overlook 
   Testi's tepid performance. I know this is saying a lot, but this may 
   be Fulci's most violent film of his career. When this film ended, my 
   jaw was on the floor. Fulci shies away from nothing, making this a 
   Eurocrime film that every fan of the genre should see.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    As I said before, Luca Di Angelo is a member of a criminal 
   organization that smuggles booze and cigarettes by motorboat up and 
   down the Naples coastline. The problem is, some unknown person is 
   smuggling hard drugs in Luca's territory and that's where he draws 
   the line. He has a young son in school and is fully aware that his 
   son and his friends could become hooked on drugs because schools are 
   the first place dealers hit in a new territory. Hook the kids and 
   business booms. Luca and his brother Mickey (Enrico Maisto; <B><A HREF="violent_naples_1976.htm">VIOLENT
    NAPLES</A></B> - 1976) are very vocal about it, not caring who hears 
   it. One day, Luca and Mickey are stopped at a police roadblock, only 
   they are not the police at all, they are thugs dressed as police. 
   While Luca hides in the car, Mickey is machine-gunned to death, 
   sending his body down an embankment full of used car tires to the 
   ocean below (a very good stunt). When Luca gets out of the car and 
   discovers his brother's dead body floating in the ocean, he has a 
   look on his face as if he is about to fall asleep (!), but he vows 
   revenge anyway. Thinking that the head of his rival organization, 
   Scherino (Ferdinando Murolo; the &quot;Farancksalan&quot;/Frankenstein
    Monster in <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#AssignmentTerror69">ASSIGNMENT
    TERROR</A></B> - 1969), is involved, Luca kills one of Scherino's 
   men and tosses his body through Scherino's bedroom window, but 
   Scherino is able to convince Luca that he had nothing to do with 
   Mickey's death. Still, Scherino has his men beat up Luca within an 
   inch of his life, to teach him an important lesson. Luca's boss, 
   Luigi Perlante (Saverio Marconi; <B><A HREF="go_gorilla_go_1975.htm">GO,
    GORILLA, GO</A></B> - 1975), tells Luca that Frenchman Francois 
   Jacois (Marcel Bozzuffi; <B><A HREF="stunt_squad_1977.htm">STUNT SQUAD</A></B> 
   - 1977), a.k.a. &quot;The Marsigliese&quot;, is the guilty party, 
   bringing hard drugs to Naples and killing his brother. The 
   Marsigliese is somewhat of a dandy, wearing a custom 
   &quot;perfume&quot; made just for himself (it becomes an important 
   plot point).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   what he doesn't realize is that The Marsigliese is even more brutal 
   and vicious, setting the face of a female drug courier named 
   Ingrid&nbsp; (Ofelia Meyer; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#RingDarkness77/79">RING

   violent sequence, as we see a machinegun blast open a man's head, a 
   gun being shoved in another man's mouth and blowing his brains out 
   the back of his head and other gory mayhem. Perlante barely escapes 
   with his life when he makes his openly gay right hand man Alfredo

   forces Luca to agree to an unfair split in the drug profits for the 
   safe return of his son, but once again, Luca ignores his family's 
   safety and does things his own way, ending The Marsigliese's reign of 
   terror once and for all. To symbolize the Marsigliese's worth as a 
   human being, his dead body falls and rests on a garbage can. Even the

    I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with this film when 
   it first came on, mainly for Fabio Testi's awful performance, but the 
   film became more and more violent as it progressed, so I basically 
   ignored Testi's performance (hard, but not impossible) and sat agape 
   at the graphic violence on view. This would have been considered one 
   of Fulci's best films if not for Testi's performance, so I will call 
   it an interesting failure. An entertaining interesting failure. There 
   are some nice filmic compositions on view, especially Mickey's 
   funeral procession by motorboat and the way Don Morrone gets his 
   revenge., but I can't really get my mind off Testi's deliberate, 
   awful performance. It ruins an otherwise excellent film (I guess his 
   performance is difficult to overlook). <A HREF="contraband_1980.htm#OST">Fabio

    watching his wife and child getting brutally murdered in a home 
   invasion, Richard Straker (Richard Norton) kills the invaders and 
   becomes a drunken bum. One year later, the government asks him to 
   return to Laos (during the war, he headed a Special Forces called 
   &quot;Black Thunder&quot;) to search for possible M.I.A.s and 
   P.O.W.s. Major Straker travels to Bangkok and immediately gets into a 
   bar fight (a prerequisite in films like this) and saves the life of a 
   whore (who he fucks back at his hotel). Straker learns from C.I.A. 
   operative Major Fowler (Frank Schuller) that he is bringing six 
   wet-behind-the-ears soldiers on this mission and the government will 
   disavow all knowledge of this mission if they are caught or killed. 
   Straker and his new men parachute behind enemy lines and recon with 
   their VC guides.<A HREF="cross_fire_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cross fire vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="233" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   They come across a burned-out village which turns out to be 
   boobytrapped and one of Straker's men is injured. It seems no matter 
   where they go, the enemy is waiting for them in ambush and, 
   eventually, one member is shot dead. The head guide leads them to 
   Hogan, &quot;The Australian&quot; (Glen Ruehland), an ex-patriate 
   black marketeer who feeds Straker's men worms for dinner and then 
   drives them to the border in a beat-up old schoolbus during the 
   middle of the night. Hogan turns out to be a traitor and Straker and 
   his men are captured and driven to a prison camp, headed by Dihn 
   (Franco Guerrero of <B><A HREF="#OneArmedExecutioner">ONE ARMED EXECUTIONER</A></B> 
   - 1980), where the men are tied up and Dihn beats up Straker and then 
   raosts him over some flaming embers. When morning comes, it's 
   apparent that other American P.O.W.s are being kept there, including 
   members of Straker's old Black Thunder squad. Straker and his men 
   break free and rescue the P.O.W.s, only to find out that they're all 
   infected with leprosy! Straker still rescues the P.O.W.s, completely 
   destroys the camp and head towards the extraction point. Straker 
   steals a train and then a jeep, only to learn his mission was a sham. 
   After losing most of his men (and all the P.O.W.s!), Straker is not 
   about to take this whole fiasco lying down.&nbsp; This 
   Philippines-lensed war action film, directed/produced/co-scripted by 
   frequent Cirio H. Santiago collaborator Anthony Maharaj (<B><A HREF="mission_terminate_1987.htm">MISSION
    TERMINATE</A></B> - 1987), is standard jungle war thrills. It's 
   basically a low-budget rip-off of <B><A HREF="rambo_first_blood_2_1985.htm">RAMBO:
    FIRST BLOOD PART II</A></B> (1985), as Straker and his inexperienced 
   men trek through the jungle, get into firefights and try to avoid 
   boobytraps while searching for living M.I.A.s &amp; P.O.W.s. The real 
   action doesn't kick in until the one hour mark, but once it starts, 
   it's non-stop gunfights, hand-to-hand combat and explosions. I must 
   admit that the leprosy angle was a nice, unexpected touch as were 
   some later scenes, especially when Hogan, who turns out to be a good 
   guy afterall, says to one of Straker's men when he doesn't want to 
   touch the leprosy-infected P.O.W.s: &quot;You Americans suffer from a 
   worse disease, A.I.D.S.: Acute Ignorance Dumb Shit!&quot; While the

   as <B><A HREF="not_another_mistake_1987.htm">NOT ANOTHER MISTAKE</A></B>

   in numerous B action films during the 80's &amp; 90's, but he never 
   got the proper recognition he deserved. I believe his Australian 
   accent has handcuffed him in the United States, but that's a shame 
   because he's a much better actor than most American B action stars. 
   His refusal to Americanize his accent (like Mel Gibson and Nicole

   gang. Wade and all the girls survive and so does Reaper, who swears 
   to get even. The girls make it to their contest in Las Vegas and win

   action film that relies on the sleaze factor to get by. There's a 
   whipping, death by immolization, snakebite to the face, several gun 
   deaths and, of course, the ample samplings of the female cast. The 
   standout cast member here is Juanita Ranney as Skin, who is Reaper's 
   girl, but basically a good girl caught in a bad situation.&nbsp; 
   She's the only believable member of the cast. Jason Williams

   Here's a little-seen regional actioner that's truly a product of its 
   time. After an on-screen disclaimer (read by an uncredited John 
   Vernon) warning us that what we are about to see is based on a true 
   story (&quot;The names have been changed to protect the 
   innocent...&quot;), we are introduced to Vietnam veteran Fletcher 
   (Steve Barrett), who has just been robbed and grazed in the head with 
   a bullet (all of it off-screen) at the sporting goods store he owns. 
   Disillusioned with all the violence in the big city, Fletcher decides 
   to close down his store and move to the Oregon wilderness after 
   watching a commercial on TV (He places a sign that reads &quot;Moved 
   To Paradise&quot; on his shuttered storefront window!). He settles 
   into his sleepy Oregon town, where he opens an archery store and 
   meets Colonel John Swint (Roy Jenson; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Nightmare Honeymoon">NIGHTMARE
    HONEYMOON</A></B> - 1973), who invites Fletcher to his compound to 
   participate in what Fletcher believes to be harmless war games 
   involving paint guns. What Fletcher soon discovers is that Col. Swint 
   and his men are actually rabid survivalists who want him to join t<A HREF="day_of_the_survivalist_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/day of the survivalist vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>heir
    militia. The Colonel's heavily guarded compound sits directly in the 
   middle of a valley that is a perfect sanctuary if the United States 
   were to ever be attacked with nuclear weapons (which the Colonel 
   believes will happen very soon), but when Fletcher discovers that the 
   Colonel has all the bridges and roadways rigged with explosives to 
   stop people from entering or leaving the valley when the bombs fall, 
   he politely declines the Colonel's offer to join his backwoods band 
   of militia misfits. This doesn't sit too well with the Colonel or his 
   men, who decide to get rid of Fletcher before he spills the beans on 
   their operation to the cops. After watching Johnny Paycheck perform 
   &quot;I Love Rowdy People&quot; at a local bar (and then peppering 
   him with small talk at a table near the restrooms!), the Colonel 
   challenges Fletcher to break into the house of the hulking Reno 
   (Richard Beyer) as an exercise to test Fletcher's silent breaking-and-entering
    abilities. What Fletcher doesn't realize is that he is being set-up, 
   so when he breaks into Reno's house and Reno ends up dead due to one 
   of the Colonel's forest booby-traps (which was meant for Fletcher), 
   he becomes a wanted man by the law, who believe that Fletcher is 
   suffering from &quot;Post Vietnam Syndrome&quot; and has snapped. 
   Fletcher takes Reno's vengeance-minded sister, Evelyn (Karen Rae), 
   hostage when she tries to kill him and they both head into the 
   forest, with the Colonel (who has just killed the Sheriff and his 
   deputy after they find the Colonel's explosives under a bridge) and 
   his men not far behind. The remainder of the film finds Fletcher 
   using the skills he learned in Vietnam to defeat the Colonel's men 
   while falling in love with Evelyn. The finale comes when Fletcher and 
   the Colonel duke it out in a cave, which culminates in Fletcher 
   burying a hatchet in the Colonel's head. If I made any of this film 
   sound the least bit interesting or entertaining, I apologize 
   profusely because watching grass grow or paint dry is infinitely more 
   exciting than anything this film has to offer.&nbsp; This atrocious 
   actioner, directed/produced by one-shot wonder William H. Humphrey 
   and written by Barry Hostetler, is a chore to sit through. It's not 
   only horrendously acted (Roy Jenson is the only actor here with 
   previous experience), the action scenes are also badly-staged and 
   photographed. Steve Barrett, who looks like Tom Savini's illegitimate 
   brother, has the charisma of a piece of quartz and the acting talent 
   to match, which makes every scene he's in a test of the viewers' 
   patience. That's not a good thing considering he accounts for 80% of 
   the film and, as if things couldn't get any worse, his on-screen 
   chemistry with Karen Rae (who is also awful) is like watching a 
   brother and sister French kiss. What <B><A HREF="day_of_the_survivalist_1985b.htm">DAY
    OF THE SURVIVALIST</A></B> truly lacks is pacing, as it looks like 
   it was edited by someone with a severe case of ADD. Scenes jump from 
   one sequence to the next, sometimes in mid-sentence, with no 
   narrative tissue to connect them. The violence is also rather tame 
   and lazily filmed and includes a bloodless pitchfork-in-the-neck and 
   various bloodless arrow impalements. There's zero entertainment value 
   to be had here and it's not even good enough for an occasional 
   unintentional laugh, so what's the point? Other films in the

   &quot;Nooooooo!&quot;). The film then switches to a hostage situation 
   at a restaurant where cop Robbie (Rudy Fernandez) shoots and kills 
   hostage taker Junior. Junior's father Martin (Robert Arevalo), a 
   local crime lord, retaliates and sends his men to kill Robbie, but 
   they mistakenly shoot and seriously injure his father instead. Robbie 
   quits the force and decides to go after Martin on his own. Meanwhile, 
   Duke is reassigned to an American military base as an MP, close to 
   where Robbie lives. Robbie's friends plan to rob the Bank of American 
   Express on the military base and they want Robbie to join <A HREF="day_they_bobbed_america_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/day they robbed america vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>them,
    but he declines. Duke gets into a fight with local gunrunners at a 
   bar where Robbie is having a drink. Robbie notices Duke's fighting 
   abilities and compliments him on them. When Robbie learns his father 
   is going to need an expensive operation, he has no choice but to join 
   in on the bank robbery, but he brings in friends Boiler (a marksman) 
   and Sausage (the brawny muscle) for extra insurance. Martin has his 
   men burn down Robbie's house, nearly killing his wife and kids. 
   Robbie grabs a machine gun and systematically begins gunning down 
   Martin's men, nearly missing the robbery start time. They finally 
   perform the robbery, sneaking into the military base disquising 
   themselves as sandwich men. As they are robbing the bank, they are 
   caught off-guard by Duke and the MPs, which leads to a shootout 
   (Boiler, the marksman, is the first to die) and a hostage situation. 
   Duke's new girlfriend Carol (Donna Villa), a bank teller, is taken 
   hostage by Ronnie, which leads to a short car chase and another 
   shootout. Duke rescues Carol as Ronnie and his gang disappear into 
   the jungle. Robbie buries the money and disappears, as Duke goes 
   commando and begins killing all the robbers one-by-one. The finale 
   finds Duke and Robbie shooting it out and neither one comes out 
   unscathed.&nbsp; More plot-heavy than most Filippino action films, 
   this flick (set in 1971) still has it's share of violent action 
   setpieces, once the robbery starts. Until then, we are treated to 
   Duke's numerous flashbacks to his dead girlfriend (he usually has 
   them while trying to romance his new girlfriend!), various subplots 
   involving gun runners trying to kill Duke and Martin trying to kill 
   Robbie (who is credited as &quot;Ruben&quot; in the final credits). 
   The funniest scene happens when Robbie's father is shot. Robbie stops 
   a Jeep containing three American soldiers and asks for help, but they 
   refuse! (To see a YouTube clip of this scene, supplied by the always 
   reliable William Wilson, click <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1q4gfZuDw4">HERE</A>.).
    There are plenty of shootouts (lots and lots of bullet squibs), 
   outrageous dubbing (&quot;If he talks now, we're all in the 
   shit!&quot;) and very unflattering depictions of the American 
   military complex. I also love how Robbie has a mistress and the film 
   seems to imply that there's nothing wrong with it. Another funny (and 
   shocking) scene comes near the finale as Robbie is trying to drive to 
   safety with his mistress in the car. With the sound of sirens and the 
   glare of flashing lights in the background, she says, &quot;Robbie, 
   someone is following us! Maybe it's the police!&quot;, just before 
   she gets shot in the back and dies immediately! While lacking the 
   sheer lunacy of <B><A HREF="action.htm#Final Score">FINAL SCORE</A></B>

   (they really should have given him a name!) orders Kilpatrick to stop 
   the killings because Jake is getting too close to the truth (&quot;We

   a No. 6 piano wire. Kilpatrick and his team execute a search warrant 
   at Jake's house and plant a gun that killed some of his parolees. 
   Jake is arrested, but released after Kilpatrick makes a not-so-veiled 
   threat against him and his wife, Lana (Michelle Berger), letting Jake 
   know how easy it would be to set him up for his wife's murder. The 
   Police Captain finally relents and orders Kilpatrick to kill Jake

    COMMANDO</A><A NAME="DeadlyCommando"></A> (1982) -</B> A crack unit 
   of Amy soldiers (known as The Savage Six) are sent to rescue a 
   kidnapped ambassador in this surprisingly expansive Filipino war 
   action film, filled with stunts, gun battles and explosions. They 
   successfully rescue the ambassador and celebrate at a bar, where they 
   get into a (prerequisite) fight with a group of drunk patrons (one of 
   the soldiers beats up half the bar using nothing but a food plate!) 
   which ends with them being sent to the stockade. When an Army general 
   agrees to a peace talk with some opposition guerillas, he's kidnapped 
   by a group led by someone called the Professor (Boy Garcia). The 
   crack unit is sent in to rescue the general in a commando raid, but 
   first they must be freed from the stockade. The Professor's sister, 
   Adora (Elisabeth Rope), agrees to work with The Savage Six from the 
   inside (she's a guerilla, too, but it doesn't agree with her brothers 
   politics), while the commandos parachute out of a helicopter and land 
   behind enemy lines. The Professor is well aware of their presence and 
   puts his <A HREF="deadly_commando_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/deadly commando aka suicide force vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>camp
    on alert. When the Professor refuses to listen to his sister's plea 
   for peace, Adora and her group join forces with The Savage Six, but 
   when they raid the Professor's camp, it is deserted. The Professor 
   then puts out word that his sister is a traitor and calls for all the 
   guerillas in the area to kill her and her group as well as the Savage 
   Six. Almost immediately, they are ambushed by the enemy and must 
   fight their way out of a sticky situation (and amazingly, walk away 
   without a single casualty). The Savage Six rescue the general in a 
   cave, but become trapped there when the Professor and his guerillas 
   surround them. The finale finds the Savage Six and Adora fighting 
   impossible odds to bring the general back to safety. After the 
   Professor is killed by a mortar round (he blows up real good) and our 
   heroes make it to safety (with only one casualty!), an off-screen 
   voice tells us that the general's mission was a success and both 
   sides signed a peace treaty.&nbsp; This early 80's Filipino action 
   film, directed by Nick Cacas, (<B><A HREF="#ForgottenWarrior">FORGOTTEN
    WARRIOR</A></B> - 1986) and Segundo Ramos (<A HREF="action.htm#DeathRaiders1984"><B>DEATH
    RAIDERS</B></A> - 1984), is more political than most 
   Philippines-made actioners (script by Donald Arthur). This may be 
   because some real-life Army generals and personnel portray themselves 
   here, as the Americans are portrayed as understanding, 
   willing-to-make-a-deal patriots, while the guerillas (one of them 
   sports a mohawk!) are depicted as trigger-happy thugs (when one of 
   the Professor's men suggests to him in the finale that they should 
   surrender, he shoots him!). While the violence isn't all that bloody 
   (just plenty of bullet hits, a couple of head shots and some 
   stabbings), the action comes fast and furious. Particularly striking 
   is the final scene of the film, a long shot in slow-motion of our 
   heroes escorting the general down a hill while it is repeatedly 
   bombarded by shellfire. It is a striking scene, almost poetic in it's 
   execution. The opening raid on the bad guy's house to free the 
   ambassador is also a triumph of execution, as the mansion the bad guy 
   lives in is quite a set piece and is not the usual choice for 
   explosions and carnage. While the middle portion of the film drags a 
   little (politics, passion and pathos comes into play at this time), 
   it's still fun watching a cast of Filipino pros, including Johnny 
   Wilson, George Pallance and George Estregan (billed here as 
   &quot;George Regan&quot;) playing members of the Savage Six. 
   Estregan, in particular, is a hoot, as he plays a ladies man who 
   finds time to makeout with a female guerilla in the middle of a 
   firefight! All three would basically reprise the same roles in Ramos' <B>DEATH

   balls!). While Hog is away from town purchasing a large cache of 
   weapons, the greatful townspeople make Cody the sheriff (Hog shot the 
   previous sheriff in the head.). Cody makes Bolie (Norman Bernard), a 
   hungry prisoner not affiliated with Hog, his deputy and together they 
   try to make the peace-loving townsfolk take up arms in participation 
   of Hog's return. Some people refuse, but will they change their minds 
   when they see their friends and neighbors being killed? The finale 
   shows Cody and some of the townspeople defending their town and 
   defeating Hog. Just when it seems that everything is going to be OK, 
   a new gang drives into town. Is history about to repeat itself?&nbsp; 
   This impossibly cheap, cut-rate action flick is the second 
   directorial effort of one-man wrecking crew David Heavener (his first 
   being the even worse <B><A HREF="david_heavener_directed_films.htm">OUTLAW
    FORCE</A></B> - 1988). Besides directing and acting in this, he also 
   wrote the highly-derivative script and even grabs a guitar and sings 
   us a song! It's apparent that Heavener fancies himself as a 
   low-budget Clint Eastwood, as he copies Eastwood's mannerisms, cigar 
   chomping and Western clothing (this is like a sci-fi version of 
   Eastwood's <B><A HREF="pale_rider_1985.htm">PALE RIDER</A></B> 
   [1985]), but the sad fact is that Eastwood's shadow conveys more 
   emotion and range than Heavener could ever hope to possess. Heavener 
   does fill the screen with plenty of nudity (Alyson Davis as Shauna, 
   Cody's new love interest, looks particularly fine in the raw). The 
   violence is bloody (most of the blood comes from the plentiful bullet 
   squibs in the many gunfights), but the editing is confusing and 
   choppy (Heavener narrates parts of the film to cover-up scenes he 
   forgot to film or did not have the budget to film) and makes some of 
   the sequences hard to follow and downright perplexing. The most 
   perplexing part of the film comes when Hog assaults the town during 
   the final thirty minutes and Cody disappears for no discernable 
   reason, allowing Hog and his men to easily recapture the town since 
   the townspeople couldn't hit the side of a barn with a firearm. Cody 
   then reappears and takes back the town nearly single-handedly, which 
   negates everything Cody has said up till then. When the rest of the 
   town begin to fight back, Cody has already disposed of most of Hog's 
   men. It makes no sense to me. The Western post-nuke subgenre was 
   better served a few years later in the Pepin/Merhi (PM) Production <B><A HREF="steel_frontier_1995.htm">STEEL

   two player/rapists by stabbing one in the crotch and beating the 
   other's brains out with a pipe) and they become lovers. When Lt. 
   MacGrew proves to be just, if not more, crooked and deadly as Steele, 
   Chase (with the help of Diana and best friend Eddie [Reggie 
   DeMorton]) must figure a way out of this mess and the only way seems 
   to be by killing everyone who wants to kill him. In the finale, Chase 
   gives The Chairman a taste of his own game that he will never 
   forget.&nbsp; Somewhere within this film is a germ of a good idea 
   but, unfortunately, the execution and the acting by most of the 
   actors leaves a lot to be desired. It will come as no surprise then 
   to learn that this is an early film for production company <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#AIP">Action
    International Pictures</A>, who turned out dozens of low-budget 
   action films from the mid-80's to the early 90's.

   lot of action setpieces (car and boat chases, gunfights and 
   fistfights), but they all suffer from a certain cheapness, the same 
   problem that early Richard Pepin/Joseph Merhi Productions (such as <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Repo Jake">REPO

   (I especially like the scene where Chase is being pursued by two 
   hitwomen in an auto junkyard) if you can just get passed it's poverty 
   level of filmmaking. Director Prior seems to love using bullet squibs 
   here, so there are plenty of bloody gunshot deaths. I just wish he 
   had a better editor, as most of the action scenes are poorly composed

   made this, a stunt-filled comedy action adventure about the exploits 
   of two movie stuntmen, Steve (John Hargreaves) and Rod (Grant Page), 
   on-and-off the movie set. After foiling (what they think is) a real 
   bank robbery and getting heat from his wife Julia (Margaret Gerard), 
   Steve relates (in a flashback) how he and Rod have been doing 
   reckless things together ever since they were in the Army's Commando 
   Forces during the Vietnam War. Steve and Rod are taken at gunpoint to 
   the estate of Mr. Culpepper (Noel Ferrier), a top secret Australian 
   government official who wants to hire them to perform a special 
   assignment (the bank robbery was a set-up to test their skills). 
   After thinking it over for a couple of days (Culpepper won't tell 
   them what the assignment is until they agree to work for him) and 
   performing some stunts on a film shoot, Steve and Rod take on 
   Culpepper's assignment (Steve tells his worried, but understanding,

   like M in the James Bond films, complete with a Miss Moneypenny-like 
   secretary named Gloria [Judith Woodroffe], who horndog Rod keeps 
   hitting on) wants Steve and Rod to take a submarine to an island in

   international criminal Augustino Hernandez and steal some <A HREF="death_cheaters_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death cheaters vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>important
    documents from his safe. First, Steve and Rod must go to &quot;The 
   Farm&quot;, a secret government training facility, to get in shape, 
   but after running through a boobytrapped obstacle course and coming 
   out unscathed and beating their best martial artist, it's apparent 
   that they are already in tip-top shape (they both wear t-shirts with 
   &quot;Cunning Stunts&quot; printed on the front during this 
   sequence). They then take the submarine to the island in the 
   Philippines and begin their adventure. They split up once they set 
   foot on the island; Steve heads for the fortress through the jungle 
   (where he has a close call with a land mine), while Rod climbs the 
   steep cliffs on the other side of the fortress. While Rod sets off 
   some explosive diversions and draws enemy fire, Steve uses a hang 
   glider to enter the fortress and then some stung gags to steal the 
   documents, pick up Rod and head back to the submarine to safety and 
   then on to the premiere of Rod's latest film role: As a knight who is 
   set on fire for a deodorant TV commercial!&nbsp; This lighthearted 
   comedy action film benefits greatly from the chemistry between John 
   Hargreaves and Grant Page. Their comic banter and breezy delivery 
   enhances the proceedings immensely as do the stunts we see Page 
   perform (he's a real-life stuntman), including fire gags, building 
   falls and car chases and crashes (the illusion of danger is much 
   greater when we see one of the stars actually performing the stunts). 
   Director Brian Trenchard-Smith, who would make the crazy and even 
   more stunt-filled <B><A HREF="#StuntRock">STUNT ROCK</A></B> (1978) 
   next, keeps things moving at a brisk pace, skipping such important 
   story elements as character development and plot details, but still 
   giving us a little insight into Steve and Rod's personal and 
   professional lives. The fact that no one dies in this film and we 
   never actually meet international criminal Augustino Hernandez or see 
   Steve actually steal the important documents should show you where 
   this film's tongue is firmly planted. Noel Ferrier (the evil 
   Secretary Mallory in Trenchard-Smith's bloody <B><A HREF="escape_2000_1982.htm">ESCAPE
    2000</A></B> [1982]) plays Culpepper with a dry wit, falling asleep 
   while showing the stuntmen an important roll of film, making comical 
   asides and playing chess with Julia (and losing every game) while 
   thay await word of the duo's success or failure. Ralph Cotterill also 
   registers as Culpepper's right-hand man (listed in the credits simply 
   as &quot;Un-Civil Servant&quot;), who dresses like a gangster 
   (complete with white suit and fedora) and fancies himself an expert 
   martial artist, only to be upstaged by Steve and Rod at every turn. 
   Grant Page, who also appeared as the assassin in Trenchard-Smith's <B><A HREF="action.htm#ManFromHongKong">THE
    MAN FROM HONG KONG</A></B> (and also did a hang glider stunt in that 
   film) and starred in his <B><A HREF="#StuntRock">STUNT ROCK</A></B>

   SKIN UNDER THE CLAWS</A></B> - 1975). The Bulgarian has his men cause 
   a disturbance, which allows Jason to escape and elude the police. 
   Jason, who use to live in Athens, knows his way around town and goes 
   looking for his old nightclub business partner Pizza (Vittorio 
   Caprioli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Blood&amp;Diamonds1977">BLOOD AND DIAMONDS</A></B> 
   - 1977) to help him hide, but is captured by The Bulgarian and his 
   men. They don't want him dead, though, as the Bulgarian tells Jason 
   that if he can retrieve an item he is after, he will pay him $20,000 
   (Jason has been in prison many times, but, like Houdini, he always 
   finds a way to escape). The item turns out to be a tooth in the mouth 
   of a dead prisoner, who is about to be transported to his burial. 
   Jason manages to sneak into the prison, pull the tooth out of the 
   dead prisoner's mouth with a pair of pliers and escapes by hiding the 
   prisoner's body and taking his place in the coffin, getting out of 
   prison easier than breaking into it. But why is everyone interested 
   in the tooth, wanting it enough to kill for it? I already told you 
   why (in the tooth is microfilm having the names of every British and 
   American undercover agent in Europe), but Jason is a tough customer, 
   looking for a way to double his money, by having Pizza make a copy of 
   the tooth. Pizza doesn't know it, but a dancer at his nightclub, 
   Rumba (Graziella Granata; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SlaughterVampires62">SLAUGHTER
    OF THE VAMPIRES</A></B> - 1962), has overheard his conversation with 
   Jason and decides to turn it to her advantage and make some money by 
   working with the Albanian, who wants the tooth enough to kill for it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After several close calls (including a rather good car chase, where 
   Jason jumps a drawbridge in Pizza's new car to escape from the 
   Albanian and the police; and a rather brutal piece of footage where 
   the Albanian and his men machinegun a young boy named Jamie [Hum 
   Silvers], who was helping Jason). Jason is disturbed to find that his 
   former flame Greta (Paola Pitagora; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Revolver1973">REVOLVER</A></B> 
   - 1973) is working with the Bulgarian to get the tooth and microfilm. 
   Greta tells Jason she is only doing it because her sister, who was 
   dating the dead prisoner behind the Iron Curtain, had a baby with him 
   and when they tried to escape by climbing over the Berlin Wall in 
   East Germany, only he made it, as her sister and her baby were 
   captured and her sister died in a Russian gulag not long after. She 
   only agreed to work with the Bulgarian because he told her he would 
   bring the baby to her if she succeeded in getting the tooth. Jason 
   promises Greta that he will makes sure the baby gets to her, no 
   matter what he has to do, but when the Bulgarian finds out Greta was 
   talking to Jason, he kills her by shooting her in both eyes 
   (offscreen). Jason is furious when Major Clark shows him Greta's 
   body, but the Major says something that brings suspicion to him in 
   Jason's eyes. When Rumba leads Jason to the Albanian and his men, she 
   pays for it with her life when the Albanian shoots her point 
   blank.&nbsp; Jason gets shot in the shoulder and just when the 
   Albanian is about to finish him off, Inspector Starkis and the Major 
   show up and kill the Albanian's men, but the Albanian escapes.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A short time later, the Albanian kidnaps Pizza, takes him to his old 
   deserted nightclub that was run by Pizza and Jason, tortures him with 
   a blowtorch and constant pummeling to get him to say where the tooth 
   is, but no matter how much they hurt him, Pizza refuses to answer. 
   Jason then breaks in and a gunfight ensues and the Major shows up and 
   kills the Albanian. Jason asks Pizza where the real tooth is and he 
   tells him he had it all along. It was in the keychain he gave Jason 
   when he borrowed his car. Jason left the keychain at the front door 
   in a padlock, but when he goes to retrieve it, it is gone. Major 
   Clark orders Inspector Starkis to arrest Jason and he is taken to the 
   station to be questioned. Jason makes a deal with the Inspector, 
   offering the microfilm in exchange for a hefty sum of money and the 
   return of Greta's sister's baby and he will tell him the name of a 
   traitor in his group. The traitor is Major Worthington Clark, who is 
   actually a double agent working for the Russians. A prisoner exchange 
   is then arranged, Major Clark for the baby, but the Inspector arrests 
   and handcuffs Jason, telling him he and Pizza will get the money when 
   Jason finishes the prison term he was about to serve in Athens when 
   he escaped. We then discover that Major Clark made a copy of the 
   microfilm, so the allies and the enemies are in a stalemate, as all 
   the undercover agents will have to leave their posts and the Russians 
   gain nothing. Jason hands the baby<A HREF="death_on_the_run_1967.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death on the run italy poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   to Pizza and tells him to take care of it until he returns, which 
   won't be long because, &quot;No prison can hold me.&quot; It turns 
   out to be sooner than we think, as when Jason is being escorted away 
   by the Inspector and his men, he forces the car to crash and he 
   escapes, the film ending exactly as it began, with Jason running away 
   on the airport tarmac and dodging gunfire. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE

   including a really long footchase on the ancient Greece ruins of the 
   Acropolis, something that could never be attempted today (at least 
   not without plenty of CGI). I have to admit that I was taken aback by 
   the brutal killing of the young boy, as violence against children is 
   not pleasant to watch, but I do give Corbucci credit for actually 
   showing it and not turning the camera away. Hey, this is nothing 
   extraordinary, just a simple chase film with plenty of gunfire, 
   deaths and other violence, but it's still a fun film to watch, thanks 
   to its Italian sensibilities. One thing that really stands out in 
   this film are Gordon Mitchell's extremely blue eyes. But a word of 
   warning: Staring at them will probably put you in a trance! If you

   when all three parties meet and fight to the death.&nbsp; I really 
   liked this film. It's well-acted by a cast of relative unknowns and 
   one-time director Paul M. DeGruccio keeps the the action flowing at a 
   speedy clip, letting enough blood and nudity creep in so that you are 
   never bored. There also a hefty amount of humor in the script (by Dan 
   Peacock and Paul Natale) that catches you off-guard among the grim 
   proceedings. Tony Sacco complaining about the type of car that came 
   to pick him up at the airport is a priceless piece of dialogue and 
   editing. And just wait till you see what Tony uses under the wheels 
   when his car gets stuck in the desert. The effects are also brutal. 
   You will see several bloody head shots, a man shot in the groin, 
   scenes of stomachs being slit open, throat slashings, a grenade being 
   shoved into a goon's mouth and a major character has his hands nailed 
   to a table and then stabbed in the back. Also, dig the carnage when 
   Angel's girlfriend meets a cactus at 60 mph. I had a good time with 
   this hard-to-find film. It's an almost perfect blend of action, 
   violence and humor. If you can find this anywhere, pick it up! Also

   Carlos is waiting with a sniper rifle (he's a lousy shot). A chase 
   ensues and they capture Carlos. After torturing him with a lobster 
   (!), Carlos agrees to take them to Tony. Everyone finally congregates 
   at a building that is being demolished. Besides fighting each other, 
   Tony and the Dion brothers must also contend with a wrecking ball, a 
   room full of chickens and holes in the floors. With the building 
   falling apart around them, the Dion brothers battle Tony and his 
   goons room-by-room and floor-by-floor, until only one is left 
   standing. Even though the ending is a bummer, you'll find yourself 
   laughing out loud many times before the film ends on a dour 
   note.&nbsp; This funny action flick benefits tremendously by Keach's 
   and Forrest's performances as two guys completely out of their 
   element. They rob to finance their dream (well, it's actually 
   Calvin's, but Russell goes along) of opening a fancy seafood 
   restaurant, even though they have never tasted seafood. They are 
   totally devoted to each other, though neither of them basically has a 
   clue as to what they are doing (This is Russell's opinion of school: 
   &quot;They fill your head with so much gosh-darned facts, there's no 
   room left to think!&quot;). There's not a mean-spirited bone in this 
   entire film until the finale. Even though there are gunfights, 
   violence and death, it's all so goofy and innoculous, it elicits 
   laughs rather than shock. The final building demolition 
   chase/gunfight is well-staged and exciting, as everyone runs, shoots 
   and falls through floors as the wrecking ball continuously strikes 
   the building, ending in a surprising death and a great fight between 
   Calvin and Tony. The cast of genre vets are excellent and also 
   includes Clay Tanner and Robert Phillips as members of Tony's gang, 
   Paul Dooley as a crooked doctor, future director Joe Tornatore (<B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Zebra Force">THE

    at the genre. Since he was also a cinematographer/production 
   manager/actor in most of H.B. Halicki's productions, Vacek had a 
   better handle than most on how to film car chases and this film works 
   for the most part, even though it stars a cast of non-professionals 
   and has a budget that wouldn't fill the craft table on a Hollywood 
   film. Vacek stars as Smokey, a Highway Patrol cop who likes to drive 
   fast (Just before he goes on duty, he loves to race his motorcycle to 
   work, leading the exasperated cops in the next town on daily high 
   speed chases. It's a game to Smokey, but the cops chasing him take it 
   very seriously, even though they never catch him.). Smokey loves his 
   job, but he's not your typical Highway Cop. He and his partner Ed (Ed 
   Abrams) have fun at their jobs and not every chase ends in an arrest 
   or a ticket. When Smokey and Ed pull over a guy named George (George 
   Cole), who's in the repo business, he offers them a job repossessing 
   cars in their spare time. They take him up on his offer (it gives 
   them a chance to drive fast during their off-hours and make extra 
   cash), but they only want to repossess fast cars, so George takes 
   them on a trial run where they watch George repo a car and learn the 
   ropes. Smokey meets a girl named Jordan (co-scripter Patrice 
   Schubert, Vacek's real-life wife) when he stops her for driving too 
   slow and he makes a date with her, but he shows up two hours late 
   when he and Ed's first repo job doesn't go as smoothly as it should. 
   Their next repo job is a disaster when Ed repos a Ford Pinto (what 
   happened to fast cars only?), leading cops on a chase (both Smokey 
   and Ed could be kicked off the force if they are discovered 
   moonlighting) down a few flights of extremely steep concrete stairs 
   (it's one of the slowest chases in film history!). The rest of the 
   film is a series of car chases, as Smokey and Ed repo cars (disguised 
   as lawn care professionals) or try to outrun the police that chase 
   them. Needless to say, there's not a fruit stand, flower shop, stack 
   of boxes full of Styrofoam popcorn or aqueduct that they don't manage 
   to crash into, plow over or hydroplane on, as they try to avoid 
   capture. Trouble ensues when Smokey and Ed discover that they are 
   being played for fools, as the cars (and even a sailboat) that they 
   have been repossessing are not repos at all; they are actually 
   stealing perfectly legally-owned cars that are being sold overseas or 
   stripped for parts by crime kingpin Lewis Sloan (Tex Taylor). How are 
   Smokey and Ed going to pull their asses out of this fire? With 
   George's help, Smokey and Ed steal a briefcase containing 
   incriminating evidence of Lewis' criminal enterprise, which leads to 
   the film's complex, stunt-filled car chase finale.&nbsp; This is an 
   innocuous actioner that contains no foul language, no bloody 
   violence, no nudity and really nothing offensive at all. Just plenty 
   of car chases and extremely bad acting (a lot of dialogue seems 
   improvised). If that's your cup of tea, you should enjoy <B><A HREF="double_nickels_1977b.htm">DOUBLE

   to retrieve his ten-year-old son, Jan (Edison Navarro; Mattei's <B><A HREF="strike_commando_1987.htm">STRIKE
    COMMANDO</A></B> - 1987), whom he was forced to abandon when the war 
   ended. Bob tells a member of the Vietnam government that he is not 
   leaving the country without his son, only to be told that his 
   marriage to Jan's mother was not considered legal, therefore he has 
   no rights to Jan, he is a ward of Vietnam. The official tells Bob if 
   he were now to get remarried legally, he might have a right to claim 
   his son, but Bob tells the official he damn well knows that his wife 
   died in a Vietnam P.O.W. camp. The official corrects Bob, telling him 
   it was a &quot;re-education&quot; camp, where women corrupted by 
   American propaganda were schooled to bring them back to the Vietnam 
   way of life. The official then gets a phone call and tells Bob to 
   follow him, he may have a solution to his problem. Bob is then thrown 
   into a dark room, where Russian nastie Colonel Galckin (Bo Svenson; <B><A HREF="action.htm#BrothersInBlood1987">BROTHERS
    IN BLOOD</A></B> - 1987) tells Bob not to take another step closer, 
   if he does, his right hand man, Talbukin (David Anderson; <B><A HREF="#MannigansForce">MANNIGAN'S

   Colonel Galckin wants to know the real reason he is in Vietnam, not 
   believing his story that he is here to get his son. Bob doesn't care 
   if he believes him or not and pummels Talbukin, knocking him out and 
   escaping the building, with Galckin's soldiers close behind, but 
   Galckin tells them he wants Bob taken alive. Just when it looks like 
   Bob is about to be captured, a helicopter appears and an American 
   agent tells Bob to hop on, which he does (quite acrobatically) and he escapes.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   officer, Colonel Waters (Mike Monty; <B><A HREF="action.htm#DogTags1985">DOG
    TAGS</A></B> - 1985), is waiting for him. He tells Bob that someone 
   important wants to talk to him and if he agrees to this man's terms, 
   it could very well mean that he will get his son back. That man is 
   Senator Blaster (Donald Pleasence; <B><A HREF="last_platoon_1988.htm">LAST
    PLATOON</A></B> - 1988), an asthmatic no-nonsense government 
   official who tells Bob he wants him to find and kill Colonel Galckin 
   and Talbukin because they are training terrorists to kill Americans 
   all over the world, the latest attacks at a Hong Kong hospital and a 
   U.S. embassy in Malaysia were done by terrorists trained by Galckin 
   and Talbukin. Senator Blaster gives Bob five days to find and kill 
   them and during these five days he will have the full backing and 
   latest weapons from the U.S. government. If, after five days, he 
   fails his mission, he is on his own and the government will deny all 
   knowledge of him. Bob tells Senator Blaster that when he completes 
   this mission, if he doesn't get his son back, he will shove his

    We then see Bob in a submarine, being shot out of a torpedo tube in 
   full scuba gear. When he surfaces, an enemy soldier in a rubber raft 
   is waiting for him, gun drawn, but a shark knocks him out of the raft 
   and eats him! The shark then chases Bob into an underwater cave, 
   trapping him, but he uses one of his high-tech weapons to blow the 
   shark's head clean off its body! He then surfaces and the next time 
   we see Bob, he's in the jungle. A deadly cobra tries to bite him, but 
   he is saved from certain death by Toro (Ottaviano Dell'Acqua, as 
   &quot;Richard Raymond&quot;; Mattei's <B><A HREF="action.htm#StrikeCommando2">STRIKE

   pistol. Toro is Bob's first contact, so he and his band of jungle 
   mercenaries take Bob to a village full of children and Toro tells Bob 
   that his son Jan is here. Bob meets Jan for the first time in over 
   ten years and he tells his son that there's something that he has to 
   do first, but when he is done, he's taking him to the United States 
   to live with him. Jan just sits there, no emotion whatsoever on his 
   face. As Bob walks away, Jan looks at a photo his father gave him. It 
   is a photo of Bob with Jan's mother. Jan tears the photo in half, 
   discarding the half containing Bob's image and kissing the other half 
   containing the image of his mother, which he then tucks in his shirt. 
   Is it too late for Bob to connect with Jan?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Toro and his men take Bob down river and into the jungle, where they 
   come across a couple of &quot;Ruskies&quot; and kill them. Bob and 
   Toro don their clothes, steal their truck and as they are driving 
   Toro asks Bob if he is really doing all this for his son. Bob says 
   yes and Toro admires him for it. They then enter a secret Russian 
   military base and Bob sneaks into a building containing records and 
   begins photographing some of the records pertaining to Colonel 
   Galckin and Talbukin while Toro stands guard. A helicopter containing 
   Galckin and Talbukin lands at the base and they know Bob is there. 
   Bob and Toro steal a motorcycle with a sidecar and begin destroying 
   everything they pass, escaping by the skin of their teeth by jumping 
   into the river. Galckin and Talbukin take several helicopters to the 
   village of children, taking the entire village hostage. Talbukin 
   demands to know which boy is the American's son and when no one will 
   talk he shoots a man point blank in the head and says everyone will 
   be killed unless someone tells him who is Bob's son. Jan steps 
   forward and says, &quot;It is I, but I don't know the man you call my 
   father and I don't want to know him. I hope you catch him!&quot; Does 
   he really mean it? I'm sure he does at the time, but things will

    Bob and Toro are staking out the village and discover all the 
   children are being held in a single hut. Bob tells Toro it is time to 
   &quot;set all hell loose&quot;, so they begin destroying the village 
   with grenade launchers and other explosive devices. While Bob is 
   destroying the village and killing Galckin's men, Toro saves all the 
   children by knocking the stuffing out of Talbukin. Toro then grabs 
   Jan and brings him to his father. As Bob, Jan and Toro are running 
   through the jungle trying to escape from Galckin's mercenaries, Toro 
   steps on a landmine and is seriously wounded. Toro tells Bob and Jan 
   to leave without him, go meet their next contact and he will slow 
   down Galckin's approaching army. Bob and Jan reluctantly leave (after 
   Bob clears the field of landmines with one of his high-tech weapons) 
   and Toro waits with a grenade in his hand, the pin pulled. As the 
   army approaches, Toro Sacrifices himself by stepping on another 
   landmine and taking a few of Galckin's army with him, slowing them 
   down enough for Bob to meet his next contact, Mary (Kristine 
   Erlandson; <B><A HREF="#FinalReprisal1988">FINAL REPRISAL</A></B> -

   hours before the submarine leaves, so she takes them to a trading 
   village to get something to eat when Jan says he is hungry. Once in 
   the village, Bob can smell trouble brewing, so he does a neat trick 
   with a grenade and a coconut, killing everyone at a table who look at 
   them suspiciously. It turns out Bob was correct, this is an enemy 
   ambush and McDougall is gunned down while Bob destroys the village 
   with plenty of fiery explosions (Bob has a thing for destroying 
   everything in his path!). Bob, Jan and Mary hide in the jungle and 
   must keep still as Talbukin and some men look for them. They almost 
   blow their cover (and their lunch) when giant spiders crawl over 
   their bodies, but they are able to brush them off when the enemy 
   passes them.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Meanwhile, Senator Blaster acts like he doesn't want Bob's mission 
   to succeed, even threatening to cancel the mission, but Colonel 
   Waters convinces him that Bob is the right man for the job and he 
   will succeed (Blaster acts like he is the enemy rather than an ally).

   where Mary is shot and wounded and they are all taken prisoner by 
   Galckin. Galckin hands Jan a pistol and tells him if he meant what he 
   said before to shoot Bob in the head, but he can't do it. Galckin 
   knew he wouldn't be able to and reveals that the pistol wasn't 
   loaded, telling Bob he is to be executed tomorrow morning. Will Bob 
   complete his mission? Will Jan call Bob &quot;Daddy&quot;? Will Mary 
   join Bob and Jan in the United States to live with them? If you

    I don't know what it is with Bruno Mattei and his '80s action 
   flicks, but he takes chances other genre filmmakers fear to tread, 
   such as over-the-top-explosions, ultra-bloody bullet squibs and even 
   an exploding shark's head. All these ingredients work in Mattei's 
   favor, as we should be shaking our heads in disbelief, but we find 
   ourselves admiring Mattei's moxey instead. The screenplay, by Mattei 
   and his longtime collaborator Claudio Fragasso (as &quot;Clyde

    a smuggling shipment that they are going to pick up at the docks the 
   next morning. Sonny goes to Cleo's house to tell her about it, but 
   she still doesn't believe him, so he goes to the docks by himself the 
   next morning, beats up all the smugglers with his bionic arms and 
   legs (filmed in super slow-motion, while an electricic da-da-da sound 
   plays on the soundtrack) and steals the metal briefcase containing 
   the smugglers' goods (a new kind of radioactive uranium). With the 
   briefcase as proof, Cleo has no other option but to believe Sonny 
   (finally!). They both must now fight a succession of goons and, 
   ultimately, the giant mechanical dragon, as the plot thickens and 
   Nazis are brought into the mix. Agent DeLeon (Franco Guerrero) is 
   assigned to babysit Sonny (easier said than done) while Cleo 
   investigates. In the finale Cleo, Sonny and Agent DeLeon fight a 
   bunch of wetsuit-clad bad guys on an island that holds a deadly 
   secret. I laughed, I cried, I nearly died.&nbsp; This goofy,

   should be considered a national treasure; not because he makes good 
   films, mind you, but because he showed the world that Sweden was more 
   than capable of churning out cheap, enjoyable exploitation films 
   (once you get your head around all those &quot;Swenglish&quot; [a 
   combination of Swedish/English] accents). This film opens with a 
   sappy 80's power ballad (called, appropriately enough, &quot;Eagle 
   Island&quot;) playing on the soundtrack while we watch a group of 
   Russian frogmen exit from a submarine and swim to the title island, 
   where some poor guard dressed in military fatigues is <A HREF="eagle_island_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/eagle island german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>killed
    with two crossbow bolts. The frogmen set off some silent alarms, so 
   base commander Eddie Foster (Tom O'Rourke; TV's <B><A HREF="law_order_tv_series.htm">LAW
    &amp; ORDER</A></B>) sends his best man, civilian Simon (Tim Earle; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Wardogs1986">WARDOGS</A></B> 
   - 1986) to check it out. Simon decides he is &quot;too bushed&quot; 
   to check it out (he thinks it is just some errant rabbits), so he 
   asks friend Tom (Henning Olofsson) to do it instead. Tom is pushed 
   off a cliff by one of the frogmen (who are now dressed as black-clad 
   ninjas!) and dies after crashing on the rocks below (his body smashes 
   against the rocks with a resounding &quot;Thud!&quot;). The next 
   morning, after a breakfast of fish and beer (!) with Eddie, 
   Simon&nbsp; decides to check out the area himself (apparently, Tom's 
   body has been found, but the dead guard is still missing; it's just 
   too confusing to really tell), when he spots two women, Anna 
   (SummerLee Thomas) and Helen (Lisa Robinson), heading towards the 
   island in a small boat. Eddie is in deep shit when his commanding 
   officer, Colonel Frank Crayton (Terry D. Seago), comes to the island 
   by helicopter and relieves him of duty, blaming Eddie for Tom's death 
   (gee, news travels really fast, but what about the missing guard?). 
   Eddie quits the military instead (a reasonable reaction considering 
   the way he is being treated) and is told by Col. Crayton that he has 
   to leave the island in ten minutes. Anna and Helen turn out to be two 
   nosy photojournalists who say they are trying to get photos of rare 
   eagles that only inhabit this island (hence its name), but it's plain 
   to see that they're here to try and get evidence of why the military 
   occupies this island. To make an extremely confusing long story 
   short, Col. Clayton turns out to be a traitor working in cahoots with 
   the frogmen/ninjas, while Eddie, Simon, Anna and Helen try to stop a 
   crew from a Russian submarine from taking over the island with Col. 
   Clayton's help. Why are Clayton and the Russians doing this? Well, 
   you can be sure it's not over the tasty (and valuable) eagle eggs 
   that litter the island. It's over an egg of a different sort: a 
   device known as &quot;The Egg&quot; that contains data of all the 
   locations of American spy satellites. The war is on!&nbsp; Not much 
   in the logic department happens during the film's running time but, 
   damn, the film is goofy as hell, with weird fight scenes (the fight 
   between Simon and Clayton is one of the unintentionally funniest, 
   weirdly-choreographed fight scenes I've had the pleasure of watching, 
   as Clayton is constantly interrupted from radioing-in to his Russian 
   counterparts by Simon, who refuses to stay down), lines of English 
   dialogue (screenplay by Madeleine Bruzelius; co-writer of <B>THE 
   FORGOTTEN WELLS</B>) that could only make sense to the Swedish 
   (&quot;Everyone on their toes, got it?&quot;) and lots of bloody 
   violence we have come to expect from a Mats Helge film. While not 
   over-the-top as <B>NINJA MISSION</B> (but, to be fair, what is?), <B><A HREF="eagle_island_1986b.htm">EAGLE
    ISLAND</A></B> has more than its fair share of gunfights, stabbings, 
   bullet-ridden corpses and deaths by crossbow, not to mention a 
   romance between Eddie and Anna (that seems way out of place in 
   context with the rest of the film) and a brutal beatdown and torture 
   of Lt. Thomson (Mats Hudden) by Russian bad guy Petrowics (Willy 
   Boholm) when he refuses to reveal the location of The Egg. Helen is 
   also graphically (and rather matter-of-factly) shot in the face 
   shortly after she stabs Petrowics in the back when he threatens to 
   rape her. Tastes may vary, but in the right frame of mind, <B>EAGLE ISLAND</B>

   killing all the men and women they come across (but not before raping 
   some of the females, as one shot shows a sweaty bad guy hitching-up 
   his pants after walking out of a burning hut, followed by a village 
   girl stumbling out a few seconds later holding her blood-covered 
   vagina!). They cap off the invasion by decapitating the village 
   leader in front of everyone while Bogart proclaims himself &quot;King 
   Bogart&quot;. Those villagers who are not killed are sold as slaves 
   at auctions populated by rich Dutch Imperialists. Years later, Panji 
   (Baron Hermanto) and his mother (Tatiek Wardiyono), who were the son 
   and wife of the decapitated village leader, break-up a slave auction 
   and save the beautiful Mira (Alba Fuad) from a life of servitude. The 
   only problem is that Mira's cure may be worse than the disease, as 
   Isabella (Nina Anwar), who is leading a revolution to overthrow the 
   current regime, believes Mira is the only girl that can bring down 
   the brutal Bogart, as long as she is trained right. Isabella puts 
   Mira through a series of sexual tortures to toughen-up her body and 
   mind, so she can become an undercover prostitute (The tortures 
   include making her lay on a slab o<A HREF="empire_on_fire_1988c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/empire on fire dvd-r front small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>f
    red-hot piece of metal and pounding her vagina with a piece of wood 
   until she loses all feeling in it!). Once Mira is deemed ready, she 
   is sent out to seduce General Tengga (Atut Agustinanto) and Dutchman 
   Captain James (Jurek Pheszynski). Mira has had a previous 
   relationship with James, as he once promised to marry her, but then 
   sold her into slavery once he got into her panties. Mira knows she 
   must kill Bogart, but it is James that she really wants to put six 
   feet under. Panji falls in love with Mira during her training 
   sessions and he doesn't want her to go through with the mission, but 
   her taste for revenge outweighs her love for Panji. When Mira finally 
   gets the chance to bed the horny Bogart, her assassination attempt is 
   interrupted when a jealous Panji invades Bogart's castle and he is 
   captured and thrown in the dungeon. Mira must now decide what is more 
   important to her: Killing Bogart and Captain James or rescuing Panji 
   from the dungeon. Bogart's main concubine, the undercover Isabella 
   (who is really working in conjunction with James to take over 
   Bogart's empire [whew, this is getting complicated!]), pretends to 
   get jealous of Bogart's attention paid to Mira and plays General 
   Tengga against Bogart, which actually helps Mira and her mission. The 
   finale finds Mira killing James by throwing acid in his face and 
   slashing him repeatedly with a dagger; Captain Tengga offing Bogart 
   with a spear to the gut; Isabella shot through the back with an arrow 
   when she tries to hang Mira; and Panji killing Captain Tengga by 
   planting a sword in his stomach (and breaking the blade in the 
   process), God, I love happy endings!&nbsp; Though not as violent as

   (The strangest being the sight of scores of scantily-clad women being 
   tortured in the underground lair to toughen-up their bodies and 
   private parts so they can withstand Bogart's rough rape sessions), 
   you can't help but enjoy yourself. Particularly interesting is the 
   way Firmansjah integrates so many sex scenes into the film without 
   actually showing any female nudity (the closest the film comes is 
   when we see some women's nipples through their wet clothing as they 
   bathe by a waterfalls). Mike Abbott is his usual coked-out, wide-eyed 
   self, chewing up the scenery in every frame he's in (yet his brutal 
   rape scenes seem nothing more than gentle lovemaking sessions!). His 
   death scene, where General Tengga stabs him with a spear just above 
   his groin, is one of the film's bloody highlights. As usual with most 
   Indonesian films, the English dubbing is horrendous and hilarious 
   (although whoever dubbed Abbott's voice at least tried to match his 
   lip movements), the violence is over-the-top and any depiction of the 
   Dutch is not in the best light (even the Dutch women are portrayed as 
   upper-class cunts), but considering Indonesia's history, this is to 
   be expected. Another winner from Producer Gope T. Samtani and Rapi 
   Films, Indonesia's main purveyors of sleazy entertainment. This never

   It's post-apocalypse time once again, yet this American-made film is 
   just different enough to hold your interest. After the 
   &quot;Collapse&quot;, the world is a shell of it's former self, as 
   all the cities have become nothing but burned-out slums with 
   barbarian nomads preying on what's left of normal human society. One 
   such family, the Colts, have saved up enough money to move into a 
   &quot;Safehaven&quot;, a self-contained city block where society is 
   civil and everyone lives in peace and harmony. Or so they thought. 
   Once the Colts, which includes father Ben (William Beckwith), mother 
   Janet (Sammi Gavich), son Jeff (John Wittenbauer) and daughter 
   Natalie (Mollie O'Mara), make it to Safehaven 186, they will discover 
   that it's rules and regulations are no better (if not worse) than 
   living on the outside. As a matter of fact, Safehaven 186 is a living 
   nightmare, as it's leader, Mayor McGee (Marcus Powell), runs the 
   place with an iron fist. When Ben and <A HREF="escape_from_safehaven_1988b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/escape from safehaven vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>his
    family are forced to watch two Safehaven residents being hanged for 
   minor infractions, Ben speaks out against the injustice, which 
   doesn't sit well with Mayor McGee and his goons and it puts his 
   family's lives in jeopardy. Mayor McGee sends his goons to arrest the 
   Colts at their apartment (which looks like a hovel) and they grab 
   everyone except Jeff, who is out doing some shopping. Ben is falsely 
   charged with assaulting an officer, head goon Preacher (Roy 
   MacArthur), and sentenced to death, so Jeff has to find a way to 
   rescue his father and the rest of his family (Mom is put in a cell 
   and Natalie is sent to a whorehouse for training). Enter Pierce (Rick 
   Gianasi; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#RiotOn42ndSt.">RIOT ON 42ND ST.</A></B> 
   - 1987), a loner in the best <B><A HREF="mad_max_1979.htm">MAD MAX</A></B> 
   (1979) tradition, who previously saved Natalie from being raped when 
   the Colts were making their way to Safehaven 186 and now helps Jeff 
   save his family, with an assist from a blind black man (Damon 
   Clarke), who, it turns out, is not blind at all, but is the leader of 
   an underground rebel force out to stop the oppression. Complicating 
   matters is an internal power struggle between Mayor McGee and 
   Preacher (Preacher believes the Mayor is being too soft!), but Pierce 
   will use this power grab to his advantage to rescue Ben from the 
   hangman's noose, Janet from a prison cell and Natalie from Preacher 
   and whorehouse madam Mama's (Jessica Dublin) greasy hands. It's not 
   all going to be shits and giggles, though, as Pierce is captured and 
   tortured, the blind man killed and the underground rebel force 
   exposed. Pierce is also harboring a secret from his past, which will 
   come into play during the finale, when he and Preacher face-off for a 
   final confrontation.&nbsp; This ultra-low-budget post-nuke actioner, 
   co-directed and co-written by Brian Thomas Jones (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rejuvenator">THE

    TERROR</A></B> - 1988; and also Director of Photography here) is an 
   enjoyable seedy little film with a lot of ideas on it's mind, but not 
   a lot of money to show it. I admire a film that shows how life in a 
   supposedly &quot;safe&quot; environment may actually be worse that 
   life on the outside, where scavengers roam the slum-ridden landscape 
   and life isn't pretty. What this film lacks in budget, it more than 
   makes up for in sheer chutzpah, as the real scavengers are shown to 
   be those that are in authority; corrupt to the point of no longer 
   acting humane. That's not to say that this film is all lofty 
   ambitions, though. There are plenty of exploitative elements on view, 
   including Pierce being tortured by a topless chick in a dominatrix 
   outfit, some bad martial arts tomfoolery, a smattering of gore 
   (including a scene of the blind man being crucified), gunfights and 
   lots of people with big 80's hair and clothing. While we're not 
   talking Shakespeare here, <B><A HREF="escape_from_safehaven_1989.htm">ESCAPE
    FROM SAFEHAVEN</A></B> is just unusual enough to make it worthwhile 
   viewing, as long as you can forgive it's extremely low budget. Filmed 
   in New York City (look closely during the rooftop scenes and you'll 
   notice that the city is not as empty as this film wants you to 
   believe it is). The infectious opening and closing song, &quot;Law Of

   is shocking because, up to this point in the film, it seems Danny is 
   going to be one of the film's major heroes), wounds Meredith in the 
   side (using her Marine training, she stops the bleeding by sticking a 
   tampon in the wound and sealing it with duct tape!) and kills another 
   secondary passenger by shooting her in the neck. As the film 
   progresses, the passengers grab control of the bus, crashing it into 
   an out-of-the-way auto junkyard, where our ragtag group must batten 
   down the hatches and defend themselves against the ever-growing 
   number of bikers, while bickering among themselves and discovering 
   each other's secrets. To give away any more would be doing a 
   disservice to first-time viewers. Let's just say that nearly everyone 
   has their own hidden talents that will be needed to be put into use 
   if they are to survive the night.&nbsp; Similar in tone to John 
   Carpenter's <B><A HREF="#AssaultPrecinct1376">ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13</A></B> 
   (1976), in that the bikers depicted here are mainly faceless entities 
   with no dialogue, but director Scott Ziehl (<B><A HREF="earth_vs_the_spider_2001.htm">EARTH

   passengers some interesting back stories and integrating those back 
   stories into advancing the plot. While the middle section of the film 
   falters somewhat (there seems to be too much arguing amongst the 
   cast), it does pick up steam once the passengers decide to work 
   together and begin to kick some biker ass. That's not to say that 
   they don't suffer some casualties of their own, as Ziehl is not 
   afraid to kill off some&nbsp; major characters in gruesome ways. 
   There are also some welcome bits of humor, most of it coming from 
   Spanish-speaking passenger Mr. Vargas (Everett Sifuentes), who no one 
   understands, yet he manufactures a weapon that comes in quite handy 
   (and is used in one of the film's stand-out deaths). While much of 
   the violence consists of bullet hits to the head or other 
   extremities, there's also a nasty machete throat-slashing, various 
   arrow impalements, bloody shotgun blasts and a crowd-pleasing killing 
   by Lea Thompson (whom I never liked as an actress, but she's bloody 
   good here), who kills a nasty female biker while 
   half-pleading/half-proudly declaring &quot;I have children!&quot; It 
   will send shivers up your spine. All-in-all, not a bad way to spend 
   90 minutes. Nothing earth-shaking, just solid entertainment with a 
   sense of heart and soul missing from most genre films of this type. A 
   Peace Arch Home Entertainment DVD Release. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    EXPENDABLES</A><A NAME="Expendables1988"></A> (1988) -</B> This 
   Vietnam War action film opens with Captain Rosello (Anthony Finetti) 
   leading a platoon into an enemy village and destroying a munitions 
   dump, but not before taking on heavy casualties. When the mission is 
   completed, the only people left alive are Rosello, another soldier 
   and a baby that Rosello rescues after he is forced to kill it's 
   traitorous mother. Back at base camp, Rosello is informed by his 
   Commanding Officer that no other soldiers want to work with him 
   because every mission he leads, very few soldiers come back alive. 
   Rosello is then ordered to lead a squad of misfits, con men and 
   criminals on his latest mission, but first he has to get them to work 
   together as a team. That won't be easy. This group of roustabouts 
   have more issues than National Geographic. There's the wise-mouthed 
   black demolitions expert, Jackson (Kevin Duffis); deeply religious 
   Bible-thumper with the prophetic name Elijah Lord (Loren Haynes, who 
   also wrote and sings the film's closing tune); full-fledged bigot 
   Richter (Jeff Griffith), who looks at Jackson and says, &quot;Apes 
   ain't my brothers!&quot;; hard-partying pothead Sterling (Peter 
   Nelson); and the mysterious Navarro (Eric Hahn). Before you can say <B><A HREF="dirty_dozen_1967.htm">THE
    DIRTY DOZEN</A></B> (1967), Captain Rosello is seen whipping the 
   squad into shape in typical 80's fashion, while we watch the members 
   try to work out their differences, especially between Rich<A HREF="expendables_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/expendables vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="270" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ter
    and Jackson (When Richter says, &quot;I smell a nigger!&quot;, it 
   leads to a lengthy fistfight between the two). Rosello finally leads 
   his men on their first mission: Capturing a Viet Cong Colonel 
   (Filipino staple Vic Diaz, in a much larger role than usual) and 
   blowing up an enemy bridge. They somehow manage to complete their 
   objectives, but they aren't yet working together as a squad (Rosello 
   tells his Commanding Officer after the mission, &quot;They can't even 
   wipe their own asses!&quot;, to which his C.O. responds, &quot;Then 
   you wipe for them!&quot;). Slowly but surely, everyone begins working 
   together as a team and learn to put their differences aside. After 
   taking a major casualty on their second mission, Roselli decides to 
   take his men for a night out on the town, which leads to a 
   prerequisite bar fight with a bunch of drunken Marines (one is 
   portrayed by an uncredited Nick Nicholson). They all get thrown into 
   the brig, but when enemy forces invade the hospital to free their 
   captured Colonel and take some female nurses hostage, Captain Roselli 
   and the Expendables swing into action in what will turn out to be 
   their most dangerous (and fatal) mission. For the first time, Captain 
   Roselli experiences the hollow experience of victory in the face of 
   sacrifice.&nbsp; This is Filipino director Cirio H. Santiago's third 
   80's Vietnam War film, after <B><A HREF="#EyeOfTheEagle">EYE OF THE EAGLE</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="action.htm#BehindEnemyLines87">BEHIND ENEMY LINES</A></B> 
   (both 1987), and while it offers nothing new to the genre (all the 
   characters are straight out of Stereotypes 101), it still manages to 
   be strangely compelling, not to mention action-packed. Santiago 
   always staffs his films with his usual cast of professionals and <B><A HREF="expendables_1988c.htm">THE
    EXPENDABLES</A></B> benefits from it. As a matter of fact, the 
   weakest actor here is Anthony Finetti as Captain Rosello, who is a 
   newcomer to the Santiago universe. Nearly everyone else, from 
   Rosello's Commanding Officer (William Steis; the star of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DemonOfParadise">DEMON
    OF PARADISE</A></B> - 1987) to all the members of the Expendables, 
   have appeared in numerous Santiago productions, sometimes taking-on 
   leading and secondary roles and other times appearing in uncredited 
   bit parts. That is why most of Santiago's films, whether good or bad, 
   are at least well-acted. <B>THE EXPENDABLES</B> also contains it's 
   fair share of gunfights, explosions and bloody bullet squibs as well 
   as a surprising amount of female nudity (much of it full-frontal), 
   way more than usual for films of this type. The script, by Philip 
   Alderton, is generic war action stuff, but I did like the inclusion 
   of the deeply religious character, Lord, into the mix. It allowed for 
   a couple of unusual sequences, such as when Lord pulls his gun on and 
   threatens to kill a naked gook prostitute when she rubs her naked 
   body on him. He also turns out to be the voice of reason during the 
   final attack set-piece, basically telling the rest of the gang, 
   &quot;Hell, do you want me leading you or do you want the reluctant 
   pothead?&quot; The group picks the pothead. As much as I despise 
   organized religion in general, it's refreshing to watch a film that 
   puts a human face to someone devoted to their god, without pandering 
   or preaching. If you are a fan of war action films, you will probably 
   enjoy this. This is the first film produced by Christopher R. 
   Santiago, Cirio's son. Christoper would go on to produce many of his 
   father's later films. Also starring David Light, Leah Navarro, Don 
   Wilson, Jim Moss, Don Holtz, Greg Rocero, Janet Price and Cory Sperry 
   as Strzalkowski, an in-joke to frequent Santiago collaborator Henry 
   Strzalkowski, who had nothing to do with this film. Available on VHS

   who are pinned-down by the enemy in the jungle. Sgt. Stratton fires 
   his pistol in one hand and an AK-47 in the other, Cpl. Leung keeps 
   the enemy at bay with his automatic rifle and Cpl. Ransom shoots his 
   Winchester rifle from the hip. All three of them are crack shots, 
   kill all the VC and lead the American soldiers to a waiting 
   helicopter. We then witness a group of traitorous American soldiers, 
   led by Sgt. B.O. Rattner (Ed Crick), invade the headquarters of 
   Company C, laying waste to all the buildings and killing all the 
   American soldiers stationed there. Col. Stark (Mike Monty) and Capt. 
   Carter (William Steis) assign Stratton, Ransom and Leung on a mission 
   to kill enemy Col. Trang (Vic Diaz) as he is traveling by train 
   through the mountains. The trio sneak on-board the train, kill Trang 
   and are forced to steal some enemy motorcycles and drive to safety 
   when, for some reason, Capt. Carter never picks them up by 
   helicopter. When the trio get back to headquarters, they <A HREF="eye_of_the_eagle_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/eye of the eagle vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>make
    sure to voice their displeasure to Carter and then get into a bar 
   fight with Sgt. Maddox (David Light) and his men (who were supposed 
   to back them up on the last mission) when someone calls Leung a 
   &quot;gook&quot;. Meanwhile, journalist Chris Chandler (Cec Verrell; <B><A HREF="#Silk1986">SILK</A></B> 
   - 1986) has discovered the secret location of the &quot;Lost 
   Command&quot;, a squad of rogue soldiers that are officially listed 
   as AWOL or MIA, commanded by, you guessed it, Sgt. B.O. Rattner. When 
   Chandler is discovered taking photos of the secret location, Rattner 
   orders his men to kill her and get the film. That's not going to be 
   easy, because Chandler's assistant, Lol Pot (Tony Beso), is also the 
   leader of a local tribe of spear and bow-carrying freedom fighters. 
   When Chandler makes it back to her base camp, she manages to get one 
   radio message out before Rattner and his men appear to destroy the 
   camp. Chandler is saved, but loses her camera and the film. When 
   Stratton finds out that Rattner is involved, he has Chandler lead 
   him, Ransom and Leung to the location of the Lost Command. You see, 
   it turns out that Rattner murdered Stratton's brother years earlier 
   and it's payback time. It looks like it's going to be a hot time in 
   the old jungle tonight, especially after it's revealed that Capt. 
   Carter is in cahoots with Rattner. When Rattner kidnaps and tortures 
   Ransom, Stratton and Chandler race to the Lost Command headquarters 
   to save him. Will they get there in time?&nbsp; I'm not going to 
   pretend that this film is nothing but a low-budget <B>PLATOON</B> 
   (1986) rip-off, but it's still damn entertaining. Director/producer 
   Cirio H. Santiago, working with a script by frequent Santiago 
   collaborators Joseph Zucchero and Nigel Hogge, has fashioned a 
   fast-paced, mindless actioner that's basically a non-stop series of 
   action set-pieces connected by the barest of plots. Brett Clark is 
   stiff as a piece of one inch-thick plywood and Robert Patrick, who 
   would appear as the same character in Santiago's next Nam film, <B><A HREF="action.htm#BehindEnemyLines87">BEHIND
    ENEMY LINES</A></B> (1987), only this time as the lead, mugs for the 
   camera and screams out his lines. Luckily, we don't watch these films 
   for the acting talent and Santiago doesn't disappoint when it comes 
   to the carnage. People are shot in the head (our trio's preferred 
   method of disposing of the enemy), blown-up or riddled with automatic 
   gunfire and Santiago also includes a shot of a man on fire, a 
   recurring gag in nearly all his films. I'm still trying to figure out 
   why Ransom dresses like a Southern rebel from the Civil War and why 
   he was allowed to bring a Winchester rifle and a Colt pistol to 
   Vietnam, but I suppose it's best not to dwell on such matters. 
   Unfortunately, Cec Verrell keeps her clothes on throughout, but 
   there's a brief shot of a topless prostitute during the bar fight. If 
   you like war action films, <B>EYE OF THE EAGLE</B> is a good way to 
   spend 82 minutes. Two unrelated sequels followed, <B><A HREF="eye_of_the_eagle_2_1988.htm">EYE

   accident at all, but some thugs who gas the two guards and&nbsp; 
   drive the van to a secret location. Paul doesn't know what is going 
   on, but Gloria (Lucretia Love; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE
    EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974) tells him to be patient, 
   everything will be explained shortly. She drives him to the palatial 
   home of Professor Orson Kr&uuml;ger (Van Johnson; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#PriceOfPower1969">THE
    PRICE OF POWER</A></B> - 1969) and he tries to make a deal with 
   Paul. It seem the Professor financed the job that Paul was pulling 
   when he got captured. He was shot during a diamond robbery and left 
   on the street for the cops to capture by his two partners. The 
   Professor was supposed to get two million dollars worth of diamond 
   and Paul was supposed to get $200,000 for the job, but his partners 
   stiffed the both of them and Paul got 20 years in jail because of it 
   (he was only on year five when he was &quot;rescued&quot;). The 
   Professor tells Paul that he wants him to get even with his partners, 
   but only on his terms. He knows Paul is a hothead and only wants the 
   money due to him and to get even with his partners, but he tells Paul 
   if he doesn't follow his instructions to the letter, the deal is off. 
   Paul agrees and the next thing we see is the Paul got a nosejob and 
   changed the color of his hair, to fool the police (who are looking 
   for him) and also his partners (He originally had a pug nose 
   [blatantly fake-looking] and blonde hair, but now he has his original 
   God-given nose and black hair). His name is now &quot;Frank 
   Vogel&quot; and he has a forged passport, supplied by the Professor, 
   to prove it. The Professor tells Paul that one of his partners, Mark 
   (Teodoro Corr&agrave;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FiveDolls1970">FIVE
    DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON</A></B> - 1970), is in Marseilles, France, 
   so he and Gloria (who is his constant companion, on the Professor's 
   orders), fly to Marseilles (Paul has a few close calls at the 
   airport) and Paul/Frank sees Mark at an estate auction, but there'a 
   also a photographer, Harpett (Goffredo Unger; <B><A HREF="thunder_warrior_series_1983-1988.htm">THUNDER</A></B> 
   - 1983), who snaps some pictures of Paul without his knowledge. Paul 
   calls Mark and tells him that he wants his money and Mark agrees to 
   pay him. Paul tells him if he tries any funny business, he's a dead 
   man. So what does Mark do? That's right, funny business, sending two 
   of his assassins to kill Paul at their agreed meeting place, a 
   lighthouse. Paul ends up killing the two assassins and, rather than 
   waiting for the Professor's instructions (we never find out what they 
   are!), Paul goes into Mark's office (he's now an art appraiser) with 
   a gun and demands the $200,000 owed to him (The first time they were 
   supposed to meet, Mark sent the police to a restaurant to check 
   everyone's passports, hoping they would snag him, but Gloria saves 
   his ass.). Mark sees that Paul means business, so he opens up his 
   large walk-in safe and gives him the money, over half a million 
   dollars, but he won't tell Paul where the second partner is, forcing 
   Paul to lock him in the safe (even when he gives him the location!). 
   Unknown to Paul, Harpett was watching the whole thing and when Paul 
   leaves, he tries to free Mark, but he doesn't know the combination 
   (they can't hear each other through the safe's steel walls) and Mark 
   dies of asphyxiation (Way too quickly to be believable).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Professor is not happy with Paul for not following his 
   instructions (whatever they were!) and takes the money away from him 
   and has Gloria deposit it in a bank. He gives Paul one more chance to 
   follow his directions to the letter. Mark told Paul that his second 
   partner, Hans Fischer (Klaus Kinski; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WebSpider1971">WEB
    OF THE SPIDER</A></B> - 1971), a.k.a. &quot;The Polack&quot;, is in 
   Algiers, so he and Gloria head there, the Professor providing them a 
   safe place to stay when they are there (The Professor knows their 
   every move). What they don't know is that Harpett has phoned Hans, 
   telling him he would sell him photos of Paul for $20,000. Hans agrees 
   to pay, but crooks can't be trusted and two of Hans' men meet Harpett 
   at a bar, take the photos and garrot him in his own car. Hans now 
   knows Paul's new face, but Paul doesn't care, he just wants the money 
   that is due to him. Just like Mark, Hans tries to kill Paul, but he 
   survives, which leads to a shootout in a boatyard, Paul gunning down 
   Hans' men and then getting into a fight with Hans, impaling him in 
   the torso with a baling hook, killing him. Gloria, who has been 
   trying to get into bed with Paul from the beginning (Paul says to 
   her, &quot;Sorry, but I don't like to start with the crumbs from the 
   Professor's table!&quot;), finally gets her wish and they make love. 
   Good thing, too, because more of Hans' men have taken her prisoner 
   and are holding her at Hans' house. Paul rescues her and when they 
   get back to their villa, the Professor is waiting for them and he's 
   not happy. He pulls a gun on Paul, telling him he cannot trust him 
   since he refuses to follow his directions (What the hell were 
   they????), so he has to die. As he is about to pull the trigger, a 
   shot rings out. That's right, Gloria, who is now madly in love with 
   Paul shoots and kills the Professor, but not before he puts a bullet 
   into her. Both the Professor and Gloria die and the police surround 
   the house (the Professor called them previously to find Paul's body). 
   Paul is then gunned down by the police and the last thought to go 
   through his mind is the vision of the failed diamond robbery, where 
   Mark gunned him down and left him there for the police to capture. <A HREF="eye_of_the_spider_1971.htm#GermanTitle"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/eye of the spider german poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Only

    Like I said earlier, the plot is very confusing and nothing is 
   explained fully. Just when it seems like the Professor is about to 
   tell Paul why he has to die, he starts talking German! If you don't 
   understand German, you are shit out of luck, because even the English 
   subtitles don't translate what he says. Talk about stiffing the 
   viewer! There is also a confusing bit of business when the Professor 
   gives Gloria a gift, telling her, &quot;This is the last link in the 
   chain. Nothing exists to compromise your freedom.&quot; It looks to 
   be a silver ring and the Professor then takes it back, saying it is 
   best left with him. We know he is blackmailing her, but what does the 
   ring stand for? We are never told. That's the problem with this 
   entire film, nothing is explained. It's basically Paul killing 
   everyone he comes in contact with and eventually it destroys his 
   life. The &quot;disguise&quot; Paul wears in the beginning, which is 
   supposed to be the &quot;real&quot; him, is so fake-looking, it's 
   laughable. Bushy blonde eyebrows, moustache, beard, blonde wig and a 
   putty nose that wouldn't fool a blind person, which is probably why 
   we never see Paul get the nosejob, he just miraculously is 
   &quot;Frank&quot; without any healing time (rhinoplasty takes a long 
   time to heal!). Director Roberto Bianchi Montero (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE

    friend, a fight ensues where the diamond first falls into the 
   cleavage of Mr. Anlucky's mistress, then a bucket of ice (what are 
   the odds?) and, finally, getting tossed out the window of the 
   highrise building and landing on the roof of a shack (more on that 
   later). Kenny and his tiny friend escape (the little guy takes a dive 
   out of the same highrise window and lands in a chicken coop!) and 
   everyone, both good guys and bad, vow to find the diamond. Meanwhile, 
   back at police headquarters, the son of the dead diamond owner is 
   able to identify Kenny's mug shot, so the police brass assign Captain 
   Ben Daniel (Joe Samenchai) and Lieutenant Phyllis (Den Dokprodoo) to 
   go undercover and find Kenny and the diamond. Kenny retrieves the 
   diamond when he finds it on the roof of a shack occupied by seven 
   male midgets and their normal-sized sister (a funny take-off on Snow 
   White and the Seven Dwarves), but Mr. Anlucky's goons show up and a 
   comical chase ensues where the diamond once again gets lost when it 
   falls into an ice-making machine (again, what are the odds?). Kenny 
   cuts a deal with Ben and Phyllis to find the diamond if no charges 
   will be filed against him or his seven little friends, while Mr. 
   Anlucky is getting heat from his Big Boss (Craig James) to find the 
   diamond or else. Kenny finds time to fall in love with the dwarves' 
   sister, but when one of the dwarves accidentally swallows the diamond 
   when he finds it, he is kidnapped by Mr. Anlucky's men in a hospital 
   operating room (the doctors were just about to remove it). The sudden 
   appearance of a bald monk, who tells Kenny, Ben and Phyllis that he 
   must return the diamond to the temple it was stolen from before the 
   diamond's curse goes into effect (something about death to all those 
   that touch or possess it), puts pressure on everyone to find the 
   diamond and quickly. Kenny uses his parachuting skills to steal the 
   diamond in mid-air, just as Mr. Anlucky tries to deliver it to the 
   Big Boss. When the Big Boss kidnaps the seven dwarves and their 
   sister in exchange for the diamond, Kenny will once again have to use 
   his hang-gliding skills to save them in the explosive finale.&nbsp; 
   This insanely comic action film, directed by Chalong Pakdeevichit 
   (better known as Chalong Pakdivijit and P. Chalong) and written by 
   Bancherd Thavee, never takes itself too seriously, but that doesn't 
   mean that the violence is toned-down in the least. People are shot 
   point-blank, stabbed, the dwarves are tossed around like rag dolls 
   (god bless 'em, because they really take multiple beatings on-screen) 
   and there are some well-done and exciting stunts on view, including 
   Kenny's parachuting stunt and a jitney chase where Kenny and all 
   seven dwarves climb into one small jitney (like a clown car at the 
   circus) and are chased around the streets of Bangkok by the bad guys. 
   This film may be nothing but nonsense about a diamond that keeps 
   exchanging hands, but it is entertaining nonsense, full of action, 
   violence, comedy and, above all, hilarious English dubbing that will 
   have you howling with laughter, especially when any of the dwarves 
   open their mouths to speak. They may be short on stature, but they

    The film opens with some members of a criminal organization being 
   killed by hired thugs. We are then at a large table, where the bosses 
   of said organization are having a meeting. One of the bosses, Joseph 
   (Erol Tas; <B><A HREF="hand_that_feeds_the_dead_1974.htm">THE HAND 
   THAT FEEDS THE DEAD</A></B> - 1974), has his four men gun down all

   his four men to kill a man with the unfortunate name of Tony Tiger

   &quot;Tony Tiger&quot;!; <B><A HREF="spy_smasher_1968.htm">SPY SMASHER</A></B>

   Tony is out hunting, the four men arrive at his house, kill all of 
   Tony's men (apparently, he is still involved in criminal activity) 
   and then take his wife and young son captive. Tony returns from 
   hunting and discovers all his men dead and then hears his wife 
   scream. He yells out, &quot;Do you know who I am? I'm Tony

   spread-eagle horizontally, hooks through his wrists! He is then made 
   to watch, as the four men kill his son (which could never be done in 
   any film made in the USA, as the men actually throw this boy around, 
   smack and punch him and use him as a football, kicking him and 
   tossing him to the other members!) and rape his wife, killing her. 
   They then pour kerosene over the dead wife and boy and set Tony's 
   home on fire, one of the men saying that Tony will make good 
   barbecue! Just when it looks like curtains for Tony, he is saved when 
   ex-lover Olga (Olga Petrova) arrives at his house and frees him. Olga 
   begs Tony to forget about what happened, but he tells her he will get 
   even with Joseph, telling her about his three best friends from the 
   army. They were so close, they promised each other that if any of 
   them were in trouble, they would drop everything to help (the 
   original title for this film was <B><A HREF="fighting_killer_1974.htm">DORT

    Margherito tries to take down one of the men at a Turkish bath, 
   where he ends up getting into a martial arts fight with some sweaty 
   goons (so badly staged you'll cough up a lung laughing!) and ends up 
   chasing his prey, only wearing a towel around his waist, through the 
   streets of Istanbul (the look on some people's faces, unaware of what 
   is going on, is priceless!), his prey getting hit and killed by a car 
   sent by Joseph. Brad then confronts another killer, who ends up 
   getting shot from a sniper (sent by Joseph) and dying before he can 
   spill the beans to him. Joe confronts another killer on a ski slope, 
   where it ends up on a chase on skis, his prey dying by falling over a 
   cliff. Finally, Tony confronts the final killer, but he, too, is 
   killed by one of Joseph's hired killers, but not before he tells Tony 
   that he was sent by Joseph to kill his wife and son (None of this 
   makes any sense since Tony already knew Joseph was involved!). The 
   finale finds Tony and his three friends invading Joseph's 
   well-guarded villa, where the foursome discover that it wasn't Joseph 
   who sent the men to kill Tony's wife and son, it was Olga! It seems 
   she wanted Tony for herself, so she hired the four killers to murder 
   the wife and child and to set fire to the house, making her look like 
   a hero in Tony's eyes so he will fall in love with her. The film ends 
   in a wild shoot-out, where Tony, Joseph and Olga are shot dead and 
   his three friends survive, once again agreeing to help each other in 
   times of need.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This wild and wacky actioner should fail miserably, but if you have 
   watched any other Turkish actioners in your life (such as <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Lion Man">LION
    MAN</A></B> - 1975), you will know that believability is not their 
   strongest suit. When people get shot here, all they do is grab their 
   chest and fall to the ground, no need for bloody bullet squibs, yet 
   when Tony is hanged spread-eagle by his wrists and feet, we see hooks 
   protruding out of his skin! Add to that Tony's uncanny ability to 
   jump high distances without the aid of a trampoline and you have one 
   strange flick. Particularly memorable is the scene where one of the 
   four killers tries to run Tony over in his car. Tony simply jumps in 
   the air and ends up in the killer's front seat and they continue 
   fighting while the convertible continues driving down the road, 
   ending up hitting a tree and Tony is ejected out of the car, landing 
   on his feet! And nearly 90% of the male actors here sport Charles 
   Bronson-like mustaches! Co-directors Giulio Giuseppe Negri and Yilmaz 
   Atadeniz, who, together, use the name &quot;Jerry Mason&quot;; (<B><A HREF="special_squad_shoots_on_sight_1976.htm">SPECIAL
    SQUAD: SHOOTS ON SIGHT</A></B> - 1976) have no problem showing Tony 
   defying the laws of physics, as he is able to leap over high walls 
   and deliver high drop-kicks in tight places. If you like your action 
   films fast and furious, with a touch of mind-bending fantasy, look no 
   further than this flick. You can thank me later. I found this 
   streaming for free on Amazon Prime. It's only 78 minutes long, so it 
   doesn't take up a lot of your time, yet the film moves so fast, 
   you'll think the film is shorter than it actually is. It should also 
   be noted that Richard Harrison looks like he is having the time of 
   his life, as he is smiling through most of the film, even when he is 
   fighting. It's that type of thing which makes this film so 
   infectious, so catch its disease! Also starring Alicia Leoni, Ferita

    THE KICKBOXER</A><A NAME="FightTheKickboxer"></A> (1992) -</B> Harry 
   Wells (Steve Brettingham) and Rough Tati (Nick Brandon) are not only 
   best friends and champion kickboxers, they also put on fixed matches 
   with each other to make big bucks on the gambling circuit (it's hard 
   to lose money when you already know who the winner is going to be). 
   Rough wants to expand his crime empire to include arms smuggling, 
   prostitution and drug dealing (you know, the trifecta of crime), but 
   Harry doesn't agree and tells Rough that he's quitting the operation 
   after the next fight. Before anything else can be said, the cops raid 
   their headquarters, forcing Rough and Harry to split up, with Harry 
   donning a disguise (if you count wearing a white golf cap a 
   disguise!) and escaping with a satchel containing all of Rough and 
   Harry's money. Rough is watching the action from a rooftop when he is 
   startled to see Harry being arrested with no resistance by a single 
   cop, who says to Harry, &quot;Nice job!&quot; before slapping on the 
   handcuffs. Is it possible Harry was responsible for setting up the 
   police raid? It doesn't originally look like it, as Harry is <A HREF="fight_the_kickboxer_1992b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/fight the kickboxer poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>thrown
    in prison and shares a cell with a bunch of Filipinos in what is 
   obviously a totally different film (Did I forget to mention that this 
   is another cut-and-paste actioner from director Godfrey Ho [using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Vincent Leung&quot;] and producer Joseph Lai? Sorry 
   about that! When the interest in ninjas waned, Ho and Lai turned 
   their attention to the kickboxing genre [thanks to Jean-Claude Van 
   Damme] during the early 90's.). Not only does Harry not appear in a 
   single frame with the Filipino cast (he does get an American and a 
   Chinese man as his new footage adversaries), but when one of the cast 
   members says to Harry, &quot;So you're the new guy, huh? I hope 
   you're not a fucking queer!&quot;, you'll be scratching your head and 
   wondering: Wouldn't they rather he was queer? Anyway, Rough has sent 
   word to the prison inmates to make Harry's life a living hell, so 
   while he is pounding rocks with a sledgehammer in the prison quarry 
   (why does every prison in films have a quarry?), the American and 
   Chinese inmates attack Harry with shovels (Harry gets pounded on the 
   side of the head with a shovel, rolls down a hill, smashes his head 
   against a boulder and then gets up like nothing happened, continuing 
   to fight his two opponents!). The inmates from the older footage 
   start a riot and Harry escapes, along with ruthless killer Mason 
   (Filipino staple George Estregan, here using the name &quot;Boy 
   Lenn&quot;) and some of his prison friends. The film then splits into 
   two entire different entities: The newly-shot footage of Harry 
   fighting a bunch of Rough's hoods every 15 to 20 minutes until his 
   inevitable showdown with Rough in the ring; and the film proper, an 
   unreleased Filipino revenge actioner where ex-cop Jason (Willi Kindo) 
   rejoins the force to capture Mason and his men. Mason was responsible 
   for the murder of Jason's wife, leaving Jason a widower and a single 
   father. Jason joins forces with his old partner Mando (Mando Iva), 
   while Harry goes to wife Joey's (Hannah Crawford) house, but she 
   refuses to go with him. The remainder of the film finds Jason and 
   Mando getting into a series of shootouts and martial arts fights in 
   their pursuit of Mason, while Harry teams up with black kickboxer 
   Billy (Rex Jackson) as they go after Rough and fight in a kickboxing 
   match worth one million dollars.&nbsp; This pastiche film contains 
   all the elements we've come to expect from these Godfrey Ho/Joseph 
   Lai collaborations for Lai's IFD Film And Arts Limited production 
   company: Bad intercutting of old and new footage (The most obvious 
   being when Harry is first put in the prison cell and even the prison 
   bunk beds don't match! But there's a shootout in an auto junkyard 
   that runs a close second.); hilarious and racist English dubbing 
   (When a cop spots Billy's photo in Harry folder, he says, &quot;Who 
   is this nigger?&quot; and then this bit of wisdom; &quot;Not every 
   scumbag could have a big fuckin' car and not every scumbag wants to 
   be a fuckin' scumbag!&quot;); and a rejiggered story that tries to 
   accommodate both old and new footage, but the new inserts are so 
   obvious, it becomes funny in its ridiculousness. As usual, the film 
   proper is more interesting than the newly-shot footage and contains 
   bloody shootouts (lots of bloody bullet squibs) and violence, while 
   the new inserts contain kickboxing matches in a ring so small, even 
   dwarves would complain about it. <B><A HREF="fight_the_kickboxer_1992c.htm">FIGHT

   to end. The film opens with Sergeant Vincent Deacon (Richard Young) 
   leading his men in an assault on a Vietcong camp in the jungles of 
   Laos in 1972. After gunning nearly everyone down and blowing 
   everything up (even chopping-off a head or two), Sgt. Deacon captures 
   the traitorous Will Slater (John Dresden) and turns him over to the 
   military authorities. Slater curses at Deacon, telling him that he 
   will &quot;see him in Hell&quot; as he is being led away. Cut to 
   present day (well, 1984) Los Angeles. Vince Deacon is now a SWAT team 
   leader and we watch him nearly single-handedly take on a warehouse 
   full of armed thugs (one of them is portrayed by an uncredited Donald 
   Gibbs, &quot;Ogre&quot; in <B><A HREF="revenge_of_the_nerds_1984.htm">REVENGE
    OF THE NERDS</A></B> - 1984) and saves the hostage inside. Deacon 
   also has a beautiful wife, Jenny (Christine L. Tudor), and a young 
   son named Steven (E. Danny Murphy). When a street gang, egged-on by 
   Slater (who escaped from military prison and has been living on the 
   lam), break into Deacon's house and try to kill him and his family, 
   Deacon manages to kill most of them, which infuriates Slater. To show 
   his appreciation, Deacon's captain suspends him from the force for 
   being &quot;excessive&quot; (What?). Deacon and his family decide to 
   spend his suspension time by camping at a lake in the mountains, 
   where Deacon can clear his head, go fishing and reconnect with his 
   family. Things take a sudden bad turn when Jenny and Steven are 
   killed when the fishing boat they are on explodes, thanks to a bomb 
   Slater placed there the night before. Now a widower, Deacon goes on a 
   one-man mission to find the killers of his family, tearing-up bars 
   and shoving patrons' heads in toilets looking for clues. Deacon quits 
   the police force for good and begins putting heat on the street 
   gangs. Slater and some gang members leave L.A. and hide out in the 
   small town of Pinesville, where the sheriff, Warren Slater (Kaz 
   Garas), happens to be Slater's brother. Deacon goes to his old 
   commanding officer, Colonel Joshua Cain (John Ericson), with a piece 
   of the detonator he found at the scene of his family's death. When it 
   comes back that it could only have come from Slater, Deacon heads to

   the 80's, but he always found a way to put his distinct signature on 
   them. This one opens as a straight war actioner, then turns into an 
   urban crime drama, which then turns into a revenge melodrama. The 
   final twenty minutes are lifted almost directly from <B>FIRST BLOOD</B>,
    as Deacon lays waste to the town of Pinesville and then Sheriff 
   Warren and his posse hunt him down in the forest, with disasterous 
   results. There's boobytraps, do-it-yourself bullet removal (followed 
   by a &quot;cauterizing the wound with a flaming log&quot; scene) and, 
   finally, the National Guard are called in. Unlike Rambo, Deacon 
   begins killing everyone who crosses his path. Colonel Trautman, er, 
   Cain is brought in to talk Deacon into giving up. Let's just say the 
   final shot leaves no room for a sequel. What's interesting about <B><A HREF="final_mission_1984c.htm">FINAL
    MISSION</A></B> is the way Santiago treats some of his characters, 
   especially Kaz Garas' (he was also in Santiago's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Naked Vengeance">NAKED
    VENGEANCE</A></B> [1985], amongst others) portrayal of Sheriff 
   Warren Slater. He is a man in the middle, not aware of his brother's 
   traitorous war record and yet, deep down inside, he knows his brother 
   is not quite right in the head, but he's still his brother and he'll 
   do whatever it takes to protect him. While some may find this film a 
   little slow in spots, I found the deeper characterizations refreshing 
   (script by Joe Mari Avellana and Joseph Zucchero, frequent Santiago 
   collaborators) and Santiago doesn't skimp on the nudity (every woman 
   in this film has a topless scene), blood or action set-pieces. Sure, 
   this is nothing but a low-budget B-movie rip-off, but it is an 
   enjoyable one. Santiago directed <B><A HREF="action.htm#Devastator">THE
    DEVASTATOR</A></B> (1985) next, which features some of the same

   the beginning of this film. Also starring Jason Ross, Karen Ericson,

    is a mission, so David leads his men into the facility, bypassing 
   the electric fence and killing the few guards they come across. When 
   they burst into the meeting room and find it empty (It turns out the 
   meeting was rescheduled for tomorrow. Oops!), David and his men 
   become trapped inside the building when Tran Van Phu (Protracio Dee; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#HuntersGoldenCobra">HUNTERS
    OF THE GOLDEN COBRA</A></B> - 1982), the organizer of the meeting, 
   hears the gunshots and has his soldiers surround the meeting room, 
   killing everyone but David, Charles and Douglas. Complications arise 
   when David takes Tran's young daughter hostage and our heroic trio 
   escapes by Jeep using the little girl as a human shield. When their 
   Jeep hits a land mine, the little girl escapes, but one of the 
   soldiers (Is it David, Charles or Douglas? All we see is his boots.) 
   catches up with the little girl and puts a bullet in her forehead. 
   When Tran sees the dead body of his little girl, he vows revenge (And 
   rightly so. Marines should never use children as human shields!) and 
   tortures a recently captured Charles with electric shocks until he 
   gets information. The film suddenly shifts to five years later. The 
   war is over and David is living in Thailand with wife Kate (Kristine 
   Erlindson; <B><A HREF="action.htm#AmericanCommandos">AMERICAN COMMANDOS</A></B> 
   - 1984) and young son Paul. They get a visit from Charles (who David 
   hasn't seen since that fateful day), who invites the entire family to 
   a party on the beach. Once on the beach, they are attacked by a 
   motorcycle gang carrying automatic weapons and when a bloody and 
   battered David wakes up in a hospital, he's greeted by Douglas, who 
   tells him that Kate and Paul are missing and Charles was badly 
   beaten. Is there something more sinister going on here? When Kate and 
   Paul are found dead, both with a single bullet to their foreheads, 
   David must figure out which one of his friends is behind the murder 
   of his family. David may not like what he uncovers.&nbsp; Director 
   Teddy Page (using the pseudonym &quot;Tedd Hemingway&quot;) and 
   screenwriters Ron Davis and Jim Gaines keep this film moving at a 
   brisk pace by first making the film a war actioner complete with 
   gunfights and explosions and then changing-up the second half by 
   making it a mystery/revenge thriller. While it's not too hard to 
   figure out who killed Tran's little girl, it's a nice change of pace 
   from the normal war actioner, where the rest of the film would 
   normally be jungle warfare with lots of firefights and explosions. 
   Instead, we get a nice martial arts sequence where David must fight 
   for his life against some counterfeit Thai military recruits; an 
   invasion on the headquarters of Thailand's biggest drug kingpin, El 
   Chameleon (Hassim Hassam); David's multiple torture session 
   (including being dragged behind a galloping ox!) in Tran's hidden 
   jungle camp; and David's realization that his revenge is closer than 
   he thinks. Since this is Gary Daniels' first screen role, he's quite 
   stiff as an actor (he would loosen-up considerably in his future 
   films, especially the ones he did for PM Entertainment), but he is 
   fine in his action scenes. <B><A HREF="final_reprisal_1988b.htm">FINAL

   multi-caliber gun code-named Omega (It's part automatic rifle, 30

    gun, grenade launcher, bazooka and mini-missile launcher that also 
   has a built-in communications radio!). As Kaplan is showing a group 
   of soldiers how to use the Omega, they come under attack by rebel 
   forces and Kaplan and the Omega are taken prisoner. The film flashes 
   forward several years, where the dastardly Duffy Collins (Bruce 
   Baron; Page's <B><A HREF="#HuntersCrossing">HUNTER'S CROSSING</A></B> 
   - 1983, also starring Harrison) keeps hitting on Kaplan's wife Diane 
   (Ann Milhench, here billed as &quot;Ann Milhen&quot;), but she spurns 
   his advances and expensive gifts, still wishing instead that her 
   husband will return to her. Duffy wants Diane by any means possible, 
   so he hires someone to sneak into her house and abduct her. 
   Meanwhile, a group of U.S. commandos raid an enemy P.O.W. camp and 
   rescue Jack Kaplan. The only thing he wants is to be back in the 
   loving arms of his wife, but when her returns home to find her 
   missing and the house ransacked, he will revert to violence of every 
   type to get her back. A bartender at a local gin joint informs Kaplan 
   that &quot;a man with a golden hand&quot; (Ruel Vernal) may know 
   something about his missing wife, so Kaplan hooks-up with old friend 
   (and junkie) Digger (James Gaines; Page's <B><A HREF="action.htm#JungleRats">JUNGLE
    RATS</A></B> - 1987), who tells him the golden-handed dude's name is 
   Dennis and gives Kaplan his address. When Kaplan gets his hands on 
   Dennis and sticks a gun in his face after a short fight, he tells 
   Kaplan that a stripper named Eve (Gwendolyn Hung; <B><A HREF="#Ninja'sForce">NINJA'S
    FORCE</A></B> - 1984) hired him to abduct Diane. Kaplan confronts 
   Eve and she gives him the name of another person involved, but she 
   then calls Duffy after he leaves. Duffy orders Dennis to kill 
   everyone who knows about Diane's kidnapping, beginning with Digger 
   (Dennis thrusts his golden hand into Digger's stomach). Of course, 
   Kaplan gets blamed for Digger's death, so the police chief (a 
   blond-haired Mike Monty) assigns his best detective (Ronnie 
   Patterson) to apprehend Kaplan (The Chief says to the detective, 
   &quot;Be careful. He can turn an ordinary drinking straw into a 
   deadly weapon!&quot;). Eve follows Kaplan around and reports back to 
   Duffy, who sends an assassin (played by Sebastian Harrison, Richard's 
   son) to Kaplan's motel room dressed as a plumber (He knocks on the 
   door and when Kaplan asks him to identify himself, he says, &quot;I'm 
   a repairman. I was told there was a leak in the toilet!&quot;). 
   Kaplan watches him like a hawk, so the assassin is unable to plant a 
   bomb in the bathroom and is forced to leave unsuccessful in his task. 
   After several more attempts on Kaplan's life (by a guy wearing an eye 
   patch; another guy wearing a French beret; and yet another man 
   wielding a spike-tipped cane), Eve takes pity on him and discloses 
   the location where Diane is being held. Eve pays for her betrayal 
   with her life at the hands of Dennis and Kaplan kills Dennis in 
   retribution. Alas, Kaplan is too late to save his wife, as Duffy has 
   killed her for spurning his advances one too many times. Kaplan turns 
   Rambo in the final third of the film, killing those responsible for 
   Diane's death <A HREF="fireback_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/fireback dutch vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="287" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    then trying to avoid the police and a group of paid hunters out to 
   kill him.&nbsp; As with most action films directed by the late Teddy 
   Page (<B><A HREF="action.htm#PhantomSoldiers">PHANTOM SOLDIERS</A></B> 
   - 1987; <B><A HREF="action.htm#MovieInAction">MOVIE IN ACTION</A></B> 
   - 1987; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#FistOfSteel1991">FIST OF STEEL</A></B> 
   - 1991), the action comes at a fast and furious clip, but the 
   storyline (screenplay written by Timothy Jorge, which some say is a 
   pseudonym for Richard Harrison, a claim I find dubious at best) is a 
   complete jumbled mess with hilarious dialogue to match (Eve: &quot;You
    don't kill women, do you?&quot; Kaplan: &quot;Not yet!&quot;). I'm 
   still at a loss as to why Bruce Baron's face is obscured throughout 
   most of the film (either hidden by objects in the forefront or just 
   out of the frame) and then shown freely at other times. The only 
   logical reason I could come up with is that he wasn't available for 
   the entire shoot and a stand-in had to take his place several times. 
   The film's real capper comes when Diane is killed just as Kaplan 
   comes to rescue her, which turns the film into a completely different 
   bird (I really shouldn't be surprised by these sudden turn of events 
   in Filipino action flicks, because you should always expect the 
   unexpected). Jack suddenly turns into a combination Rambo/MacGuyver, 
   fashioning weapons and deadly contraptions out of junkyard scraps and 
   then takes on Duffy, his men and the entire police force (where he 
   has to kill innocent cops to survive). The final twenty minutes or so 
   is a direct steal of <B><A HREF="first_blood_1982.htm">FIRST BLOOD</A></B> 
   (1982), where an injured Kaplan hides out in the jungle and uses 
   booby traps, as well as his military training, to thin-out the mass 
   of people hunting him (Kaplan even cauterizes a wound using a red-hot 
   piece of metal, mimicking Stallone's gunpowder procedure in <B>BLOOD</B>).
    The sudden appearance of a black-clad ninja (Tony Aaron), who fights 
   Kaplan in a cave in the film finale, is just another piece of 
   unexpected icing on the cake. Those expecting a reappearance of the 
   Omega weapon during the finale are going to be majorly disappointed, 
   which leads me to believe that the film's opening minutes were 
   cribbed from an entirely different film. No matter, because <B><A HREF="fireback_1983b.htm">FIREBACK</A></B> 
   is still a violent, bloody film that delivers the insane goods. Be 
   sure to read about Kaplan's fate during the on-screen scrawl that 
   appears just before the final credits and try not to laugh too hard.

   (1992) -</B> Here's a war action flick from Filipino 
   director/producer Cirio H. Santiago that tries to be different. 
   During the Vietnam War, hardened chopper pilot Stewart (Martin Kove; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Miner's Massacre">MINER'S

   escort field doctor Davis (Terrence &quot;TC&quot; Carson) and his 
   assistant Li (Ronald Asinas) as they tend to wounded American 
   soldiers behind enemy lines. During one mission, which turns out to 
   be an enemy trap, Stewart endangers everyone's lives when he turns 
   his chopper around to get one more shot at the enemy. Jimmy is 
   seriously wounded by enemy fire and when they get back to base camp, 
   Davis complains to his superiors about Stewart's behavior, but they 
   do nothing about it. As a matter of fact, they brush-off Davis' 
   complaints as if they mean less than squat. On their next mission, 
   Stewart gets a cryptic mayday message on his radio by someone in a 
   plane that mentions the codeword &quot;Firehawk&quot;, some sort of 
   top secret project that shouldn't be mentioned over the airwaves. A 
   short time later, the chopper develops engine trouble and it crashes 
   in the jungle, stranding Stewart, Tex, Bates, Davis, Li and new 
   recruit Hobbs (Jeff Yonis, who also wrote the screenplay), Jimmy's 
   replacement, behind enemy lines. <A HREF="firehawk_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/firehawk vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Stewart
    checks the chopper's engine and notices that someone messed with the 
   fuel line so the engine would quit working in mid-flight. It's not 
   long before the squad begins turning on themselves, accusing each 
   other of being a saboteur and a traitor. When incriminating evidence 
   is found in Li's backpack, Stewart shoots him in the back several 
   times, even if it's plain to see to the viewers that the evidence was 
   planted. The five remaining squad members try to make it to safety, 
   but every move they make seems to be the wrong one, as if someone is 
   reporting their movements to the enemy. As members of the squad start 
   getting wounded, they start wondering why there is no rescue mission 
   (even Jimmy, back at base camp, is wondering the same thing) and 
   Davis begins questioning Stewart's map-reading skills because they 
   seem to be heading in the wrong direction. The questions remain: What 
   does all this have to do with the plane code-named 
   &quot;Firehawk&quot;? What exactly is Firehawk anyway? Who sabotaged 
   the chopper? I'm afraid you're going to have to watch the film to get 
   those answers.&nbsp; This is an above average war action/mystery 
   film, thanks to a more literate script than usual for films of this 
   type, good acting from a recognizable B-movie cast and some good 
   action set-pieces. Some reviewers have likened this film to a jungle 
   version of <B><A HREF="cube_1997.htm">CUBE</A></B> (1997), where

   - 1987), the demand for this type of film was beginning to dry-up 
   during the early part of the 90's, partly due to an over-saturated 
   home video market and partly due to cheap DTV action flicks being 
   made in Canada. This is probably Santiago's best film of the 90's. 
   There's plenty of gunfire and explosions, some gore (I liked the 
   scene of a screaming wounded soldier passing by his dismembered leg, 
   lying on the ground, as he is being carried to a waiting helicopter) 
   and some palpable tension generated in some scenes. Hey, this isn't 
   Shakespeare, but it's a good little actioner with much to recommend. 
   Santiago is a much-respected director in his native Philippines. 
   Though some of his films can be classified as tough to sit through 
   and boring, he has proven himself to be a highly-competant director 
   on many occasions. He has directed and/or produced almost 100 films 
   (so far; his last directorial effort was 2005's <B><A HREF="bloodfist_2050_2005.htm">BLOODFIST
    2050</A></B>) and I am a fan, but I am also very easy to please. 
   Most of Santiago's films must be viewed with a forgiving heart, but <B>FIREHAWK</B> 
   isn't one of those films. Also starring Henry Strzalkowski, Richard 
   Curtis, Jim Moss, Rafael Soques and a cameo by frequent Santiago 
   collaborator Joseph Zucchero, who is also this film's Editor).

   Luckily, Ron Marchini (<B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Death Machines">DEATH
    MACHINES</A></B> - 1976) doesn't have to do much emoting (he's not a 
   very good actor), but he does make a good action star. He's very 
   athletic, is good with a sword (there are a couple of lengthy sword 
   fight here) and knows his martial arts (he's a real-life Sensei with 
   a 6th degree black belt). He also produced this using his full name, 
   Ronald Lee Marchini, as he does with most of the films he starred in. 
   While nothing special, this film (which clocks in at a scant 76 
   minutes) is never boring or lacks for action. Hardly a minute goes by 
   without someone getting killed in one way or another (there's a nasty 
   spiked boobytrap-to-the-groin gag late in the film) and there's some 
   good use of slow-motion photography during some of the action scenes.

   Here's a good reason why I love the Philippines. When the mysterious 
   Mr. Giant (who only communicates through lighted circular mirrors) 
   has his men kidnap American scientist Dr. Von Kohler (Mike Monty) so 
   he can supply the formula for the dreaded &quot;N Bomb&quot; 
   (&quot;This bomb could end the world!&quot;), the Philippines 
   government send their &quot;main man&quot;, Agent 00 (the 33 inch 
   tall Weng Weng) to rescue him. His Chief (Tony Ferrer) supplies him 
   with a bunch of gadgets, including a ring that can detect any type of 
   poison (&quot;It's made out of gold. Platinum was too 
   expensive.&quot;), a specially-made sub-machine gun (with silencer) 
   and a hat with a hidden blade, and then sends Agent 00 on his way. He 
   meets a prostitute in a restaurant (&quot;I like them little!&quot;), 
   who tries to poison his glass of Coke, but his ring starts to beep, 
   so he drinks Coke straight out of the bottle! He gets in contact with 
   undercover agent Irma (Beth Sandoval), who is working at one of Mr. 
   Giant's drug factories, where drugs are inserted into loaves of bread 
   (One of the head goons says, &quot;There's a lot of dough in this 
   dough. The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker!&quot; What???). 
   Agent 00 (who is sometimes called simply &quot;Wang&quot;) breaks up 
   the operation with his expert martial arts moves, which pisses off 
   Mr. Giant. He demands that his men steal some gold (&quot;N Bombs 
   today are expensive!&quot;) and Irma overhears the <A HREF="for_yur_height_only_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/for your height only dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>conversation.
    She reports it to Agent 00 and gets worried when he says that he'll 
   take care of it himself (She says, &quot;You're such a little guy, 
   though. Very petite, like a potato!&quot;). Agent 00 quickly 
   breaks-up the gold robbery with a button grenade (shades of Matt 
   Helm) and his Oddjob-like hat. Mr. Giant sends his goons to kill 
   Agent 00 (one assassin has an umbrella gun), but he manages to defeat 
   them all, usually with swift kicks or punches to their tackleboxes 
   and caps it off by jumping off a highrise balcony using the 
   assassin's umbrella as a parachute! He goes back to his hotel room, 
   where three hitmen are waiting for him. Agent 00 puts on a pair of 
   x-ray glasses that can see through walls and clothing (the hitmen are 
   shown naked!) and shoots all three of them dead. Believe it or not, 
   this is only the first thirty minutes of the film, as Agent 00 must 
   battle a multitude of bad guys; in discos, warehouses, on the street 
   and even on a bridge with a rapidly approaching train, before he has 
   a showdown with Mr. Giant on his private island (where Agent 00 dons 
   a jet pack and takes flight!) and tries to save the life of a captive 
   Irma. If you don't like where this is heading, you can do like one of 
   the bad guys says and &quot;Button-up your hole!&quot;&nbsp; This 
   corny, irresistable Filipino action flick, the second to star the 
   diminutive Weng Weng as Agent 00 (the first being the 
   yet-to-be-released outside the Philippines <B><A HREF="agent_00_1981.htm">AGENT
    00</A></B> [1981]), is so funny, thanks to the hilarious dubbing 
   that makes all the goons (and Agent 00) sound like they were in a 
   30's Edward G. Robinson or James Cagney gangster film, that you'll 
   ignore this film's many (pardon the pun) shortcomings. Besides having 
   some of the most off-the-wall dialogue I have ever heard (I 
   especially liked when one burly goon replies, &quot;That's Boy Scout 
   doo-doo!&quot; when Irma tells him that she's loyal to Agent 00) and 
   some action sequences that can best be describes as surreal (I 
   thought I was going to shit a brick after watching Agent 00 jump on 
   one bad guy's stomach and then proceed to smack him silly with his 
   hands, clapping and smacking, clapping and smacking in some 
   otherworldly hand-jive ritual), director Eddie Nicart (also 
   responsible for the first Agent 00 adventure and the third, and 
   final, film,&nbsp; <B><A HREF="#ImpossibleKid">THE IMPOSSIBLE KID</A></B> 
   [1982]) fills the film with numerous James Bond references, even 
   stealing riffs from the Bond music theme and from the title tune to <B><A HREF="for_your_eyes_only_1981.htm">FOR
    YOUR EYES ONLY</A></B> (1981)! Watching the tiny Weng Weng (who died 
   at age 34 in 1992) running around punching and kicking bad guys in 
   the crotch, being irresistable to women and spouting line like, 
   &quot;Ow, my little head!&quot; and &quot;Once you go tiny, you never 
   go back!&quot; is a hoot and I dare anyone not to fall for his 
   charms. It's also apparent that the Australian dubbing team was 
   having a lot of fun here. Besides the totally out-of-place 30's 
   Brooklyn accents and phrases (hearing them with an Australian accent 
   is worth the price of admission in itself), they also inserted a ton 
   of &quot;short people&quot; jokes (One gangster says, when watching 
   Irma coming out of Agent 00's room alone, &quot;Where the hell's that 
   little midget?&quot; His partner replies, &quot;Probably hiding in 
   her handbag!&quot;) and funny asides, such as when someone in a crowd 
   says, &quot;I wonder if she also does weddings and bar mitzvas?&quot; 
   when a female police photographer takes pictures of a dead body. The 
   final battle between Agent 00 and Mr. Giant who, if you haven't 
   already guessed, is also a midget (he still towers over Weng Weng, 
   though), is the stuff of legend. I also found it strange that while 
   played as a comedy, there was a bittersweet ending at the finale</FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">.</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">

   If this film feels disjointed and confusing, it could be because one 
   of the main stars died during mid-production, leaving the filmmakers 
   with one of two choices: 1) Re-film all the scenes of the deceased 
   actor with a new actor, or, 2) Add plenty of voiceover narration, 
   create a multitude of confusing flashbacks and re-edit the existing 
   footage to make it look like the deceased actor made it through the 
   entire shoot. Guess which choice they made? After we learn that three 
   Cuban terrorists have made their way to New Orleans, we follow the 
   exploits of two of Louisiana's Finest, police detectives Andre Des 
   Moines (Michael Parks; <B><A HREF="planet_terror_2007.htm">PLANET TERROR</A></B> 
   - 2007) and R.J. Wilkerson (the late Bill Holliday, who also wrote 
   the screenplay and suffered a fatal heart attack in mid-production), 
   who are good at their jobs but disregard the rule constantly, which 
   gets them in trouble with the Review Board, who want to split them 
   apart after seventeen years of being partners. Instead of breaking 
   them apart, they are used to the force's best ad<A HREF="french_quarter_undercover_1985b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/french quarter undercover vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>vantage
    and put on special assignment to stop the three Cuban terrorists and 
   their Russian KGB boss, who they believe are in New Orleans to blow 
   up the World's Fair (remember them?). So far, so good, right? Well, 
   at this point the film becomes a murky mess, as a series of 
   documentary-like interviews with FBI agent David T. Anderson (Lee 
   Holmes) and freelance journalist Kevin Fisher (Layton Martens) fill 
   us in on what happened with Andre and R.J.'s investigation. It 
   suddenly shifts from a first-person to a third-person narrative, 
   where the two detectives hunt for the terrorists becomes a series of 
   jumpy and badly edited flashbacks, It's not only confusing as hell, 
   as the story shifts from Andre and R.J. seemingly shooting people for 
   no good reason, to them investigating a rash of phony $100 bills 
   flooding New Orleans, to them then investigating the murder of a 
   hooker named Princess (Suzanne Regard), it also turns into a 
   travelogue of 1984 New Orleans, where a huge chunk of the running 
   time is watching badly dressed tourists gawking at the attractions at 
   the World's Fair and Bourbon Street. When Andre and R.J. kill one of 
   the terrorists, they find a biological agent that could have been 
   used to contaminate the drinking water at the World's Fair, which 
   only adds to this film's wobbly nature. After harassing a pimp and 
   killing the second terrorist, Andre and R.J. must stop the third 
   terrorist, who has commandeered a tram at the World's Fair and is 
   threatening to drop the biological agent (which he keeps in a common 
   thermos!) into the water below. What do our two detectives do? Why, 
   they simply shoot the top of the tram until the cable snaps and the 
   tram falls into the water! Luckily, the thermos doesn't break and New 
   Orleans is saved. Or is it? An on-screen scrawl at the end of the 
   film tells us that Andre and R.J. quit the police force to open their 
   own P.I. agency to do consulting work for the government. Puh-lease! 
   If all you are looking for is a colorful time capsule of 1984 New 
   Orleans, <B><A HREF="french_quarter_undercover_1985b.htm">FRENCH 
   QUARTER UNDERCOVER</A></B> is the film for you, as it gives you 
   numerous scenes of the World's Fair and the bars and jazz clubs at 
   night on Bourbon Street. But if it's a cohesive action film you are 
   looking for, look somewhere else, because it makes about as much 
   sense as a retard at a Mensa meeting. Co-directors Patrick C. Poole (<B><A HREF="shadows_on_the_wall_1986.htm">SHADOWS
    ON THE WALL</A></B> - 1986) and Joe Catalanotto (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Terror Swamp">TERROR
    IN THE SWAMP</A></B> - 1984; also starring Holliday) try to make the 
   best of a bad situation (it seems Catalanotto shot the film proper 
   and Poole took over when Bill Holliday died and filmed the interview 
   sequences as a way to bridge the material already in the can), but 
   it's hard to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, especially when 
   the film proper was terrible to begin with. Old pro Michael Parks is 
   given very little to do besides run around and fire his gun and 
   Holliday's screenplay is full of groan-inducing dialogue, such as 
   when R.J. says, &quot;That's right Sambo, you ain't nothing but a 
   two-bit douchebag&quot; to a black pimp and then threatens him and 
   his pimpmobile with a slingshot! There's very little to recommend 
   here, but if you're a fan of murky nighttime photography, chainsaw 
   editing and badly-staged action sequences (including an awful car 
   chase and a terribly-filmed shootout/massacre at a restaurant), then 
   by all means revel at the awesomeness that is <B><A HREF="french_quarter_undercover_1985c.htm">FRENCH

   produce seller by day and a pimp with a stable of whores at night. 
   One morning, while on his daily swim in the pool at his health spa, 
   he finds the body of a young woman floating in the water. The doctor 
   that examines her body tells Toto that she was murdered in salt water 
   (most probably the ocean because he finds a piece of seaweed in her 
   mouth) and dumped in the pool. There are clear bruises on her neck 
   showing that she was purposely drowned. Is someone sending a message 
   to Toto? It seems so, because he knew the young woman. She was one of 
   his whores and her name was Francesca. Toto phones his associate Lino 
   Caruso (Antonio Casagrande; <B><A HREF="why_1971.htm">WHY</A></B> - 
   1971) to tell him the news and saying to send the &quot;boys&quot; to 
   his office. He tells his &quot;boys&quot; that Francesca was his 
   top-earning whore and whomever killed her is going to pay for it with 
   their life, but first they must find out who murdered her. Chief 
   Inspector Contalvi (Franco Fantasia; Lenzi's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EatenAlive1980">EATEN

   named Roger Daverty (Philippe Leroy; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#MilanoCalibro9">MILANO
    CALIBRO 9</A></B> - 1972) approaches Toto and offers him a deal to 
   distribute heroin in his territory.&nbsp; He wants to use Toto's 
   whores to distribute his &quot;snow&quot;, Toto to get 20% and he to 
   get 80% of the proceeds. Toto tells Daverty, who likes to be called 
   &quot;Captain&quot; (so that is what I will call him), that if he 
   leaves his house now, he will forget he ever heard of this lousy 
   deal. Captain then tells him it was he who killed Francesca and he 
   will give him three days to agree to the deal. And, oh, if he doesn't 
   agree to the deal, he hid a large quantity of heroin in Toto's house, 
   but don't bother to look for it because he will never find it. One 
   phone call to the police will put Toto in prison for a long time. 
   Toto doesn't take kindly to threats, so he and Lino go to Captain's 
   home and find a giant salt water terrarium, full of squid and octopus 
   (octopi?), probably where he killed Francesca. Toto then has his boys 
   tear his house apart looking for the hidden heroin and they find it 
   hidden in a box of cereal. The Chief Inspector tells Toto he knows 
   who he is and what he does and he will personally put him out of 
   business. It looks like he is a man of his word, as we see the police 
   round up all of Toto's whores, only they are not the police, they are 
   Captain's boys dressed as police. Captain phones Toto and tells him 
   is he wants to ever see his whores alive, he will agree to the deal 
   and do business with him. Toto agrees, but he's a shrewd businessman, 
   asking for 50% of the profits rather than 20% and Captain agrees to 
   30%. They now have a deal in place, but will Toto be a man of his

   Captain nearly dies when his car explodes, he retaliates by sending 
   his men to rape and beat up Toto's whores (one of them is graphically 
   sliced on her breasts with a switchblade). While Toto breaks in 
   Virginia with an Italian dignitary, he goes to Jasmina's house, where 
   he is jumped by some of Captain's men. Toto holds his own, but he is 
   saved from certain death when the police show up. Lino then tells

   (Tano Cimarosa; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Delirium1972">DELIRIUM</A></B>

   going to work on her own. Toto confronts Virginia and she tells him 
   it simply isn't true, Nino works for Captain, so Toto invites Nino to 
   have dinner with him at a restaurant, where he has some of his boys 
   kill Nino in the bathroom (giving him a hotshot of heroin), while

   America, to get him to come to Milan and take Toto's side, which he 
   does. Don Barone (who has a huge scar under his left eye) introduces 
   himself to Captain, making him feel very uneasy. Then, many of 
   Captain's men are roughed-up or killed. Barone's men kill one of 
   Captain's top men, Taki (Riccardo De Stefanis) and his wife in a 
   drive-by shooting as they are transporting a huge shipment of heroin 
   across the border, the wife hiding the heroin in her fake boobs! Taki 
   doesn't die, so Barone's men go to the hospital and kill him by 
   blowing air into his IV! The police raid Captain's gambling den, but 
   he skates on the charges. Don Barone tells Toto that he and Captain 
   are like America and Russia, fighting each other but accomplishing 
   nothing (wise man). Captain then kidnaps Lino and tells him he could 
   be the boss if Toto were dead. Lino tells him to drop dead, so 
   Captain calls Toto and has him listen to his thugs torturing Lino, 
   sending electrical shocks to his genitals. Captain then sends his men 
   to Virginia's house to leave a message: Lino's bloody necktie. Toto 
   thinks that means Lino is dead, but he's not. Lino escapes from

   all!), agrees to cut Toto and Lino in for 50% of the drug racket 
   profits and they begin to do business together. Toto falls in love 
   with Jasmina, where he tells her a heart-warming story about how he 
   and Lino became friends. Don Barone, however, becomes greedy, 
   demanding 20% of the take from Toto, since it was he who changed 
   things for the better for him. But are they really? We discover that 
   these &quot;good times&quot; are anything but for Toto, as an 
   important dignitary dies with one of his whores and the friendship 
   between him and Lino becomes very strained. Don Barone brings more of 
   his men to Milan and he double-crosses both Toto and Captain, leading 
   to a very depressing, nihilistic finale. When you ask for help from

   and staid Antonio Sabato, who impressed me here. He doesn't take shit 
   from anyone, which eventually leads to his downfall. Director Umberto 
   Lenzi ladles-on one tense situation to the next, as we wait for the 
   screen to explode with violence. It's not all the back-and-forth 
   between him and Captain that leads to his downfall, but rather when 
   Jasmina leaves him without saying a word that does him in.&nbsp; You 
   would think that a man with a stable of whores would know how to 
   handle rejection, but, quite frankly, he loses his mind, taking the 
   Chief Inspector hostage when he comes to his house and finds a large 
   quantity of heroin, placed there, once again, by Captain. Toto drives 
   to Virginia's house and tells her to go back to her baby and then 
   visits his sick mother in the hospital, only to be betrayed by Lino 
   and Don Barone, who kill Captain and then gun down Toto. He should 
   have kept his friends closer than his enemies. The screenplay, by

   DVD case. It listed absolutely no credits whatsoever but, in tiny 
   type at the bottom, it listed a copyright date of 1970 by Crown 
   International Pictures. Thinking that I found some obscure horror 
   film that I never heard of, I bought it on the spot.&nbsp; Boy, was I 
   bamboozled! This is actually a lame 1996 actioner starring Antonio 
   Fargas as Santos, a diamond smuggler who imports his diamonds from 
   China in the bellies of Chinese alligators to his compound in 
   Florida.&nbsp; When environmental journalist Maureen (Shannon K. 
   Foley) discovers Santos' smuggling scheme, she enlists help from 
   ex-lover Ronnie (Jay Richardson), a sheriff's ranger, to put an end 
   to Santos' slaughter of the endangered gators and illicit ice 
   trafficing. This proves difficult as Santos has paid off the sheriff 
   (a boozed-up Joe Estevez) and the local government to look the other 
   way. This extremely talky actioner offers nothing of interest to the 
   viewer. Antonio Fargas overacts shamelessly, seemingly basing his

    Victor ends up in prison where he is abused by the prison guards. He 
   is released and goes out on a spree, nearly killing all the prison 
   guards that abused him (one of them being Aldo Ray) dressed in full 
   riot gear and equipped with a &quot;Riot Glove&quot;, a five pound 
   device that can literally tear a car apart. Debt-ridden bounty hunter

   alimony, takes on nickel and dime skip tracing jobs to make ends meet 
   (We first see him bust gay phony check-writer Nicholas Worth for a

   during the last duel between Sam and Victor (where Victor gives Sam

   (1987) -</B> When Greg (stunt coordinator Jeff Moldovan; <B><A HREF="#Masterblaster">MASTERBLASTER</A></B> 
   - 1986) sets foot in Miami, the first thing he does is contact his 
   good cop buddy Hammer (Daniel Greene) and tells him he has gotten 
   into trouble with some &quot;heavy hitters&quot; back in Jamaica. He 
   gives Hammer a key and, before he can tell him what it's for, a 
   blonde hitman (Frank Zagarino, who never says a word his entire time 
   on screen) drops a shipping container on Greg's car, killing him. 
   This leads to a car/motorcycle chase that ends up at a busy train 
   station where a shootout occurs and several innocent people are shot 
   dead. The hitman gets away and Hammer is forced by his Chief to take 
   a 15 day vacation, so he decides to go to Jamaica to find out what 
   Greg was involved in. His good friend, taxi driver Jose (Jorge Gil), 
   meets Hammer at the Jamaican airport and drives him and fellow plane 
   passenger (and writer) Julia (Donna Rosae) to a hotel. Hammer has to 
   tell Greg's girlfriend D.D. (Deanna Lund) that Greg is dead and she 
   tells him that there's a new bigshot on the island, but no one knows 
   who he is. When Hammer goes to check out Greg's apartment, he notices 
   a couple of burly guys with guns staking it out. He sneaks into the 
   apartment to find it ransacked and when he leaves, Hammer spots the 
   blonde hitman and gives chase, but he gets away again. After being 
   warned by the Dutch head of the Jamaican Police, Commissioner 
   Hendricks (Tony Hendriks), to keep his nose clean, Hammer gets a tip 
   that an Italian businessman by the name of Giuseppe Vari (Lawrence 
   McQuillan) may be responsible for Greg's death. When D.D. gets <A HREF="hammerhead_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hammerhead 1987 dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>beaten
    to a bloody pulp by one of Vari's men, Hammer and Jose (who served 
   in the same army outfit in Vietnam, along with Greg and a fourth 
   member named Carlos, who is now missing), go to Vari's mansion and 
   spot the blonde hitman riding a jet ski in the bay. Hammer grabs 
   another jet ski and gives chase, which climaxes in hand-to-hand 
   combat at a boatyard. Hammer kills blondie with a speargun (&quot;Die 
   you motherfucker!&quot;) and is promptly arrested. Jose tricks 
   Commissioner Hendricks into releasing Hammer (Hendricks may be on 
   Vari's payroll) and D.D. tries to get Hammer's mind off his troubles 
   for a little while by setting him up with his old girlfriend Marta 
   (Melonee Rodgers), who tells Hammer that Greg kept a notebook, 
   written in code, that explained everything. Hammer and Jose discover 
   that their missing friend Carlos may be involved with Vari and Jose 
   is then betrayed, shot and tortured by someone he trusted. When 
   Vari's men kill D.D., Hammer finds a tape that Greg made that says 
   the key he gave Hammer is to a locker that contains a fortune in 
   stolen money. Marta and her young daughter (who is, surprise!, also 
   Hammer's daughter) are kidnapped, so Hammer and Jose (who escapes his 
   captors after a nifty body explosion) have a showdown with the bad 
   guys at a sugar factory. Expects lots of stunts, gunfights, 
   fistfights and death by circular saw to follow.&nbsp; This is a 
   breezy Italian actioner that benefits greatly from the beautiful 
   Jamaican location photography. Director/screenwriter Enzo G.

   in numerous chases, fistfights and other violent imagery (Deanna 
   Lund's beatdown is especially disturbing) to keep your mind off how 
   ridiculous the script really is. Using local actors alongside the 
   Italian talent also gives this film an edge. Daniel Greene, who 
   previously appeared in <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Deadly Intruder">THE

    OF THE TIGER</A></B> - 1986) make a good team and the film is not 
   without it's share of humor or surprises. There are jokes about the 
   Dutch (And, really, when was the last time you heard a funny Dutch 
   joke?), a tasteless &quot;giving head&quot; bit and a surprising 
   revelation about one of the characters in the finale. There are also 
   plenty of bloody bullet squibs, some good use of slow-motion 
   photography in the action scenes and lots of stunts. <B><A HREF="hammerhead_1987b.htm">HAMMERHEAD</A></B> 
   (the on-screen title is simply <B><A HREF="hammer_1987.htm">HAMMER</A></B>,

   although the new name does share the same title with <A HREF="hammerhead_1968.htm">a

   mindless, bloody fun. The finale at the sugar factory seems to cram 
   in as much violence as humanly possible, as Hammer has his face 
   ripped open by the spinning blade of a circular saw (he ends up 
   throwing his attacker chest-first into the spinning blade), the 
   corrupt Commissioner Hendricks is shot in the balls, there's an 
   awesome car crash, another major character is burned to death, 
   another is buried under a ton of raw sugar and still another is shot 
   between the eyes. Toss in a pretty decent surprise ending and what 
   you have is an enjoyable way to spend 92 minutes of your life. Also 
   starring Nandy Lee, Anthony Carone, Peter Gold and Mike Kirton. I 
   don't believe this ever got a legitimate U.S. home video release. The 
   print I viewed came from a Dutch-subtitled VHS tape. <B>Not Rated</B>,

   that his uncle is involved). Unfortunately, Karl won't have the

   also tries to kill Ally, but she is saved by Tonio (Romulo Arantes), 
   an old friend of Amanda's who informs Ally of her mother's 
   Nazi-hunting background. El Pasado manages to steal three of Amanda's 
   notebooks, but she hid the fourth and final one (the one that 
   contains the location of Dr. Hoffmann's jungle hideout) and only Ally 
   knows where it is. Ally and Tonio form an uneasy partnership to

   and cultural differences long enough to stop Dr. Hoffmann before he 
   carries out his wicked experiment? They hire crazy mercenary Kong 
   (Russ McCubbin) to lead them down river and assault Dr. Hoffmann's 
   jungle compound in the film's badly-staged finale.&nbsp; This is a 
   plodding and long-winded jungle action flick, marred by the 
   non-chemistry between Romulo Arantes and Candice Daly, who have to 
   carry the second half of the film and, quite frankly, don't have the 
   chops to pull it off. Director/producer Ernst R. von Theumer (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BigBustOut">THE
    BIG BUST-OUT</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="action.htm#JungleWarriors">JUNGLE
    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1984), working with a script by James Dalessandro 
   and Louis La Russo II, tosses in a little bit of everything, from 
   jungle adventure, chases (and a plane crash), espionage and even a 
   touch of WIP in hopes something will stick. Very little of it does, 
   as von Theumer films it all in a very laid-back and lackadaisical 
   manner, offering no urgency in the action scenes and saddling the 
   actors with such cringe-inducing dialogue like, &quot;I haven't heard 
   a good idea since my husband's suicide!&quot; There is occasional 
   nudity, some good on-location photography and a few nifty explosions, 
   but there are too many dead spots in the film where everything just 
   screeches to a halt so Ally and Tonio can get to know each other 
   better (in other words, have sex). Another problem is Dr. Hoffmann's 
   serum. For a film whose main plot devise is Dr. Hoffmann's mind 
   control serum, not once to we see it utilized. That's a shame, 
   because this film could have used that exploitative element to 
   jazz-up an otherwise uneventful film. Both Stewart Granger and George 
   Lazenby are woefully underutilized here and look embarrassed. 
   (Lazenby is misidentified on the VHS cover art, a head shot of actor 
   Herb Andrews, who plays Johann in this film, is mislabeled as being 
   that of Lazenby). Candice Daly was a tragic figure. After appearing 
   in a handful of films, she was found dead of a drug overdose in a 
   skid row motel room in 2004. She was 41 years old. Co-star Romulo 
   Arantes, a champion swimmer, died in a plane crash while flying over 
   Brazil in 2000. He was killed two days before his 43rd birthday. As a 
   matter of fact, besides Maud Adams and Lazenby, all the other main 
   actors here have died, all of them from cancer. That's just spooky.

   (1978), has never made or appeared in a good film (Really! Try 
   watching any of them and judge for yourself). Both Adam West and Tina 
   Louise were paid $10,000 each for one day's shooting and director 
   Bryan filmed most of their scenes in extreme close-up (usually 
   wearing hats or scarves), so he could heve their scenes inserted at 
   various times throughout the film. It's highly apparent that body 
   doubles were used the rest of the time, as they are always filmed 
   from behind or with their faces hidden from view (although the Adam 
   West double does get some face time in the finale). The entire Hell 
   Riders motorcycle gang is one of the weakest and most ineffective 
   gangs you will ever see, as they are manhandled and abused by 
   everyone they meet. Even their final assault on Ramsburg is ho-hum, 
   as all they do is rip a couple of women's shirts, beat up the sheriff 
   and lock everyone in jail. I get more excitement watching goldfish 
   swim in a bowl. This should cement your opinion that James Bryan and 
   Renee Harmon were two of the worst individuals to work behind (and in 
   front of ) a camera. One of my favorite scenes comes early on, where 
   Father (Frank Newhouse), the &quot;religious&quot; member of the Hell 
   Riders, explains to Claire how his right hand was cut off. It's plain 
   to see by looking at his bandaged stump that his hand is still 
   underneath the bandages. It's sloppiness like this (including two of 
   the worst car crashes ever committed to celluloid) which should put 
   this film on your &quot;must avoid&quot; list. Also starring Ricco 
   Mancini, Dan Bradley, Lynn Wiedermayer, Arline Specht and Sandra

    -</B> Wonderfully weird action film made in the Philippines. As the 
   film opens in 1980, a Miami doctor is seen inserting a metal object 
   into an unknown patient's arm. The doctor then tells the patient that 
   he's all &quot;wired up&quot; and can go home and relax. A short time 
   later, the patient shoots the doctor between the eyes as he is 
   walking out of his office. A &quot;few years later&quot;, a group of 
   gunmen, led by Charles Barner (&quot;Robert Mason&quot; a.k.a. Robert 
   Marius; <B><A HREF="#WarWithoutEnd">WAR WITHOUT END</A></B> - 1986), 
   invade the home of Professor Arlington (Mike Monty in a Speedo!) and 
   shoot-up his pool party, killing all the professor's hired bodyguards 
   except for McPearson (Bruce Baron; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#UltimateNinja">THE
    ULTIMATE NINJA</A></B> - 1986) and kidnapping the Professor and his 
   beautiful assistant Liza (Liza Hutton). The police believe McPearson 
   was in on the kidnapping, but his boss, Cunningham (James Moss; <B><A HREF="#Silk2">SILK
    2</A></B> - 1989), the head of Cunningham Security, doesn't believe 
   it for a minute. Barner brings the Professor and Liza to the 
   well-guarded mansion of Escaler (&quot;Eric Harris&quot; a.k.a. Eric 
   Hahn) and after being paid with a briefcase full of money, Escaler 
   tries to reneg on the deal and orders his red beret-wearing soldiers 
   to kill Barner, but Barner escapes after being grazed in the head 
   with a bullet. McPearson is able to identify Barner from a mug shot 
   and finds out from Cunningham that Barner was an old<A HREF="heroes_for_hire_1987b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/heroes for hire dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Vietnam buddy of his. McPearson begins his search for Barner, not 
   aware that Escaler is now gunning for them both. McPearson learns 
   from Curly (Jim Gaines; <B><A HREF="action.htm#JungleRats">JUNGLE RATS</A></B> 
   - 1987), an old friend of Barner's, that Barner was offered a job 
   from an &quot;old boss&quot;, but before Curly is able to offer any 
   more information, he is gunned-down in a crowded restaurant. Escaler 
   sends a ransom tape to the Professor's wife (Barbara Parks), 
   demanding ten million dollars for her husband's safe return. It is at 
   this time that we learn that Liza is actually Escaler's girlfriend 
   and was in on the kidnapping. Escaler and Liza are after some 
   microfilm in the Professor's possession and are trying to trick the 
   Professor into giving up the microfilm's location, but the Professor 
   plays dumb and refuses to acknowledge the existence of the microfilm. 
   Mrs. Arlington hires McPearson to find her husband and he gets a 
   break when Barner calls him up and demands one million dollars for 
   the Professor's location. McPearson and Barner meet face-to-face to 
   make the exchange, only to have Barner shot in the back before he can 
   turn over the map to the Professor's location. It turns out that 
   Barner tattooed the map on his girlfriend's ass (!) and when 
   McPearson goes to retrieve it, Escaler's men kill her, too. When 
   Escaler kidnaps Mrs. Arlington to get the Professor to talk, 
   Cunningham employs a trio of &quot;Heroes For Hire&quot;, Magnum 
   (&quot;Jerry Bayron&quot; a.k.a. Jerry Bailey), Cactus (&quot;Don 
   Parker&quot; a.k.a. Don Holtz) and Ninja (Anthony Chang) to accompany 
   McPearson in rescuing the Professor and his wife. Remember the unseen 
   patient in the beginning of the film? He plays an important role in 
   the film's triple-twist ending, where good guys are traitors, women 
   are not who they seem and nearly everyone dies at the hands of the 
   people they betrayed. Good times. Good times.&nbsp; What I liked 
   about this film, directed by John Lloyd (<B><A HREF="#NinjaWarriors">NINJA
    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1984; <B><A HREF="#NinjasForce2">NINJA'S FORCE II</A></B> 
   - 1986; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#KingKickboxers2">KING OF THE 
   KICKBOXERS 2</A></B> - 1992) and written by Timothy Jorge (for 
   Producer K.Y. Lim and his Silver Star Film Company), is that it 
   always zigs when you think it is going to zag. I always thought the 
   film would conclude with McPearson and Barner reluctantly 
   partnering-up to rescue the Professor (for totally different reasons, 
   of course), so imagine my surprise when Barner is non-chalantly 
   killed on their first meeting after the Professor's kidnapping. The 
   inclusion of the three Heroes For Hire in the final reel of the film 
   also comes out of left field, as we are given a brief vignette of 
   each Hero, in flashback, performing a heroic deed and then 
   immediately throwing them into the fray. They all join McPearson by 
   choosing a different method of transportation to get to Escaler's 
   island compound (scuba gear; rubber raft; jet ski; windsurfing) and 
   then attack on all four sides, using explosive balloons (!), a 
   machinegun/bazooka equipped motorcycle, ninja weapons and acrobatics, 
   and good old-fashioned firepower to try to save the Professor and his 
   wife. Since this film defies all normal expectations, it should come 
   as no surprise that the Professor is shot dead before his wife's eyes 
   long before McPearson or the three Heroes can save him and we then 
   learn that wifey has an agenda all her own. The violence in this film 
   is brutal and bloody, as people are blown apart, sliced, stabbed or 
   riddled with bullets and Ninja's ability to split into five exact 
   copies of himself will have you rewinding the scene several times in 
   disbelief. <B><A HREF="heroes_for_hire_1987c.htm">HEROES FOR HIRE</A></B>

    CROSSING</A><A NAME="HuntersCrossing"></A> (1983) -</B> Here's one 
   of late director Teddy Page's earliest Filipino actioners, filmed 
   back-to-back with <B><A HREF="#Fireback1983">FIREBACK</A></B> and <B><A HREF="#Blood Debts">BLOOD
    DEBTS</A></B> (both 1983) and utilizing many of the same actors and 
   technical crew. The film opens with a squad of American soldiers 
   rescuing millionaire Mr. Burns (Pat Andrew), his daughter Lois 
   (Barbara Peers) and several other women from a Vietnam slave camp. 
   The soldiers battle it out with some gooks (you can tell they are 
   gooks by the cone-shaped straw hats they wear) while Mr. Burns and 
   the women hop on a junket and head for the safety of the sea. Their 
   freedom is short-lived, however, when their boat is boarded by pirate 
   leader Jamil (David Light) and his crew and Mr. Burns and the women 
   are taken to Jamil's base camp deep in the jungle. After a short 
   skirmish with some jungle rebels, Jamil and his hostages make it to 
   the camp, which is heavily guarded. Jamil sends Burn's son, James 
   Burns Jr. (Richard Harrison), a ransom demand of 4.5 million dollars 
   for the safe return of his father and sister, so James hedges his 
   bets by having his right-hand man Harris (Philip Gamboa) hire some of 
   the best mercenaries he can find to assist him in the rescue of his 
   family (and they will split a cool 1.5 million dollars if 
   successful). Harris picks out bar brawler Max (Don Gordon), 
   pussy-whipped Tom (James Gaines) and <A HREF="hunters_crossing_1983c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hunter's crossing variety ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>womanizer
    Al (Bruce Baron) for the rescue mission, but first they have to be 
   rigorously trained (Cue the 80's-style training montage). When Jamil 
   forces Mr. Burns to write a letter demanding the delivery of the 
   ransom within 72 hours (Jamil says, &quot;You'll write the letter or 
   I'll have your daughter!&quot;), Harris must immediately put his 
   rescue plan into action, which includes customizing a black sedan and 
   a three-wheeled chopper with machine guns, bulletproof shields and 
   rocket launchers. Al puts the mission in jeopardy by taking a side 
   job as acting as a wheel man in a bank robbery and then ripping-off 
   all the loot, which really angers the crime boss who hired him for 
   the job. The crime boss puts a price on Al's head, which leads to a 
   shoot-out and a car chase, where Al uses the black sedan's rocket 
   launchers to blow-up the car chasing him. After another attempt on 
   Al's life and Tom finding his wife Sherri (Ann Milhench) in bed with 
   another man (who Tom shoots three times point-blank!), the rescue 
   plan is put into action. As more secrets are revealed (Harris is 
   married to Lois!), the ragtag group raid Jamil's camp (Jamil had 
   raped Lois the night before) and Harris grabs Lois, while Al grabs 
   Mr. Burns. Tom gives up his life when he throws himself on a grenade 
   (and is blown to bits) and Al is shot to death protecting the other 
   women hostages (who also don't fare too well). Just when it looks 
   like everyone else is going to make it out alive, Jamil kills Harris 
   and Lois pumps a clip into Jamil. What about Jack Jr., you may ask? 
   Well, it turns out he never left his office, so he was never in any 
   danger (unless he stubs his toe on his desk). Oh, those crazy 
   Filipinos. You gotta love them!&nbsp; Like most of Teddy Page's films (<B><A HREF="#Ninja'sForce">NINJA'S

   - 1987), there are scenes of brutal violence, nudity and action set 
   pieces mixed with a few &quot;What the fuck?!?&quot; sequences that 
   throws the viewer for a loop. The screenplay, by Timothy Jorge (<B>FIREBACK</B>),
    switches gears so often, it's really hard for the audience to know 
   who to root for. For one, we are supposed to feel sorry for Tom, 
   because he is so much in love with his wife, only to discover that 
   she's been cheating on him for years with numerous men. But instead 
   of walking away from Sherri by giving her a curt &quot;Fuck 
   you!&quot;, he murders his wife's latest lover in such a way that it 
   is hard to have sympathy for Tom. And then there's Al. All he cares 
   about is himself and he puts his team members in dangerous situations 
   several times. Harris, on the other hand, seems to be the only decent 
   man in the bunch, but when it is revealed that he is married to Lois, 
   it is also made clear that Mr. Burns never cared for Harris and 
   disapproves of the marriage, which is why he makes Lois follow him 
   around on all his business trips like some puppy dog. Richard 
   Harrison's role as Jack is so underwritten (he spends most of his 
   screen time talking on the phone and only interacts on-screen with 
   Philip Gamboa), that it is nothing but a glorified cameo, even if he 
   does get top billing. Max is the only character deserving of any 
   sympathy (he's a divorced dad that has a young son that loves him), 
   but his death is so matter-of-fact, it's the most forgettable of the 
   bunch. You can see that Page was still getting his action chops here, 
   as some of the action set pieces are awkwardly filmed (especially the 
   car chase) and he made a choice to keep some of the violence 
   off-screen (Tom shooting his wife's lover; Lois shooting Jamil), but 
   there's enough bloody violence, gunfire and explosions, not to 
   mention some weird turns of events, to keep fans of Filipino 
   actioners happy. Also starring Ann Jackson, Tim Bismark, Biggie 
   Mielke, Willy Williams and Arturo Estrada. Also known as <B><A HREF="deadly_hunters_1983.htm">DEADLY

    island of Correbalas, only to discover that the Japs were expecting 
   them. After watching all his comrades being viciously slaughtered (by 
   gunshot, bayonette or, in one extreme case, beheaded [it goes by so 
   quickly, you'll need to replay the scene frame-by-frame to get the 
   full effect]), Paco barely escapes with his life. A stubborn American 
   general (an extended cameo by Ken Metcalfe; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomanHunt1972">THE
    WOMAN HUNT</A></B> - 1972) wants to capture that stronghold at any 
   cost (he even threatens to send his second-in-command to the island 
   if he doesn't come up with a viable solution quickly), so Colonel 
   Blake (Joseph Zucchero; <B><A HREF="#Silk1986">SILK</A></B> - 1986) 
   orders Major &quot;Stony&quot; Stonewell (John Ericson; <B><A HREF="#FinalMission1984">FINAL
    MISSION</A></B> - 1984) to find a way to sneak onto the island and 
   kill some important Japanese generals and admirals that will be 
   visiting the stronghold soon. At first, Stony and Paco are stymied on 
   how to infiltrate the island, but when an Australian woman beats the 
   crap out of both of them in a bar fight, they come up with the 
   brilliant idea to use &quot;broads&quot; to pretend to be prostitutes 
   and make their way to the island as concubines for the visiting 
   Japanese dignitaries (everyone knows how those Japs love their white 
   women!). With the help of Lt. Jennifer West (Karen Ericson; John's 
   real-life wife), Stony and Paco pick four women: death row inmate 
   Rose (Nory Wright), terminally ill Anna (Johanna Raunio), rape victim 
   Sonya (Lisa Lorena) and prostitute Cindy Lee (Lynda Sinclaire), to 
   &quot;volunteer&quot; for the mission. First the women have to be 
   trained in the finer arts of combat (both weapons and hand-to-hand) 
   and how to be high-class hookers (Cindy Lee has the upper hand here 
   and offers to show the rest how it's done). After the girls go 
   through extensive combat and prostitute training, Colonel Blake 
   (insert <B><A HREF="mash_tv_series_1972-1983.htm">M*A*S*H</A></B> 
   joke here) still isn't convinced that they can perform their mission 
   (&quot;Women cannot overpower men!&quot;), so he talks the General 
   into calling the mission off. The girls change the General's mind 
   when they single-handedly overpower all the men on the base 
   (including a very embarrassed Colonel Blake), leaving them tied-up in 
   their beds. The women and Paco then leave their base in Australia and 
   parachute onto the island, where Paco and his freedom fighters assist 
   the four women into joining a brothel run by Madam Colleen, which is 
   frequented by the Japanese occupied forces. The girls are im<A HREF="hustler_squad_1976b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hustler squad vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>mediately
    picked by the horny Japs and are taken to the stronghold, where they 
   go to a party and each are assigned as a concubine to their own 
   visiting Japanese dignitary (Anna ends up in the bedroom of an 
   understanding, Harvard-educated Japanese Admiral and Rose, the 
   horniest of the bunch, ends up with a Nip General who prematurely 
   ejaculates!). In the finale, the girls begin killing their targets on 
   the inside while Paco and his freedom fighters stage a major assault 
   from the outside. When the smoke clears, only the terminally ill Anna 
   survives, as the rest of the women and Paco die in a hail of bullets. 
   Oh, the irony of war!&nbsp; For a Filipino action flick, <B><A HREF="hustler_squad_1976.htm">HUSTLER
    SQUAD</A></B> (also known as <B><A HREF="kumander_agimat_1976.htm">KUMANDER
    AGIMAT</A></B>) is pretty slow-moving and uneventful except for the 
   violent beginning minutes and the final twenty minutes, where the 
   girls perform their mission. What happens in-between is pretty 
   standard stuff, as we get to know Stony, Paco and the women, view 
   their strenuous training regimen and watch various romantic 
   interludes, especially between Stony &amp; Jennifer and Paco &amp; 
   Anna. For a film that is so female-eccentric and full of sex talk, 
   there is very little female nudity on view. Even during the 
   prostitute training sessions, the women wear big white bras and 
   granny panties, so those looking for a lot of lurid female flesh are 
   bound to be disappointed. The violence on display is of the standard 
   bullet squib and knife-stabbing variety, but I get the feeling that 
   some of the more violent aspects of this film (including two 
   decapitations) have been severely edited. Director Cesar Gallardo (<B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#BambooGodsIronMen">BAMBOO
    GODS AND IRON MEN</A></B> - 1974) tries his best, but the screenplay 
   (which goes uncredited, but it has Ken Metcalfe's signature moves 
   written all over it) takes far too long to get to the action. There 
   are some interesting aspects here, especially the relationship 
   between Paco and the slowly dying Anna and the fatalistic finale, but 
   there's way too much dead air for the viewer to really get 
   emotionally involved. Also known as <B><A HREF="commander_stonewell_1976.htm">COMMANDER

   forces the hitman to fall on a live grenade. The terrorist then sends 
   an actual hitwoman and some goons to Agent 00's martial arts school, 
   but the black belt Agent 00 makes short order of them pretty quickly. 
   Some goons then try to kill the tiny agent in his highrise apartment, 
   but he uses a sheet as a parachute when he jumps out of his window 
   and lands in his pool (in a laugh-out-loud scene). When the Chief and 
   Agent 00 try to question the female hitwoman by injecting her with 
   sodium pentathol, she dies. Someone switched the truth serum with 
   poison. Agent 00 becomes suspicious of businessman Senior Manolo 
   Cervantes (Romy Diaz), since he always seems to be around when the 
   shit hits the fan. He's right, of course, but how can he prove it? 
   Things turn bad for Agent 00 when Senior Manolo gets him fired from 
   the case. Now, Agent 00 must &quot;unofficially&quot; investigate the 
   terrorist's dastardly plot. Have pity on poor Senior Manolo, the 
   terrorist and his men.&nbsp; This film is so goofy, you can't help 
   but like it. Director Eddie Nicart, who directed the majority of Weng

   (&quot;Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were an adult!&quot; is what 
   the proprietor of a whorehouse says to Agent 00 when he walks through 
   the door.) and, above all, action, that you can forgive some of the 
   film's glaring continuity errors (and there are plenty). Nicart also 
   throws in some female nudity (only fleeting, though), bloody bullet 
   squibs and Weng Weng's martial arts prowess (he was a real-life black 
   belt), which usually starts with a punch to the testicles followed by 
   a kick to the face and a finishing foot to the neck. It's hilarious. 
   Nicart never takes the proceedings seriously, even though people are 
   shot, blown-up, impaled or tortured. Weng Weng (a true freak of 
   nature, who sports a bowl haircut and a bashful smile) doesn't have 
   to do much acting (his dubbed voice is highly inappropriate here). He 
   spends most of his time running, jumping, romancing the ladies or 
   showing off his special brand of martial arts. The best way to 
   describe him is with one word: mesmerizing. You just can't take your 
   eyes off of him. Weng Weng (real name: Ernesto de la Cruz) died in 
   relative obscurity of a heart attack on August 29, 1992. He was only

    everyone in the convoy (which includes a couple of impressive Jeep 
   explosions, complete with human passengers), Slater discovers that 
   the gold is housed in some newfangled NASA titanium safe and no one 
   knows how to open it. The U.S. government hires Captain Oliver Moss

    RETURN</A></B> - 1980; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Demonstone">DEMONSTONE</A></B> 
   - 1989) to retrieve the gold and the eight American POW's that the 
   gold was going to be used for as payment for their release. Capt. 
   Moss puts together his old team, which includes George (Robert 
   Cespedes) and Debbie (Sherri Rose; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillerCrocodile">KILLER
    CROCODILE</A></B> - 1989), and they head deep into the Laos jungle 
   where Slater keeps his home base. There's plenty of bad blood between 
   Moss and Slater, as they served in the same unit during the Vietnam 
   War until Slater went psycho and turned rogue, killing Moss' 
   fianc&eacute;e in the process (or so Moss thought). Meanwhile, Slater 
   and his men try everything in their power to open the safe, including 
   plastic explosives, with no luck. Slater works out his frustrations 
   by raping the daughter of a Vietnam General he just killed. Moss and 
   his small band of commandos parachute into the jungle and are 
   instantly met with enemy gunfire, but are saved by a group of rebels 
   led by Sai-Kam (Michi McGee), who just happens to be Moss' 
   long-thought-to-be dead fianc&eacute;e. She is also the sister of the 
   woman that Slater is raping. (Moss is hanging in a tree by his 
   parachute during the firefight and when he finally frees himself, 
   Debbie asks him, &quot;How you feelin'?&quot; He turns to her and 
   says, &quot;Like a snake-bit, broke-leg, gut-shot dog dragging nine 
   puppies uphill! That's how I feel!&quot;). In the eight years since 
   he last saw her, Sai-Kam has become a hardened rebel, who finds it 
   hard to forgive Moss for leaving her behind. Slater decides to hide 
   the safe in a cave, not realizing that the cave is actually home to a 
   squad of Japanese samurai soldiers who have live and propagated there 
   since World War II (They don't even know WWII has ended!). Moss and 
   his squad join Sai-Kam and the rebels in their quest to locate Slater 
   and the gold when one of the POWs comes stumbling into the rebel 
   camp. He tells them that Slater is now in control of the American 
   POWs, as well as Sai-Kam's younger sister. Things come to a boil when 
   Slater gets the upper hand and captures nearly everyone.

    to the safe; it's a tattoo on his body that will magically disappear 
   if he dies (!), so Slater reluctantly agrees to work with Moss to get 
   the safe back from the Japanese. Expect a battle on a huge scale and 
   then old scores being settled.&nbsp; If you never thought you would 
   see the day that the usually wooden Sam Jones would overact wildly, 
   than this is the film for you. He's totally psychotic here, flailing 
   his arms and spitting out his lines like he's the king of madmen on 
   Madman's Day (I know it's not a real holiday, but imagine it is!). 
   The scene where he tries to blow-open the safe with explosives is a 
   classic of overstatement, as he screams at his men about having 
   $54,000,000 in gold in his possession, but is unable to touch it 
   (&quot;54 fucking million dollars! Fucking 54 million dollars! 54 
   million fucking dollars!&quot;). Jones certainly looks like he's 
   having the time of his life here and I guarantee you'll never see him

   bloody bullet squibs and exploding bodies, including Jones' memorable 
   demise), offbeat situations (The Japanese subplot is pure genius, as 
   they still have an operational Jap Zero and their hatred of 
   Americans, which has been passed from generation to generation, is 
   even more intense than the days of WWII. So much so, that the pilot 
   of the Zero turns kamikaze and flies it into an American rescue 
   helicopter!), and even a lot of intentional humor (When Moss and 
   George get into a fight early in the film, they crash through a 
   chicken coop. A short time later, they are walking down a dirt road

    am a big Jean-Claude Van Damme fan, even though after watching him 
   on several talk shows, I have come to the conclusion that he's not 
   the sharpest tool in the shed (in other words, he's stupid). Like 
   most of the 80's and 90's B+-list of action stars (Steven Seagal, 
   Dolph Lundgren, etc.), most of his later films have been released 
   direct-to-video (DTV) here in the States. Unlike most of them though,

   Van Damme returns to <A HREF="in_hell_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/in hell dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>prison,
    as he did in <B><A HREF="death_warrant_1990.htm">DEATH WARRANT</A></B> 
   (1990), and the results are entertaining as well as graphic and 
   brutal. And the fact that Van Damme hardly uses his patented martial 
   arts prowess only makes this all the more amazing. When Kyle LeBlanc 
   (Van Damme) is sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 
   killing the person responsible for the rape and murder of his wife, 
   the corrupt Slavik court system sends him to the most violent prison 
   in the Eastern Bloc. After much degradation, including witnessing 
   prison rape, getting into fights and being thrown into solitiary 
   (it's literally a shithole) where he tries to kill himself, LeBlanc 
   finally pulls himself together with the help of his brutish, but 
   well-read, new cellmate, 451 (ex-NY Giants footballer Lawrence 
   &quot;LT&quot; Taylor). After being roughed-up by some Russian mob 
   cons and seeing some of his new-found friends seriously hurt or 
   killed, he becomes an unwilling participant in a series of illegal 
   guard-sanctioned bare-knuckle fight-to-the-death boxing/wrestling 
   matches. But is LeBlanc becoming the monster that so disgusted him 
   when he first entered this hellhole? With 451 (named after the novel 
   Farenheit 451) to remind him, LeBlanc regains his humanity, just in 
   time for his big fight against ringer Valya (Michael Bailey Smith). 
   His refusal to fight and subsequent torture rally the prisoners to 
   unite against their corrupt captors. A final fight leads to an escape 
   and some well-deserved payback.&nbsp; Ringo Lam, a well-regarded Hong

   (2001) and this one, and the results have all been entertaining. Lam 
   seems to know Van Damme's strengths and weaknesses and uses them both 
   to the film's advantage. I believe Van Damme is maturing as an actor 
   which he seems to recognize as he doesn't always rely on his martial 
   arts knowledge to get to the next scene. He actually acts and seems 
   more controlled and patient on screen. The images of a moth 
   fluttering around Van Damme in solitiary and Lawrence Taylor's 
   voice-over narration are both spot-on and speak volumes about 
   solitude and redemption. The film is also highly emotional in spots 
   (Taylor's flashback as a child; Van Damme's fight with the masked 
   behemoth who was in the cell next to him while he was in solitiary) 
   and is quite effective as an action film and as social commentary. 
   This was supposed to be a big A-list film, but when the producers 
   couldn't raise the budget necessary to make it, they pared-down the 
   screenplay and made this film instead. It's one of Van Damme's best. 
   Maybe he isn't so stupid after all. Also starring Marnie Alton,

    HOT PURSUIT</A><A NAME="In Hot Pursuit"></A> (1977) -</B> Here's 
   something that could have only come from the anything-goes 70's: A 
   PG-rated action flick about smuggling marihuana across the U.S. 
   border. Real-life brothers Don &amp; Bobby Watson star as Oosh and 
   Boosh (!), two stoner hippies who have just taken a huge delivery of 
   weed from a plane out of Mexico and, with the help of a couple of 
   friends, have loaded it into their camper. Trouble is, the police

   chase ensues and a couple of police cars are wrecked (one car is 
   totaled when the landing gear of the plane hits it as it takes off) 
   as well as the camper being destroyed by a passing bulldozer. The 
   boys and the pot are seized and the police take them to jail. Boosh 
   calls his girlfriend Denise (Debbie Washington) who, in turn, calls 
   Joe King (Paul Weiner), the drug kingpin. Mr. King sets up a 
   jailbreak and rescues the boys from prison using a helicopter. They 
   are <A HREF="in_hot_pursuit_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/in hot pursuit vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>driven
    to Mr. King's house, only to discover Mr. King is no longer in 
   charge. Sandy (Sandy St. Armour), a second kingpin, has taken his 
   place. After shooting the helicopter pilot in the face (!), Sandy 
   gives Oosh and Boosh a tractor trailer and instructions to pick up 
   another planeload of pot. They make the transaction and, yep, you 
   guessed it, they are again chased by the police. They make their 
   delivery, but destroy the tractor trailer in the process. Sandy gives 
   the boys seven days to pay him back $150,000; the cost of the first 
   lost shipment and damages to the truck. The boys decide to rob an 
   armored car to get the money and they devise a plan that involves a 
   Camaro, the tractor trailer and some dynamite. Just like everything 
   else these boys do, it goes wrong and Oosh and Boosh are now trying 
   to outrun the cops in the Camaro. They wreck the Camaro, steal 
   another car and deliver the money. They pull one more big pot 
   delivery (and rip-off Sandy) before retiring from the business for 
   good. I love happy endings!&nbsp; If I were a betting man, I would be 
   willing to wager that this film was made as a big &quot;fuck 
   you!&quot; to law enforcement and I'm willing to lay odds that stars 
   Don &amp; Bobby Watson were drug-runners in real life, because they 
   sure weren't actors. One-time director/producer Jim West has 
   fashioned what is basically nothing more than a chase film, where the 
   Watson brothers outrun the cops, destroy plenty of police cars and, 
   in the film's best sequence, drive a tractor trailer through a house 
   that is being transported on the highway. I was also surprised by the 
   level of violence in this, considering it's PG rating. When the 
   helicopter pilot is shot in the face, you see a very bloody shot of 
   the aftermath. During the armored car robbery, Oosh and Boosh's two 
   friends (one of them is called &quot;Bubble Eye&quot;!) are 
   shotgunned in the chest and a guard is blown up. The problem with 
   this film is that there is an uneasy mixture of comedy and death. 
   There seems to be no repercussions (not to mention remorse) for the 
   boys' actions, whether it be destroying property, shooting at the 
   police or getting their friends killed. Everything is played in a 
   tone that goes, &quot;Look what I just got away with!&quot; This 
   shot-in-Georgia rarity (supposedly based on a true story) contains 
   bad editing (some scenes look like director West didn't have enough 
   time or money for a second take), terrible acting by a cast of 
   non-pros, banjo music, no sense of justice and, as the closing 
   credits proudly proclaims, &quot;No stunt men were used in this 
   film&quot; (it's obvious that it is indeed the Watson brothers 
   hanging off the helicopter as they are making their escape from the 
   prison). A true product of the 70's. Also known as <B><A HREF="polk_county_pot_plane_1977.htm">POLK

   the crystal. Also after the crystal is e<A HREF="karate_cop_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/karate cop dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>vil
    mutant leader Lincoln (D.W. Landingham), who sends Snaker and a 
   bunch of mutants to steal the crystal and kill Travis. Travis locates 
   and steals the crystal (from some religious mutant), but someone 
   steals his motorcycle in return. He walks into Jackass Junction and 
   stops at a bar/diner run by Dad (David Carradine). It seems Dad stole 
   stole Travis' motorcycle and he now wants the keys, but Travis kills 
   him and a bar full of mutants when they try to take them (while a 
   mutant woman in a fur bra dances next to a broken jukebox). On his 
   way back to Rachel, Snaker and his men try to ambush Travis, but he 
   gets away. He then learns that Lincoln has kidnapped Rachel, so 
   Travis must now go to Lincoln's compound to save her. After killing 
   some of Lincoln's men in an arena cage fight, he rescues Rachel, but 
   gets shot in the leg when they get away (he performs surgery on 
   himself and removes the bullet). As Lincoln and his men attack 
   Rachel's compound, she sends all the children through the teleporter 
   to safety while Travis holds the mutants at bay. He must defeat 
   Lincoln's best fighter (Michael Foley of <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Divine Enforcer">THE
    DIVINE ENFORCER</A></B> - 1991) and then kill Lincoln so Rachel and 
   the kids can truly be safe. Travis must destroy the teleporter to 
   achieve that safety, so he sets out on foot, alone (well, he does 
   have is trusty dog sidekick), for Washington, D.C..&nbsp; This film 
   is so low-budget that smoke machines are constantly used to blur out 
   the background, thereby saving money on set direction (you can 
   practically see the machines pumping out smoke at the bottom of the 
   screen in almost every scene). All logic is also thrown out the 
   window (An exposed crystal to power an expensive teleporter? I would 
   have encased that thing in bulletproof glass!). Ron Marchini (also a co-producer
    and co-scripter here) is a man of few words, as he prefers to let 
   his hands and feet do the talking. Marchini does know his limitations

   - 1988), but this film's plot is so uninvolving and preposterous 
   (What the hell are Rachel and a bunch of kids doing with one of the 
   only twenty known teleporters? Did they win it in a kickball game?), 
   you'll wonder why Travis even bothers. The makeup effects are awful 
   (Snaker's makeup in particular is laughable) and the action scenes, 
   while lively, are few and far between. David Carradine is on-screen 
   for all of two minutes and doesn't even fight Marchini. He speaks in 
   this weird Southern drawl and then takes a shotgun blast to the chest 
   after pulling a pistol on Marchini. The dialogue is also very hinky. 
   Snaker speaks like Yoda (&quot;Catch him, we must!&quot;) and 
   Marchini never says more than six words at a time. I think his 
   biggest piece of dialogue is when he says, &quot;Asshole to ashes.

   (1984) -</B> When Nighthawk (Stack Pierce) kills a guard and steals a 
   cache of automatic weapons from a National Guard armory, it sets off 
   a violent chain of events. Nighthawk's boss, Joe Marks (Cameron 
   Mitchell), orders him to kill the city's only other illegal arms 
   dealer, which results in a massacre of innocent people (including 
   children) at a Chinese restaurant. The government sends Agent Bill 
   Bryant (Richard Roundtree) to investigate the armory heist and the 
   local police assign troubled cop Lt. James Long (Leo Fong) to 
   investigate the string of robberies and killings involving the 
   automatic weapons, which are now in the hands of street gangs and 
   common criminals. Lt. Long's wife was recently raped and killed and 
   when his captain asks him to look into the killing of a woman who was 
   raped and burned on her breast (by the sadistic Marks), he keeps 
   flashing back to the death of his wife. The woman's body leads him to 
   Anita (Hope Holiday), a madame who runs a prostitution racket owned 
   by Marks. When Anita goes to Marks' house to complain, he has 
   Nighthawk shoot and kill her. When Agent Bryant's investigation of 
   the stolen weapons and Lt. Long's investigation of Marks leads them 
   both to the <A HREF="kill_point_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/kill point vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>massacre
    of an Hispanic gang, they join forces to get the guns off the 
   streets and to bring Marks down. Long goes undercover as a gun buyer 
   from Arkansas (!) and has a meeting with Marks and Nighthawk. Marks 
   (who calls Long &quot;China boy&quot;, &quot;chink&quot;, 
   &quot;slopehead&quot; and a &quot;slant-eyed bastard&quot;) sets up 
   the delivery for the next day after testing Long by having his men 
   put a beat-down on him to prove he's not a cop. At the time of 
   delivery, a greedy Nighthawk proves traitorous and slits Marks' 
   throat with a switchblade. Long brings a S.W.A.T. team with him on 
   the buy and a huge gunfight/fistfight breaks out. As Long is chasing 
   Nighthawk through a warehouse, we find out that Marks is not quite 
   dead yet, as he gets revenge on Nighthawk for ventilating his neck 
   before finally dying for good.&nbsp; Although this is pretty standard 
   low-budget 80's action fare (originally released by Crown 
   International Pictures), it does contain a crazy performance by 
   Cameron Mitchell as Marks. You won't hear this often, but he actually 
   makes the film worth seeing. He plays Marks as some psychotic gay 
   gangster, who cares more about his little pet poodle than any human 
   being. The scene where Marks (who wears flowers in his hair to match 
   his poodle's) is in a jacuzzi singing to his dog while bare-chested 
   bodybuilders work out around him (and Nighthawk makes a 
   &quot;fag&quot; remark), is worth the price of a rental or purchase 
   alone. He eventually kills the poodle when is shits on his floor, 
   proving he has no feelings for anything. To prove that he has no 
   morals, there's also another scene where he's in a diner and kills a 
   talkative waitress when she doesn't quiet her crying baby. He even 
   steals the money from the register! Leo Fong makes an unlikely action 
   hero, with his bowl haircut (with prominent bald spot) and a face 
   that looks as if it was hit with an ugly stick more than a few times. 
   His martial arts fights are awkwardly staged, but I imagine that this 
   is closer to what a real fight would look like as opposed to the 
   stylized fights in bigger-budgeted martial arts actioners. Richard 
   Roundtree is wasted and only appears in a couple of scenes. He's not 
   anywhere in sight for the final battle. Director/scripter/co-producer

   California to portray nearly all the police officers in the film 
   (including Fong's captain, who has a lot of lines), which brings a 
   sense of realism to the S.W.A.T. assaults and other police 
   procedurals. This is surprising considering the story line, where 
   gang members slaughter many innocent people in restaurants, grocery 
   stores and houses. I seriously doubt any city today would offer their 
   entire police force in a similar situation. The violence in this film 
   is brutal and some scenes (the Chinese restaurant slaughter and

   strange one: A Filipino morality tale about Muslim vs. Christian 
   beliefs disguised as a war actioner. A group of Muslim rebels, led by 
   the hot-headed Kiram Sali, attack Christian Philippine Army outposts 
   every chance they get, which angers not only Army General Alfredo 
   Basco (Eddie Garcia; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomanHunt1972">THE

   brother, Omar (Dante Varona), who doesn't believe killing is the 
   answer, even if he doesn't agree with the Christian way of life. The 
   Manila Tribune sends earnest, but wet behind the ears, female 
   reported Mitch Vasquez (Aurora Sevilla) to the troubled region to get 
   the real story and she ends up witnessing more than her young 
   Christian mind can handle. General Basco sends his best man, Captain 
   Reyes, to talk to Omar about amnesty for his brother and the rebels, 
   but when Omar talks to Kiram about the offer, he turns it down. 
   General Basco then personally goes to Omar's village to try and talk 
   some sense into him and Kiram, but it turns out to be a deadly trap 
   orchestrated by the village's evil mayor, who wants the Muslims and 
   Christians to continue fighting for his own person<A HREF="kris_commando_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/kris commando (willie milan) dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>al
    monetary gain. General Basco is slain and, of course, Kiram and the 
   rebels are blamed, which leads to an all-out holy war between the 
   Muslims and the Christians, resulting in the deaths of many innocent 
   women and children. Omar gives up his peaceful ways when the Army 
   kills Kiram and some of his own schoolchildren. Omar becomes the 
   leader of the rebel forces and unites all the different rebel clans 
   into one fighting force. The first thing Omar does is kill the mayor 
   for his treachery (and we find out that Omar is actually the bastard 
   son of General Basco!) and then he leads his fighting force on 
   attacks against the Army. General Basco's real son, Raoul, becomes a 
   Muslim-hating killing machine who leads his Army unit on many Muslim 
   village raids (even members of his own unit believe Raoul is taking 
   things too far, letting his hatred blind his humanity). The two 
   half-brothers will eventually have to face each other in final 
   combat. Who will be the winner? Are there any true winners when it 
   comes to senseless war?&nbsp; Those expecting a typical balls-out 
   Filipino war actioner are going to be severely disappointed, because <B><A HREF="kris_commando_1987b.htm">KRIS

   - 1983; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#ClashOfTheWarlords">CLASH OF 
   THE WARLORDS</A></B> - 1985) and written by Pete Pascua, is more 
   interested in theological warfare than battlefield warfare. Sure, 
   there are plenty of gunfights and bloody deaths (including small 
   children being murdered), but the viewer is also bombarded with 
   plenty of Muslim and Christian ideology, some of it pretty 
   heavy-handed, especially Mitch's plea to her soon-to-be Muslim-hating 
   Mother-In-Law (General Basco's wife) on why she wishes Muslims and 
   Christians can put their differences aside and live in a violence-free
    Philippines. Not all the symbolism is bad, though. There's an 
   excellent sequence where General Basco is being killed in the enemy 
   trap, intercut with scenes of Mitch, Raoul and the rest of the Basco 
   clan celebrating Mom's birthday in Manila. The Muslim village that 
   General Basco dies in is populated by sick and hungry women and 
   children, while a healthy Momma Basco and her clan feast on cake. 
   It's a potent sequences marked with excellent editing that magnifies 
   the differences in the two religions, but doesn't play favorites, as 
   both sides suffer equally. Most of the bloody war action is saved for 
   the final third of the film, where Omar goes into Rambo mode 
   (shirtless, but with a bandana tied around his upper arm rather than 
   his forehead) and Raoul flips out and starts killing Muslims 
   indiscriminately. There are plenty of bloody bullet squibs and even a 
   decapitation, but how action film fans view this film depends on 
   their tolerance level for religion in the storyline. It tries to play 
   fair with both sides, but Muslims have the slight edge here, thanks 
   to Christian Raoul wigging-out in the finale. I guess this film also 
   makes a good parable about War in Iraq and the difference that 
   religion plays there, but that's purely a coincidence. Or is it? Also

   freedom, avoiding border guards (one tries to rape her) and greasing 
   the palms of money-hungry locals (one also tries to rape her) in 
   order to get across the border. When she is betrayed by a group of

   to make it across the border into Lin's territory and Sheila goes in

   Red Farley is a traitor and is after the money, too. When Lin renegs 
   on the deal (he also tries to rape Sheila), Mitch again shows up and 
   saves the day. Mitch brings Lin, Sheila and Dugan to Lin's plane, but 
   when Lin breaks free, the trio must fight their way off the airfield.

   average action/jungle film with enough bloody carnage (eyes poked 
   out; ears cut off; people riddled with bullets) to make the hackneyed 
   plot (screenplay by Tito Carpi as &quot;Tony Carp&quot;) bearable. I

    January 1973, on the outskirts of Saigon: Captain Henry 
   &quot;Harry&quot; Morris (David Warbeck; Margheriti's <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#HuntersGoldenCobra">THE
    HUNTERS OF THE GOLDEN COBRA</A></B> - 1982) is cooling his heels in 
   a bar with some of his platoon, when his best friend Steve 
   (Gianfranco Moroni) begins going off the deep end, partially due to 
   the heat and partially due to PTSD, shooting a drunk soldier in the 
   head with his pistol, asking Harry where his new wife Carol is, he 
   needs to meet her now. Just when Harry has talked some sense into him 
   and has brought his mania down, the enemy starts shelling the base 
   and the area all around them starts exploding. Harry watches 
   helplessly as Steve eats his own gun, placing his pistol in his mouth 
   and pulling the trigger. Harry gets out of the bar just in time, as 
   it then explodes into smithereens and he watches as the entire base 
   explodes all around him (excellent miniature work by Margheriti, his 
   second favorite thing to do besides directing). Henry is the only 
   member of his platoon to survive the shelling and the next time we 
   see him, he is in a helicopter about to be dropped behind enemy 
   lines. The chopper begins taking enemy fire and the tail gunner is 
   killed (shot through the eye). The chopper pilot wants to call off 
   the mission, but Harry makes him touch down so he can jump off (it's 
   obvious that Harry no longer cares if he lives or dies, putting other 
   people in danger in the process). After almost being bitten by a 
   poisonous snake, Harry meets his contact, Sgt. George Washington 
   (Tony King; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Raiders Of Atlantis">THE RAIDERS 
   OF ATLANTIS</A></B> - 1983), or &quot;Wash&quot; for short. Wash 
   introduces Harry to the men who will accompany him on his mission 
   (which he won't discuss with anyone, not even the men who will 
   accompany him), but there is one person Harry wasn't expecting, 
   female war correspondent Jane Foster (Tisa Farrow; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">ANTHROPOPHAGUS</A></B> 
   - 1980), who will be documenting this mission. Harry doesn't want her 
   there, but his superiors overrule him, so he has no choice but to 
   bring her along. As they hoof it through the jungle, they find a dead 
   paratrooper rotting in a tree and avoid various spiked jungle booby 
   traps. They come upon a destroyed village, but something doesn't feel 
   right. A Vietcong woman carrying a crying baby approaches them and it 
   turns out she is a decoy for an enemy ambush. A firefight ensues, but 
   Jane doesn't seem too worried about losing her life, as she snaps 
   away with her camera, so Harry plays savior, pulling her out of 
   harm's way. Wash is seriously wounded in the ambush and Harry must 
   get him across the river so he can get some medical attention, but 
   they all must stop and take a rest break for the night. Jane tells 
   Harry her life story, but it is clear Harry doesn't want to talk 
   about his life (In Harry's mind, we see a flashback, were he is best 
   friends with Steve and his new wife Carol [Margie Newton; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellLivingDead1980">HELL
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1980], as they frolic on a beach, 
   laughing and having a good time). When morning comes, Harry and the 
   group head further in the jungle, heading for the river, but one 
   soldier is cut in half by a spiked booby trap (He has lost the entire 
   bottom of his body at the waist!), so Harry collects his dog tags and 
   pockets them. They finally make it across the river and come to a 
   remote American base, where Wash gets medical help from ad hoc doctor 
   Carlos (Bobby Rhodes; <B><A HREF="demons_1985.htm">DEMONS</A></B> - 
   1985), but an enemy sniper takes out a couple of Harry's soldiers in 
   the process. Harry talks to the commander in charge of the base, 
   Major William Cash (John Steiner; Margheriti's <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Ark Sun God">THE
    ARK OF THE SUN GOD</A></B> - 1983) and it is plain to see that Major 
   Cash has lost touch with reality. He has Harry listen to his favorite 
   &quot;music&quot;: A tape of various guns firing! Harry can see that 
   Major Cash is a sandwich short of a picnic, so when he asks Harry 
   what his mission is, he tells him he is not authorized to tell him. 
   Major Cash has lost all control of his base, as most of his men are 
   addicted to drugs and walk around in a haze and even Jane worries 
   that she is not safe around these soldiers, especially when a group 
   of them try to gang rape her. Major cash punishes the leader of the 
   group by making him run to a tree behind enemy lines and pull a 
   coconut off it! We see the soldier dodging enemy bullets and grenade 
   fire, but he retrieves the coconut and gives it to the Major. Jane 
   complains to Harry, but he does nothing, telling her, &quot;Maybe I 
   don't wanna live anymore.&quot; (Jane calls him a &quot;prick&quot;) 
   Harry then wishes Wash well (giving him cigarettes and chocolate) 
   because his injuries are serious enough to send him back to the 
   States (Wash tells Harry he doesn't smoke and the only chocolate he 
   eats is white chocolate, but Harry just smiles and walks away, 
   telling Wash he will have plenty of time to take up smoking back in 
   the U.S.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The base is then invaded by the enemy (no one is standing guard 
   because they are either drunk or stoned!) and nearly all of Cash's 
   men are massacred, including Cash, as we hear a Tokyo Rose-like voice 
   on the radio telling the American soldiers that they should be home 
   with their wives or girlfriends, not here fighting a useless war (we 
   will hear her voice a lot during this film). Jane is taken prisoner 
   by the Vietcong, while Harry fights them off with a flame-thrower. 
   The entire base explodes and the only ones to survive (besides Jane) 
   are Harry, Wash and Carlos. Harry tells Wash and Carlos that his 
   mission is to blow up an enemy radio transmitter that is broadcasting 
   those Tokyo Rose-like propaganda messages, but first they have to 
   rescue Jane. As the trio gets closer to the enemy camp, they discover 
   that there are American deserters partying with the enemy, so they go 
   in with guns blazing, killing the deserters, but Carlos is killed and 
   Wash is seriously injured again (he is shot and his foot is caught 
   between two boards as he falls, his ankle bone jutting out of the 
   skin). Harry leaves Wash on a boat, while he tries to sneak into the 
   enemy camp on his own and, wouldn't you know it, the enemy camp is 
   also where the enemy transmitter is located, so this is a &quot;two 
   birds with one stone&quot; kind of situation. Wash's boat begins 
   taking enemy fire from both side of the river and we see his leg blow 
   off at the knee when it gets hit by machinegun fire (it's the same 
   leg that he snapped his foot, so it's really not a big loss, he was 
   going to lose his foot anyway. Hey, I'm a &quot;glass half full&quot; 
   kinda guy!). Wash then loses his life when his boat catches fire and 
   he burns to death (this poor guy just cannot catch a break!). Just 
   when Harry hears Wash's death screams, he is captured by the enemy 
   and thrown into a bamboo cage in the river, where he meets an 
   American P.O.W., who is then eaten alive by rats! Harry tries to 
   fight the rats off, but just when it looks like he is about to become 
   rat chow, he is pulled out of the cage and beaten senseless by the 
   camp commander. When Harry refuses to tell him what his mission is, 
   he is stabbed in the side with a bayonet and thrown back into the 
   cage, his blood attracting a pack of swimming rats. Jane sees that 
   Harry has been brought to the camp, so she knocks out the guy 
   guarding her with a tree branch and rescues Harry, but he refuses to 
   leave the camp until he blows up the radio transmitter. Harry sees 
   something in the transmitter room that catches his eye: A photo of 
   him, Steve and Carol at the beach, taped to a wall. That's right, 
   Carol is a traitor. She is the one transmitting those propaganda 
   messages over the airwaves. Harry doesn't want to hear Carol's 
   explanation on why she is doing it, he shoots and kills her for her 
   treachery. He then radios-in for a pickup and blows up the 
   transmitter. He and Jane then hightail it to the pickup location, but 
   Harry refuses to get on the helicopter, pulling off his dog tags and 
   throwing them to Jane.<A HREF="last_hunter_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/last hunter italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Harry's mission is over and so is his will to live. Jane watches as 
   the land he is sitting on explodes, realizing that Harry is through 
   fighting someone else's war.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    LAST RIDERS</A><A NAME="LastRiders1991"></A> (1991) -</B> Early PM 
   Entertainment Group production that mixes biker gangs, corrupt DEA 
   agents and revenge into a pretty satisfying brew. When two members of 
   the Slavers motorcycle gang are ripped-off for $50,000 and a kilo of 
   cocaine by a female wrestler/drug mule named Feather (Mimi Lesseos), 
   the leader of the Slavers, Rico (Angelo Tiffe), sends fellow member

   wrong when Feather's boss kills her and Johnny is forced to kill him, 
   only for Johnny to discover that Feather's boss was a crooked DEA 
   agent. Tired of the gang life, Johnny quits the Slavers and heads out 
   on the open road, just him and his Harley. On his way to Canada, 
   Johnny stops by the garage of old friend (and ex-Slavers member) 
   Hammer (William Smith; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#GentleSavage1973">GENTLE

   settle down in this small Nevada town in the middle of nowhere and 
   when he meets a woman named Anna (Kathrin Lautner) and her young 
   daughter Sammi (Mindy Martin), whose car breaks down in town, Johnny 
   falls in love and begins living a normal family life. Meanwhile, the 
   dead DEA agent's partner, Davis (Armando Sylvester), lifts one of 
   Johnny's fingerprints from the crime scene and begins his search for 
   Johnny. When Johnny and Anna head to Las Vegas to get married, things 
   begin to turn deadly. Davis comes up with a plan to dispose of Johnny 
   without pulling the trigger himself and it all involves Davis having 
   his picture taken with Johnny while he and Anna are walking on the 
   Strip in Las Vegas. Davis then uses that photo to make Rico believe 
   that Johnny has turned into a snitch, so Rico and the rest of the 
   Slavers head to Johnny's new hometown and riddle his mobile home with 
   automatic gunfire and shotgun blasts, killing Anna and Sammi. Johnny 
   then goes on a revenge spree, tracking down members of the Slavers 
   and killing them one-by-one until only Rico is left. If you think you 
   know how it's going to end, think again, because living the life of a 
   biker is a code most people will never understand.&nbsp; This

   contains a pretty decent performance by Erik Estrada (who usually 
   underplays or over-emotes in films like this). Somehow, he finds the 
   right balance here and you really care about his character. Big Bill 
   Smith is also good as the gruff, but sympathetic, Hammer, who sets 
   Johnny straight on matters of the heart, but is still tough enough to 
   beat the crap out of two drunks who put hands on his wife. Those 
   expecting a non-stop PM actionfest will be severely disappointed, as 
   Merhi and his co-scripters Ray Garmon and Addison Randall (who 
   appears here as a Slavers gang member) are more interested in making 
   a character piece rather than a full-out action flick. That's not to 
   say there isn't any action, though, as there are plenty of bloody 
   bullet squibs, stabbings, explosions and one scene where Johnny kills 
   a guy by slamming his throat down on the top of a chain link fence 
   (ouch!). This film also gets bonus points for showing Johnny's 
   revenge spree as a montage of deaths that are intercut with clips of 
   a female bar band (The Shebas) singing a song titled &quot;Walking To 
   The Beat Of A Drum&quot; (not a bad song, by the way) and for not 
   copping out in the finale. When Rico finds out that Johnny was 
   set-up, he kills Davis himself, even though Johnny has killed all his 
   friends. Johnny and Rico then face each other on their Harleys, give 
   each other a knowing look and continue on their separate journeys. 
   Not your typical PM-style ending. I went into this film expecting 
   something completely different and it left me pleasantly surprised. 
   This alternative look at the biker mythos is not a bad way to spend 
   87 minutes. Co-produced and Photographed by PM Entertainment 
   co-founder Richard Pepin. Also starring Gary Groomes, Red Horton and

    LETHAL HUNT</A><A NAME="LethalHunt1985"></A> (1985) -</B> Here's a 
   little-seen Filipino actioner that's bloody as hell. Police detective 
   Ben Serrano (Fernando Poe, Jr.) and his partner break up a robbery in 
   progress, which results in Ben's partner being killed when he takes a 
   shotgun blast to the face (Just before he dies, he says, &quot;Ben, 
   I'm not feeling good. I'm so badly wounded! Well, tonight I will not 
   be able...to taste your wife's cooking!&quot;). Ben gets even by 
   shooting all the bad guys in the head, but he gets shot in the arm 
   when one bad guy turns out to be not as dead as he thought. As he is 
   recuperating at home (where his nagging pregnant wife begs him to 
   quit the force), he is attacked by some more bad guys dressed as 
   garbage men (When Ben asks one of the guys why he is knocking on his 
   front door to collect the garbage, the bad guy replies, &quot;We've 
   improved our service!). Ben manages to shoot all the bad guys (one 
   even takes a bullet to the groin) as his wife cries uncontrollably. 
   Back on the force, Ben gets into a car chase/shootout with a bunch of 
   robbery suspects, which results in Ben crashing into a Mercedes Benz 
   containing rich bitch (and Mob connected) Dona Lucila (Armida 
   Siguion-Reyna) and her daughter Leslie, who is killed in the crash 
   (Dona Lucila orders her driver to run a red light, by saying, 
   &quot;It's only a foolish old red light!&quot;, so the crash is 
   really her fault). Dona Lucila uses her money, family and influence 
   to exact revenge on Ben, paying off a top cop to lie in court so Ben 
   gets convicted of vehicular homicide and is sentenced to twelve years 
   in prison. To cover her tracks, Dona Lucila has the lying cop killed

   testimony. While in prison, Ben's wife dies while giving birth to a 
   baby boy. Two years later, Ben is paroled from prison for good 
   behavior, which doesn't sit too well with Dona Lucila. After firing 
   her lawyer, Dona orders her people (including her sons) to kill Ben, 
   but he has moved from busy Manila to his brother's farm in a small 
   town in the mountains, where he hopes to raise his young son, Rico 
   (Jeffrey Picar), in peace. As you can probably tell, that's not going 
   to happen. Not only does Ben have to deal with Dona Lucila and her 
   goons, he must now contend with evil Mayor Ledesma (George Estregan), 
   since Ben's brother is running against him for mayor in the upcoming 
   election. When Ben's brother and dozens of his supporters are 
   viciously gunned-down in an ambush, Ben puts away his newly-acquired 
   pacifist ideals and straps on the guns again, looking for some

   contains plenty of bloody violence (mostly of the bullet kind, 
   although one guy gets a spear through his neck and another gets one

   Lucila is a bloodthirsty broad who holds grudges for life, even

   the legs or head (some bad guys get both) or grieving over the loss 
   of loved ones, but he does have a screen presence that can't be 
   denied. I can see why he was one of the Philippines' most beloved 
   actors (where he was affectionately nicknamed &quot;Da King&quot;) 
   for over forty years until his death in 2004, the same year he ran 
   for President of the Philippines and lost in a highly controversial 
   election that brought a public outcry of fraud. This film's best and 
   most tense scene comes when a drunk Greggy (Greggy Liwag), Dona 
   Lucila's son, tortures a tied-up Ben by playing a game of Russian 
   Roulette with Ben's son, Rico. Since this is the Philippines, you 
   don't know what the outcome will be (they have no problem showing 
   kids being killed on-screen), which makes the following few minutes a 
   nail-biter. Thankfully, things turn out for the best (Ben breaks free 
   and puts a bullet into Greggy's forehead) but, a few minutes later, 
   Rico's life is threatened again, this time by a (real) cobra as he 
   and Ben escape into the jungle. Pushing the limits of plausibility, 
   Ben then finds a plane that has crashed into the jungle years earlier 
   and uses various items on-board to fashion boobytraps and molotov 
   cocktails to kill the throngs of Dona Lucila's men out to kill him 
   and his son. One of the bad guys uses a three barreled machine gun/rocket
    launcher that must be seen to be believed (and you just know it's 
   going to end up in Ben's possession before the film is done). <B>THE

   low-budget Filipino action film that's low on logic (Ben has only 
   been in prison for two years, but when he gets out, his son looks to 
   be at least four years old!) but more than makes up for with mindless 
   violence and a high bodycount. Also starring Michael St. James,

   mind-boggling Indonesian action film opens with a portly black dude 
   driving his Jeep through the window of the top floor of a high-rise 
   building (We don't know how he does it, though it's implied that he's 
   driven the Jeep off the roof of another building that's clearly over

   finds a locked desk drawer or cabinet, he simply opens it by shooting 
   his machine gun and riddling it with bullets). When he realizes that 
   someone has already left with the microfilm, he radios down to 
   another guy waiting in a black pickup truck and a short car chase 
   ensues over the opening credits. The bad guys get the microfilm when 
   they shoot out the car's tires and it crashes into some parked cars

   dollars, but when competing buyer Frank Gordon (Mike Abbott) phones 
   Selick and offers five million dollars, Selick renegs on the deal. 
   Frank Gordon never intended on paying the money, as he sends a bunch 
   of his goons to Selick's building armed with machine guns (a 
   recurring theme) and shoot up the place. During the ruckus, Jake 
   saves the life of Janet (Ida Iasha), Selick's assistant, when he rams 
   his Jeep (another recurring theme) into the door of a getaway car 
   where Janet was being held hostage, graphically crushing the leg of a 
   bad guy. Jake chases some more of Gordon's guys (He shots one guy in 
   the ankle and then Jake falls three stories, crashing through 
   scaffolding at every floor, and he gets up without a scratch!), 
   following a blood trial of a wounded bad guy, which leads him to a 
   temple basement, where Jake shows his martial arts prowess (in a 
   sequence that must be seen to be believed) until some guys throw a 
   net around him. Jake is tied up and tortured with electricity by 
   Gordon himself (Who we see moments before kill Selick by hitting him 
   with a car and then running the car through a brick wall with Selick 
   still on the hood!), but when Jake won't talk (Gordon says to him, 
   &quot;OK, die a motherfucking nobody!&quot;), Gordon orders his men 
   to blow up the building with dynamite. Jake's partner, Roy (Roy 
   Marten), arrives in the nick of time and frees Jake just before the 
   building blows up. Gordon's boss, Adam (Bill &quot;Superfoot&quot; 
   Wallace, who sometimes walks around with a monkey or a falcon on his 
   arm), shows his displeasure of Jake getting away by beating the shit 
   out of the two men responsible for the fuck-up and then feeding them 
   to his dogs! An injured Jake goes to his master's temple to recover 
   and, once he is well, he goes out on a date with Janet (She calls him 
   a &quot;lethal hunter&quot; just before they make love and then take 
   a clothed shower together!). The next morning, a couple of Gordon's 
   men grab Janet and Jake gives chase in his car. Jake's car explodes 
   in the ensuing chase, so he steals on an oil truck (which leads to a 
   comedic &quot;men ducking in a ditch&quot; gag that dates back to 
   silent films!) and rescues Janet, but she ends up in the hospital 
   (Jake's efficient, but he's not gentle!). Since both Jake and Gordon 
   think Janet knows the location of the missing microfilm (We know 
   where it is, since Selick gives Janet a gift in the beginning of the 
   film), Gordon's men, disguised as emergency technicians, grab Janet 
   out of the hospital and whisk her away by helicopter. Jake gives 
   chase in his own helicopter (Man, this film has it all!) and, when he 
   spots Adam in the other helicopter (for some reason he calls him 
   &quot;Judas&quot;), a gunfight happens in mid-air and Janet falls out 
   of the helicopter into the lake below (don't worry she's OK!). Janet 
   swims to shore, but Adam shoots her in the shoulder. Jake rescues her 
   and Adam gets away, but he's pissed. Jake takes Janet to his master's 
   temple to recuperate (hey, it worked for him!). Jake and Roy discuss 
   Adam at a outdoor caf&eacute;, where we learn that under the code 
   name &quot;Judas&quot;, Adam tried to rob and blow up Wall Street 
   (Jake says. &quot;He thinks he's Lex Luthor!&quot;). Suddenly, they 
   are attacked by a half-dozen men to keep them occupied while Adam and 
   a bunch of guys attack Jack's master's temple and kidnap Janet 
   (again). While the master and Adam fight it out, Gordon shows up and 
   shoots the master, killing him (Adam yells out &quot;You 
   asshole!&quot; to Gordon, because he wanted to defeat the master on 
   his own). Adam brings Janet back to his place, where he smacks her 
   around and wants her to tell him where the microfilm is (He says to 
   her, &quot;The only thing worse than talking is wasting time!&quot; 
   which is, quite frankly, a head-scratcher). Adam can't make her talk, 
   so Gordon<A HREF="american_hunter_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american hunter aka lethal hunter german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   gives it a try (Adam say's to him &quot;Screw it up and you both 
   die!&quot;). Gordon lathers her neck with shaving cream and proceeds 
   to shave her neck with a strait razor! When she still won't talk, 
   Adam and Gordon think that Jake has the microfilm, so they set up a 
   meeting with him at a restaurant to capture him (again). They fail 
   (Jake beats three thugs up in the men's room) and Jake jumps on the 
   roof of a bad guy's car and forces it to crash through a crowded 
   grocery store, narrowly missing a baby girl! Adam loses it and kills 
   Gordon when he thinks that Gordon actually has the microfilm (A few 
   moments earlier, we see Gordon making out with a whore and we hear 
   this exchange: Whore: &quot;Last night I dreamt a snake bit me!&quot; 
   Gordon: &quot;Was it black or brown? If it was brown it was 
   me!&quot;). The police and Jake surround Adam's compound, rescue 
   Janet and Adam rigs his compound to explode as he escapes. Jake hops 
   on a dirt bike and gives chase (By God, this film really does have it 
   all!). Adam jumps on a passing train and Jake jumps on the train 
   using the dirt bike (He lands in the aisle of a passenger car!). Jake 
   and Adam get into a fight and Adam ends up getting killed when he 
   falls off the train. Or does he? At a banquet celebrating Jake's 
   success, a battered Adam resurfaces (Jake says to him, &quot;Well, 
   looks like you just don't know how to die!&quot;) just as Janet 
   discovers the hidden microfilm. Jake and Adam face-off again, only 
   this time there's no doubt that Adam's dead, since he gets impaled by 
   a table leg in the stomach (As Roy bursts through the door, Jake 
   deadpans, &quot;I found Adam's body!&quot;). The world (and Wall 
   Street) is finally safe.&nbsp; All hail the brilliance that is 
   director Arizal! Working with his long-time team of producer Gope T. 
   Samtani (of Rapi Films) and scripter Deddy Armand, responsible for <B><A HREF="action.htm#SpecialSilencers">SPECIAL

   (1984) and <B><A HREF="action.htm#Final Score">FINAL SCORE</A></B> 
   (1986), Arizal has fashioned another hyper-kinetic, non-stop action 
   film that never lets up from the get-go. It's filled with funny 
   dialogue (a lot of it intentional), stunts, chases of every kind and 
   violence that's simply amazing. My description of the film just 
   scratches the surface and I must say that I was laughing out loud 
   most of the time, due to the crazy situations and absurd 
   dialogue.&nbsp; The stoic Chris Mitchum (who could never be accused 
   of actually acting) looks like he is having a great time and, besides 
   a few back flips and a couple of dangerous stunts, looks to be doing 
   all the fight scenes himself, sans a stunt double (If you look close 
   enough, you can spot Mitchum and Roy Marten jumping into mattresses 
   when the building explodes after Marten rescues him). This is 
   Mitchum's second-best film, right behind <B>FINAL SCORE</B> (I doubt 
   any Indonesian action film could top that one!) and it's apparent 
   that he and Arizal had a good working relationship. Peter O'Brian (<B>THE
    STABILIZER</B> - 1984; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Intruder1986">THE INTRUDER</A></B>

   August Melasz, Leo Chandra, Atin Martino, Eddy Yonathan and Kiki 
   Fatmala. The print I viewed was sourced from a Greek-subtitled VHS

   rights to films like this? With the right advertising campaign and

   Oklahoma-lensed regional actioner. Three armed bandits are on a

   &quot;Mini Mart Killers&quot;), leaving dead bodies in their wake. 
   The killers' next stop is a gas station/convenience store in Edmond, 
   Oklahoma (just before arriving at the store, Billy Logan [Johnny

   headstones at the local cemetery), where they kill an old man and his 
   wife behind the counter (offscreen), just as patrol officers Cliff 
   Madlock (Larry Williams) and partner Jeff Evans (Barry Brown) arrive 
   for a cup of coffee. Cliff kills Billy immediately and Jeff Captures 
   Bartel (Tom Ward), but Zeke (Kenny McCabe), the last of the Mini Mart 
   Killers, escapes through the back door. Cliff and Jeff then do <A HREF="lethal_justice_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lethal justice spanish vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>something
    extraordinary: Instead of reading Bartel his rights, they kill him 
   (offscreen) and are hailed as heroes. Meanwhile, Zeke has holed-up in 
   the home Jim Jacobs (Guy Smith), an elderly resident of Edmond who 
   gets no visitors. After Zeke kills Jim (offscreen), he uses the house 
   as his hideout, planning his revenge on Cliff and Jeff for killing 
   Bartel in cold blood. Nosy magazine reporter Jill Weatherby (Jodi 
   Russell) smells a rat and begins pestering Cliff and Jeff for the 
   truth. Jill tries to get close to Cliff (his wife and young daughter 
   were killed in a car wreck a few years ago) and notices he has a 
   rather broad view on what constitutes &quot;justice&quot;, but Cliff 
   is savvy to her tactics. She secretly follows Cliff as he tracks a 
   young, black drug dealer back to his house (where he is watching the 
   director of this film's earlier horror flick <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Offerings">OFFERINGS</A></B> 
   - 1988) and she watches as Cliff and some other police officers force-feed
    drain cleaner to the drug dealer and then steal his drug stash. It 
   seems the entire Edmond police force is as crooked as a corkscrew, so 
   when Jill goes to the Mayor (Charlie Dickerson) to report what she 
   has just witnessed, she doesn't realize that the Mayor is just as 
   crooked (if not more so) than the cops. The Mayor tells police chief 
   Bates (Dwight Scott), Cliff and Jeff that they must find Zeke but not 
   kill him because, if the do, Jill will write a story exposing them 
   all. Zeke kidnaps old man Jacobs' granddaughter (Jennifer Kukuk), but 
   when he tries to rape her (offscreen), she escapes and flags down 
   Cliff, who just happens to be driving by (Holy coincidence, Batman!). 
   A shootout occurs between Cliff and Zeke (both are shot and injured), 
   but Zeke escapes (after a Mexican standoff where he holds a gun to a 
   small girl's head) and steals Cliff's police car. Zeke heads to 
   Cliff's house, where he kills Cliff's sister, Linda (Debbie Potter), 
   and her husband, Jim (Guy Smith). He then calls Jill (after finding 
   her phone number in Cliff's house) and offers her an interview where 
   he will tell her everything. Can Cliff and the Edmond police force 
   silence Zeke before their dirty little secret leaks out to the rest 
   of the world?&nbsp; This no-budget actioner, directed/produced/written
    by Christopher Reynolds (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Day of Judgment">A
    DAY OF JUDGMENT</A></B> - 1981; the aforementioned <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Offerings">OFFERINGS</A></B> 
   - 1988), is very short in the action and violence department (too 
   many of the killings occur offscreen), but it tries to make a 
   statement about crime in small town America. Mainly, if the police 
   take the law into their own hands under the guise of making their 
   town &quot;safe&quot;, are they any better than the drug dealers and 
   murderers that actually commit the crimes? At what point do you cross 
   that invisible line in the sand and realize that it is too late to 
   turn back? While Reynolds isn't completely successful in his task 
   (the acting ranges from awful to simply bearable and the action 
   scenes, what little there are of them, are haphazardly executed), he 
   does manage to raise some valid questions. It's just too bad that the 
   budget, the cop-out finale and some of the outrageous actions of the 
   characters (When Zeke runs out of bullets, he throws his gun at 
   Cliff, like it's an episode of the <B><A HREF="superman_and_the_mole_men_1953.htm">SUPERMAN</A></B>

   not to say that <B>LOCKDOWN</B> isn't a complete mess, it is; it's 
   just an entertaining one. Detective Ron Taylor (Chris DeRose, who 
   bears a striking resemblance to a mulleted Hank Azaria) and his 
   partner Mac Maguire (Chuck Jeffreys; <B><A HREF="blood_street_1990.htm">BLOOD
    STREET</A></B> - 1990) are after drug kingpin James Garrett (Richard 
   Lynch; <B><A HREF="premonition_1975.htm">THE PREMONITION</A></B> - 
   1975) for killing rival drug dealers and murdering a rookie police 
   officer. This leads to a car chase that ends with a shootout in an 
   apartment building, where Garrett shoots his own accomplice with 
   Ron's gun (after knocking Ron out cold), making it look like Ron shot 
   an unarmed man (Garrett tells the rest of his gang that he had to 
   shoot his own man because Ron was crazy and relentless: &quot;He was 
   a Pound short of a Shilling!&quot;). Ron is convicted in court<A HREF="lockdown_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lockdown dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   on first-degree murder charges and sent to a maximum-security federal 
   prison for a term of fifteen years-to-life. Ron shares a cell with ex-professional
    baseball player Dieter (Joe Estevez; <B><A HREF="#ArmedForAction">ARMED
    FOR ACTION</A></B> - 1992), while ex-partner Mac has to defend 
   himself from other cops who think he's a rat for turning Ron in. 
   While Ron is in prison fighting for his life from a gang led by 
   Shanks (Gary Kalpakoff), Garrett is disposing of his competition with 
   shotgun blasts and explosives and Mac is trying to clear Ron's good 
   name (There's one truly embarrassing sequence where Mac goes 
   undercover at an auto junkyard and he goes into a sub-level Eddie 
   Murphy routine that will have you staring at the screen speechless in 
   disbelief!). After several attempts on his life (the crooked warden 
   looks the other way because he is on Garrett's payroll) and receiving 
   one of Mac's ears in the mail (courtesy of Garrett), Ron escapes from 
   prison (by using that old prison escape standby: hiding under a 
   laundry truck!) looking for some payback and to clear his name. In 
   the completely under-whelming finale, Ron shoots Garrett in front of 
   a bunch of police officers before realizing that Mac is still alive 
   (Mac cracks a hard of hearing joke!). Thankfully, Ron is able to walk 
   away a free man and ends up in the arms of his loving wife Monica 
   (Elizabeth Kaitan; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Nightwish1988">NIGHTWISH</A></B> 
   - 1988) and young daughter. Anyone have a tissue handy?&nbsp; Besides 
   having one of the most under-populated prisons in movie history 
   (complete with a lone black homosexual prisoner who must feel very 
   out-of-place!), a star who couldn't act his way out of a paper bag 
   (Chris DeRose was also featured as &quot;Apprehender&quot; Brandt in 
   director Harris' <B>AFTERSHOCK</B>) and some awfully-staged action 
   scenes (a Harris trademark), <B><A HREF="lockdown_1990b.htm">LOCKDOWN</A></B> 
   is still a watchable hodgepodge of prison and action clich&eacute;s 
   thanks to some of the characters' strange predilections. Garrett is 
   just crazy about cars, especially fancy sports and luxury cars and 
   Dieter talks about everything in life as if it were a baseball game. 
   His explanation to Ron about why he is in prison is hilarious (he 
   killed an umpire when he was called out on strikes!). The storyline 
   (screenplay by Joe Izzo Jr. and Joe Mangelli) also veers into some 
   very weird directions and there are some very odd music choices 
   during death scenes (you'll know what I'm talking about when you 
   watch the film). The violence is fairly restrained for an 80's action 
   flick (yes, I know this bears a 1990 production date, but it's very 
   80's in its execution) and just when you think it's about to get 
   gory, such as when Shanks is about to get a hole drilled in his 
   noggin, Ron steps in and stops it from happening. If you are looking 
   for a non-stop gunfight or slugfest actioner, you might as well look 
   somewhere else, but those willing to overlook this film's many 
   under-budgeted distractions may have a good time with this. Frank 
   Harris directed one other film (a 1993 drama titled <B>GIRL TALK</B>) 
   before returning to his regular profession: cinematographer on other 
   people's films (such as Efron C. Pinon's terrible <B><A HREF="#Transformed2003">TRANSFORMED</A></B>

   and a platoon of American soldiers, led by Lt. Oliver (James

   - 1992, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Tony S. Suwat), are 
   trapped behind enemy lines in the jungles of Kampuchea trying to make 
   it safely across the Thailand border. They discover an ancient temple 
   hidden in the jungle during a torrential thunderstorm, when suddenly 
   a bolt of lightning blasts through the temple, revealing a solid gold 
   idol as big as a human being. Lt. Oliver orders his men to take the 
   idol with them and promises that when the war is over, they will all 
   share in the riches. They stash the idol in a cave until the war is 
   over, but Lt. Oliver gets greedy and guns down all his men in the 
   cave, except for Sgt. Kurt (Erik Estrada; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Light Blast">LIGHT
    BLAST</A></B> - 1985; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Alien Seed">ALIEN

   blows up the entrance of the cave, as Sgt. Kurt floats unconscious

    and stays with her in Thailand. Eight years pass and Oliver, now a 
   civilian, returns to Thailand to retrieve his precious idol. The 
   trouble is, he can't remember the cave's location, so he puts 
   together a team, including brawny German musclehead Christoph 
   (Christoph Kluppel) and a bunch of Thai mercenaries, to go back to 
   Cambodia to find it. When Oliver finds out that Kurt is still alive, 
   he kidnaps Kurt's wife and young daughter to force Kurt to locate the 
   cave. A mysterious Frenchman (Pierre Delalande) is dogging Oliver's 
   every move, even beating the crap out of Oliver's clueless Red 
   Cross&nbsp; girlfriend Kathleen (Myra Chase) and stealing Oliver's 
   map of possible cave locations. Oliver, Kurt and the rest of the 
   group begin their trek through the Cambodia jungle and, almost 
   immediately, they are taken prisoner by the North Vietnamese and 
   tortured. Kurt spills the beans about the golden idol and takes them 
   to the cave, only to discover that the idol has seemingly changed 
   location on it's own. In the explosive finale, Oliver and Kurt are 
   forced to join with the Frenchman to retrieve both the idol and 
   Kathleen, who are being held by the North Vietnamese.&nbsp; Trying to 
   describe how outlandish this film really is will only make you want 
   to see it all the more. This is a mixture of sentimentality 
   (Estrada's scene with his young daughter as they tend to a group of 
   monks that pass through their land daily is so sweet, you may turn 
   into a diabetic just by watching it), a preachy &quot;plight of the 
   refugees&quot; drama (Kathleen acts more like a sexy nun than a Red 
   Cross worker) and a super-violent action flick. Director P. (Philip) 
   Chalong (real name: Chalong Pakdivijit), who also gave us the 
   aforementioned (and similarly-themed) <B>GOLD RAIDERS</B>, as well as <B><A HREF="action.htm#HBomb">H-BOMB</A></B> 
   (1973) and <B><A HREF="kung_fu_brothers_1973.htm">KUNG FU BROTHERS</A></B> 
   (1973), can't seem to make up his mind what kind of movie he wanted 
   to make here, which only adds to it's offbeat charms. One moment it's 
   a straight action film where people are riddled with bullets or blown 
   to bits, the next moment it's a touching family drama, then it turns 
   into a POW camp torture session and finally it becomes a fantasy, 
   where the idol uses it's mystical powers to stop the enemy nasties 
   from touching it. Toss in some wild overacting (I smiled a lot when 
   the leader of the North Vietnamese soldiers says to Kathleen, 
   &quot;Fuck the world!&quot;, the same line Sylvester Stallone would 
   say to the Christian relief worker in 2008's <B><A HREF="action.htm#Rambo2008">RAMBO</A></B>),
    a truly remarkable action finale where hundreds of people are shot 
   or blown to bits (my god, all those explosions!) and one of the worst 
   bluescreen helicopter fight/explosions you're ever likely to see. <B><A HREF="lost_idol_1990c.htm">THE
    LOST IDOL</A></B> is way too long at 101 minutes, but it's so loopy 
   and all over the map that you'll never be bored. As with most Thai 
   war action films, there's also a bar fight, a midget and plenty of 
   risible dialogue (including Estrada's mind-boggling closing line) to 
   go along with the rest of the weirdness. What more could you ask for? 
   Erik Estrada was reportedly fined by the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) 
   for traveling to Thailand and appearing in this non-union film. At 
   that stage in his career, he wasn't being offered any roles in the 
   U.S., so I don't see anything wrong with simply trying to survive. 
   Fuck the SAG and more power to Estrada! He now sells land in Arkansas 
   and other swampy locations in a series of annoying infomercials on 
   TV. The SAG thinks that's OK! Also starring Sorapong Chatree, Noppol

   This is the incredibly dull story of schoolgirl Mary Ann 'Lovely' 
   Lovett (Lucinda Dooling), a teenage vigilante who kills drug dealers 
   because one dealer sold her younger brother drugs, which led to him 
   tripping out and drowning in the ocean (trying to catch an imaginary 
   tuna with his hands!). She gets the dealer that sold to her brother 
   first, kicking him in the face a couple of times and then forcing him 
   to swallow a fatal dose of his own stash. Lovely doesn't know that 
   her own musician boyfriend, Javelin Scott (Mark Holden), is working 
   for one of the biggest drug suppliers in the state, Franklin Van Dyke 
   (John Randolph), who happens to be Superintendant of Schools! Lovely 
   makes friends with school class president Steve Berringer (Michael 
   O'Leary) and saves his life when school drug dealer (and football 
   quarterback) Mantis Managian (Rick Moser) sends two of his goons, 
   Driver (Judd Omen) and Gommorah (Irwin Keyes), to kill Steve when<A HREF="lovely_but_deadly_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lovely but deadly poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   he refuses to look the other way when Mantis does his drug deals. 
   Lovely uses her vast martial arts knowledge to kick the crap out of 
   Driver and Gommorah. Lovely joins the cheerleading squad to get 
   closer to Mantis and gets invited to a huge party thrown by rich drug 
   supplier Warren Lang (Mel Novak). At the party, Lovely meets 
   &quot;Honest Charlie&quot; Gilmarten (Richard Herd), a rich retail 
   store owner who supplies the drugs to Warren and Mantis. She spies 
   Mantis making a major drug transfer with Warren and she steals some 
   of Warren's stash. Lovely gets into a catfight with Mantis' 
   girlfriend Gloria (Pamela Bryant), which catches the eye of 
   Gilmarten. He invites her to a party at his house which turns out to 
   be a party of two, as Gilmarten tries to get into Lovely's panties. 
   Lovely drops some high kicks on him instead and tries to forcefeed 
   him the drugs she stole from Warren, but Driver and Gommorah save him 
   in the nick of time and take Lovely prisoner. Gilmarten orders them 
   to kill Mantis, so they beat him up, stick him in a cardboard box and 
   shove a steam hose into the box, steaming Mantis to death (Gommorah 
   says, &quot;I hit my head and it hurts!&quot; Driver says, &quot;Why 
   don't you take an aspirin?&quot; Gommorah replies, &quot;I don't like 
   to do drugs.&quot;). Lovely is being held at a warehouse next to the 
   docks where a big shipment of drugs is about to be delivered. Warren, 
   Javelin and Gilmarten show up at the warehouse and Lovely discovers 
   Javelin's deception. Luckily, Steve followed Warren and Javelin to 
   the warehouse and he alerts her friends (the cops refuse to do 
   anything). Lovely's female kickboxing friends show up and bring 
   Warren and Gilmarten down and Lovely heads back to school to take 
   care of Javelin and Van Dyke, ridding the school of drugs once and 
   for all. Yeah, right!&nbsp; This deadly-dull action film plays like a 
   TV movie with some sex and violence thrown into the mix. Besides a 
   couple of martial arts fights and one or two topless scenes, this 
   film is a chore to sit through. Dreadfully acted and plotted

   that this is going to be a vigilante revenge film, but it quickly 
   turns into a teenage soap opera, complete with mean cheerleaders, 
   sexed-up horny teenagers and every adult shown is either scum, hates 
   kids or is weak-willed. And, oh yeah, drugs are bad for you. Even the 
   finale, where a bunch of female martial artists show up to save 
   Lovely's hide, is so horrendously-staged and badly shot, you'll be

   film was cut to achieve a PG rating for it's theatrical release and 
   was shorn of all the nudity and violence. Thankfully, the VHS version 
   is of the R-rated cut, but that doesn't make it a better film. It 
   just has boobs and a little more violence. Also starring Marie

    using much of the same talent both in front and behind the cameras. 
   When Karen Templeton (Patti Bowling) disappears from college and ends 
   up a member of the mysterious Yarakunda's (Cameron Mitchell; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Raw Force">RAW

   is a Jim Jones clone who runs a commune with convicted conwoman Karma 
   (Akosua Busia) called Unity Village, where their followers are kept 
   half-starved, work long hours on the farm and are brainwashed into a 
   new way of thinking called &quot;Universal Enlightenment&quot; (as in 
   &quot;Let me enlighten you of your family fortune&quot;). As Karen

   members include boxer Corky (frequent Fong and Mitchell collaborator 
   Stack Pierce; <B><A HREF="#Transformed2003">TRANSFORMED</A></B> - 
   2003), Latino street gang member Chico (David Cochran) and busboy 
   Sticks (Manny DeLa Pena), who has that name for a reason. Joe enters 
   Unity Village under the guise of reporter &quot;Jack Chan&quot; (!), 
   but his true identity is quickly discovered and the guards (one of 
   them portrayed by Tae-Bo shiller Billy Blanks) knock him out and 
   throw him in a room with follower Mark Sims (Paul Bogh), who tried to 
   escape the commune but was captured. Joe and Mark escape (the old 
   &quot;fake fire in the locked room&quot; trick) and flee in Joe's 
   junker of a car (it refuses to start, so Joe has to hit the engine 
   repeatedly with a lugnut wrench to get it going!). Karma sends some 
   thugs to kill Joe, but he quickly teaches them all a lesson (one thug 
   has a bunch of puppies dumped on his face and then Joe destroys their 
   Mercedes with a two-by-four and an electric metal saw while they are 
   cowering inside it!). After holding a strongman tournament in a mud 
   pit to find two more people to help him (he picks gambler Fuzzy 
   [Woody Farmer] and musclewoman Cody [Elaine Hightower]), Joe and his 
   gang raid Unity Village and rescue Karen after a very underwhelming 
   series of skirmishes, bringing her back to her appreciative Daddy.

   Stevenett) decide to head to Las Vegas for rest and relaxation, if 
   only Joe's car would start (Better spend some of your new cash on 
   another car, Joe!).&nbsp; It's hard to imagine after this synopsis 
   that <B>LOW BLOW</B> could be boring and deadly slow, but that's 
   exactly what it is. It doesn't help that director Frank Harris, who 
   also directed the much superior <B>KILLPOINT</B>, as well as <B><A HREF="#Patriot1986">THE
    PATRIOT</A></B> (1986) and <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Aftershock1989">AFTERSHOCK</A></B> 
   (1989), is working with an extremely low budget here, as the tech 
   credits, including sound recording, photography and fight 
   choreography are all exceptionally poor. I can't help but blame Leo 
   Fong (who sounds like a Texas cowboy trapped in an oriental body) for 
   the film's shortcomings, since he is the Producer and followed this 
   film with a string of vanity productions using his Joe Wong character (<B>RAPID

    STREET</A></B> - 1990), all of them technically poor and filmed on 
   less-than-shoestring budgets. Unlike <B>KILLPOINT</B>, Cameron 
   Mitchell is woefully underused here, appearing in a robe and dark 
   sunglasses (with a huge star tattooed on his cheek!) and mumbling his 
   lines like he's in an alcoholic stupor (which I don't doubt). As an 
   action film, <B><A HREF="low_blow_1986b.htm">LOW BLOW</A></B> fails 
   miserably (it's filmed on barebones sets or in bleak, colorless 
   locations), but as an unintentional comedy, it does have its moments 
   (The scene with the puppies is sure to elicit a laugh and try to 
   count how many times Fong is called &quot;Chinaman&quot; here. It 
   would make a good drinking game.). Proceed at your own risk.

    fiction films. A mad bomber (Chuck Connors) is on the loose, blowing 
   up places he holds responsible for his teenage daughter's drug 
   overdose. He blows up a high school, a hospital and a women's lib 
   meeting. The hospital bombing proves a problem for him as a rapist 
   (Neville Brand) has seen him plant the bomb as he was raping a mute 
   patient. A tough-as-nails cop (Vince Edwards), who has a low 
   tolerance for anyone breaking the law, starts a search for the rapist 
   in order to get a description of the bomber. Edwards catches Brand in 
   the act of raping another woman and thinks he's got the right person. 
   His hopes are dashed when the mute patient who could identify Brand 
   tosses herself off the hospital roof. He's forced to release Brand 
   for lack of evidence. Connors leaves messages to the police stating 
   that he feels that they are not doing their jobs and he must step in 
   to right the wrongs of the world. He admonishes people for littering, 
   takes away a guy's car keys and throws them in a mail box for almost 
   hitting him at a crosswalk and beats up two thugs who try to rob him. 
   He even goes as far as to yell at a cop and tells him to solve more 
   crimes rather than waste gas riding around in his police car! Edwards 
   hounds Brand at every turn,<A HREF="mad_bomber3_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mad bomber vhs front2 small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="95" HEIGHT="176" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   making his life miserable, until he gives up and comes up with a 
   sketch of Connors. With the sketch in hand, Edwards goes to the 
   hospital where a nurse identifies Connors. The police raid his house 
   but he is not there. Edwards questions Connors' ex-wife (Cynthia 
   McAdams) and tells him the sordid story about their daughter dying of 
   a drug overdose. Connors gets even with Brand by blowing him up while 
   he is watching (and masturbating to) pornographic films of his wife 
   (Ilona Wilson). Edwards sets up Connors to try and bomb a newspaper 
   printing plant, but Connors becomes wise and fills a van with enough 
   dynamite to blow up a city block. He intends to drive through the 
   most populated part of the city and blow up the van. The police 
   follow the van but keep their distance hoping that they will not piss 
   him off and blow up the van. Edwards gets a lookalike for Connors' 
   daughter and sets her up walking the route that Connors is driving. 
   Connors spots her, takes a bomb out of the van and gets shot by 
   Edwards. Connors then blows himself up, ending the madness. <B><A HREF="mad_bomber2_1972.htm">THE

   one. The late Chuck Connors, with his coke bottle eyeglasses and 
   no-nonsense attitude, chews up the scenery and looks like he's 
   enjoying it. The late Vince Edwards walks around like he has a salami 
   stuck up his ass and it works here. The late Neville Brand is 
   absolute slimey as the rapist. Realizing that all the major actors in 
   this film are dead (and Bert Gordon is 84 years old as of this

    mercenary Nick McCormick (Oliver Reed) to track down Victor and kill 
   him. Victor demands one million dollars from Whitaker, who stiffs him 
   and fills the bag with blank paper. Victor (whose motive is never 
   explained but may have something to do with illegal land grabbing 
   from the Indians by the rich white men) then kills everyone in 
   Whitaker's security compound and demands four million dollars or he 
   will kill every rich person and cop in town (Paradise boasts 
   &quot;more millionaires per square mile than any other town&quot; 
   according to one character). McCormick hires a man called Tracker 
   (Jim Mitchum, who is underused here and looks extremely bored, 
   although you can never tell with a Mitchum) to help him find Victor. 
   McCormick also falls in love with local reporter Cindy Simmons 
   (Deborah Raffin), who is clueless as to what is going on. There's a 
   car and motorcycle chase, several more crossbow killings and a final 
   showdown between between Whitaker and Victor before this all ends and 
   none of it makes much sense. It looks like director Richard Compton (<B><A HREF="ravagers_1979.htm">RAVAGERS</A></B>

   killings are edited in such a way as not to go beyond it's PG rating 
   and it looks like bits of the movie were cut out that would explain 
   several major plot holes. Reed's character comes off as an asshole in 
   the beginning but changes character as soon as he beds Raffin. It's 
   pretty confusing about who you should be rooting for here. Victor 
   dresses as an Indian when he kills but it's not clear if he's of 
   Indian descent, although one cop recognizes him as a failed Olympic 
   athelete. Mitchum is always riding around with an old Indian (his 
   Grandfather) in his pickup truck, but he's given nothing to do. It's 
   Whitman who saves the film, being a slimey, money-grubbing 
   meglomaniac who will stoop as low as it takes to get his way. I'm not 
   sure what Compton was going for here, but it's a muddled mess. Also

   Philippines-lensed war actioner starring many expatriate American 
   actors whose faces will be familiar to fans of this genre (It's a 
   small fan base, for sure, but there is a fan base). The film opens in 
   Central America in 1984, where Jack Mannigan (George Nicholas) leads 
   his force of commandos on an assault of a regime military base, 
   killing everyone they come in contact with (there are some astounding 
   makeup effects on view, including a couple of graphic shots to the 
   head and too many bloody bullet squibs to keep track of). They also 
   blow up every shack, building and lookout tower in their way (the 
   whole attack sequence is very well done, with some effective 
   slow-motion scenes that could give Sam Peckinpah a run for his 
   money). The local villagers are highly appreciative to Mannigan and 
   his men for freeing them from government oppression, especially local 
   girl Lucrecia (Khorshied Machalle), who is Mannigan's lover and wants 
   to go back to the States with him, but some of Mannigan's men, 
   including Aranda (Eric Hahn), Russ (Mel Davidson) and Smith (Jeff <A HREF="mannigans_force_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mannigan's force ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="317" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Griffith),
    wonder why the villagers don't make a stand and fight for 
   themselves. Later that night, a squad of government soldiers attack 
   the village, killing (rather graphically) many innocent children and 
   women in the process. As the village is being blown to smithereens, 
   an injured Mannigan, his men, Lucretia and some villagers escape into 
   the jungle. The next time we see Mannigan, it's 1988 and he's living 
   on a horse farm in the States with his fellow commandos, all retired 
   from the military. Mannigan get a visit from General Bradley (Doc 
   McCoy) and he wants Mannigan and his men to return back to Central 
   America to rescue some American hostages and to retrieve crates of 
   weapons, all being held in a prison fortress under the control of the 
   nasty General Alfuero (Mike Monty). Mannigan agrees to do the job for 
   one million dollars and puts his old team back together, with the 
   addition of one new member: karate expert Hang Kook (Tsing Tong 
   Tsai). Mannigan and his team sneak into Central America, but when 
   their contact fails to appear, it's quite clear the mission is going 
   to be anything but easy. As Mannigan and his men make the long 
   journey to General Alfuero's prison fortress, they will encounter 
   many firefights, which starts to thin-out Mannigan's team one-by-one. 
   It is Lucretia, who Mannigan hasn't seen in four years, that comes to 
   Mannigan's aide. He'll need all the help he can get when it is 
   revealed that General Bradley and his aide Randall (Anthony East) are 
   actually working with General Alfuero, making this whole mission 
   nothing but a sham and Mannigan and his men were never expected to 
   survive. When it turns out that Lucretia is General Alfuero's 
   mistress, things look dire for Mannigan, but she proves to be a good 
   girl and the remainder of Mannigan's Force take General Alfuero 
   hostage and mete out justice to those who have betrayed them.&nbsp;

   Le Carre and our old friend James Gaines (who has a cameo as a TV 
   announcer) have fashioned a film where violence is not only a way of 
   life, it's also a means to obtain the upper hand. This film doesn't 
   shy away from showing what war does to the innocents caught in the 
   crossfire. Quite the opposite, actually, it revels in it, as children 
   are shown getting shot in the head, women slaughtered and their homes 
   destroyed. Very little is left to the imagination (head violence is 
   predominately displayed) and the action scenes are very well handled. 
   There are also shocking scenes of other violence, including Smith's 
   sudden death, Bill Peters' (Jim Moss) torture, killings at the hands 
   of General Alfuero and the sprawling battle sequences. Some of the 
   acting may be amateurish (especially by lead George Nicholas), but 
   that's a very small complaint in an otherwise action-packed film. 
   Fans of Filipino actioners (and why aren't there more of us?) will 
   not be disappointed. Also starring David Anderson, Gabriel Terry and 
   Gerard Donlon. Available as part of a DVD compilation titled <B><A HREF="mercs_10_feature_film_collection.htm">MERCS:

    is that someone is not using paint in their gun and is killing off 
   the champions one-by-one. Could it be Hawk (Jeff Moldovan), the Viet 
   Nam vet who killed innocent people during the War? Samantha (Donna 
   Rosea), a cop who got her partner killed because she froze during a 
   shootout? How about De Angelo (Joe Hess), a bodyguard for a Mafia 
   bigwig? There's also a Japanase Yakuza, a couple of Puerto Rican 
   thugs and some nasty Southern Backwood Scum who don't like strangers 
   in their neck of the woods. Let's just say that the finale will have 
   you shaking your head in disbelief, as the motive for the killings 
   comes not from within the group but out of the closet (watch it and 
   you'll know what I mean). Most of the actors in this film are also 
   established stunt men and women, which adds a sense of realism to the 
   fight scenes. The fight between Moldovan and Hess towards the end of 
   the film is a standout because you can see throughout the fight that 
   it is actually them pummeling each other. There's also a bloody 
   beheading, several stabbings, martial arts fights, a paintball full 
   of acid and a healthy dose of humor. I was expecting a lot worse and 
   was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying the film 
   despite the out of left field ending. I only have one problem with 
   this film: Having played in my fair share of paintball games during 
   my younger days, I can tell you that it stings like a motherfucker 
   when you get hit with a paintball. There's a scene in the movie where 
   one of the Puerto Rican guys gets hit in the penis with a paintball 
   while taking a piss in the woods. Believe me, if that happened in 
   real life he would need to head off to the hospital immediately, not 
   shake it off like he did in the film. Nitpicking aside, this is good 
   entertainment for both mystery and action film fans. Also starring

   R.J. Reynolds using the name &quot;Jim Reynolds&quot;. Randy Grinter,

    The film opens with a rash of gangster killings in Sicily, where we 
   see a car's 8 Track player explode and an assassin pretending to be a 
   masseuse (Romano Puppo; <B><A HREF="#Contraband1980">CONTRABAND</A></B>

   the back of his head with an electric drill!&nbsp; Lo Bianco is Tony 
   Breda, a low-level crook who pretends to be a big shot and even 
   lower-level crooks believe he is a man of importance. Tony idolizes 
   big-time gangster Frankie Diomede (Van Cleef), so much so that he has 
   a giant head shot poster of Frankie hanging on his living room wall. 
   Tony's girlfriend, Orchidea (Edwige Fenech; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StrangeViceWardh71">THE
    STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH</A></B> - 1971; who is dubbed with a 
   ridiculous Brooklynese accent!), wants Tony to go straight, get a 
   real job and quit pretending that he is a gangster (She also makes 
   fun of his lack of lovemaking skills, saying, &quot;I ask for a 
   matinee and you send me to the movies!&quot;), but Tony won't listen. 
   He learns that Frankie is coming to town, so he comes up with a plan 
   to ingratiate himself into Frankie's life, meeting him at the 
   airport, but Frankie (who is a man of few words) ignores him. Tony 
   doesn't give up, following Frankie's car on his motorcycle (He 
   couldn't be more conspicuous, wearing a bright red leather outfit 
   with a white helmet!). The first stop Frankie makes is one of his 
   illegal gambling dens, where he tells the manager (Claudio Gora; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MadDog1977">MAD
    DOG</A></B> - 1977) to empty out the joint because the police are on 
   the way (The manager asks how he knows the police are on the way and 
   Frankie responds, &quot;Because I haven't called them yet!&quot;). 
   Frankie then calls the police, giving them the address of the 
   gambling den and telling them if they hurry up, they may be able to 
   catch the elusive Frankie Diomede red handed. Frankie then waits for 
   the police to arrive. When Tony hears the sirens and realizes that 
   Frankie is still in there, he goes into the den to &quot;save&quot; 
   him, only Frankie doesn't want to be saved, so Tony is arrested with 
   Frankie on illegal gambling charges and both go to the local jail, 
   Frankie getting his own private cell while Tony is thrown into a cell 
   with twenty other crooks. It turns out Frankie wanted to get arrested 
   because he needs an alibi for his plan to work. Frankie is secretly 
   let out of his cell by a paid-off police officer and he goes to the 
   home of Joe Sciti (Mario Erpichini; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   - 1974), a former friend who is setting up Frankie to take the fall 
   for the rash of murders. He forces Joe to take a dive off his terrace 
   (while on fire!), where he falls and dies on a car below. Frankie 
   then secretly returns to his cell, no one the wiser. Or so he 
   thought. Tony sees him return to his cell and Frankie is aware of it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Frankie and Tony are then thrown in prison on the gambling charges 
   and, once again, Frankie gets his own cell, complete with its own 
   comfy cushioned easy chair and a <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottle
    of J&amp;B Scotch</A>, while Tony is thrown into general population 
   with all the other hardened crooks. Frankie then gets a visit from 
   his lawyer, Massara (Fausto Tozzi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CryOfAProstitute">CRY
    OF A PROSTITUTE</A></B> - 1974), who tells Frankie that a French 
   gangster by the name Louis Annunziata (Jean Rochefort; <B><A HREF="dirty_hands_1975.htm">DIRTY
    HANDS</A></B> - 1975) is beginning to take over his territory and 
   when Frankie learns that he will have to serve three months for the 
   illegal gambling charge, he tells Massara that it is too long to 
   wait, so he better start paying off people to get him out of prison. 
   Unfortunately, Massara never gets the chance because Annunziata has 
   him kidnapped, where he is tortured by the same goon with the 
   electric drill to his knee until he gives up the name of the police 
   officer Frankie paid off so he could kill Joe Sciti, who was his 
   friend. Massara gives up the name and is then killed. On visiting 
   day, Orchidea comes to see Tony and his lawyer tells him he will be 
   freed in a couple of days. Frankie is visited by his straight-laced 
   doctor brother Sylvester (Silvano Tranquilli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainButter71">THE
    BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY</A></B> - 1971) and Frankie gives him a key 
   he has hidden in his shoe, telling Sylvester that the key is to a 
   locker at the train station and inside the locker are files that will 
   put away the entire criminal organization. Sylvester knows that it 
   would mean Frankie would be put away for a long time, too, but 
   Frankie tells him that he doesn't care, at least he will have the 
   satisfaction of putting away the killers of Massara and those who are 
   trying to set him up. As soon as Sylvester leaves the prison, he is 
   followed by Annunziata's goons, who stab him to death in a photo 
   booth (the booth then spits out photos of a dead Sylvester). 
   Annunziata now has the key and suddenly Frankie's short sentence 
   becomes a life sentence, as the police reveal to him the officer whom 
   he paid-off, telling Frankie he may want to change his testimony, he 
   no longer has an alibi in Joe Sciti's murder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Frankie loses all his prison luxuries and is thrown into general 
   population, where Annunziata plans to kill him via some violent 
   prisoners, including one unnamed prisoner (Nello Pazzafini; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenBloodOrchids72">SEVEN
    BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972) who makes life difficult for 
   Frankie. Time after time, Tony comes to Frankie's defense, but it is 
   not until he saves Frankie from an assassin's (Claudio Undari, as 
   &quot;Robert Hundar&quot;; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#CutThroatsNine1971">CUT-THROATS
    NINE</A></B> - 1971) bullet in the prison yard that Frankie begins 
   to trust him and they become friends (Well, Tony acts like they are 
   friends, but like I said before, Frankie is a man of few words, so it 
   is hard to tell). When Tony is released from prison, he comes up with 
   a plan to break Frankie out of the joint, which he does as Frankie is 
   being transferred to court. Tony steals some cars and then a truck, 
   as they head for France so Frankie can get some payback on Annunziata 
   for killing his brother. This leads to a pretty tense chase down a 
   twisting narrow mountain road as they cross the border, Frank behind 
   the wheel of the truck destroying about a dozen police cars. They 
   then meet Frankie's old friend Jeannot (Jess Hahn; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#WhiteFire1984">WHITE
    FIRE</A></B> - 1984), who sets Frankie and Tony up with some 
   weapons, leading to the tension-filled climax, as the duo battle 
   Annunziata and his goons in a fish factory/illegal drug warehouse.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   - 1977), is a very quick 85 minutes, thanks to the talents of Lee Van 
   Cleef and Tony Lo Bianco, who make quite an impression in their 
   roles. While there is plenty of humor, usually a death knell for this 
   genre, it's not the laugh-out-loud kind, but sly in its execution, 
   the majority of it pertaining to Tony's quirky character, who looks 
   at Frankie the way a groupie would look at a rock star. There are 
   many little moments that impress, such as when Orchidea throws some 
   food at Tony and it lands on Frankie's face on the poster. Tony 
   gingerly wipes the food off the poster, apologizing to Frankie, 
   telling him he knows what women are like. There is also a little 
   throwaway moment with Tony and Frankie in a car that involves the 
   car's cigarette lighter that raised a chuckle from me. The way Tony 
   looks at Frankie in prison, admiring him from afar, may give pause 
   today, but somehow Lo Bianco makes it work, not making it seem 
   strange at all. The clothes Tony wears are also comical because he 
   thinks that is what all successful gangsters wear, but he just looks 
   ridiculous and stands out like a sore thumb. There is also some 
   graphic violence on view, especially the electric power drill, which 
   Frankie uses on Annunziata's goon two-thirds into the film (drilling 
   it into his neck), making his retribution fitting for killing 
   Massara. It is the<A HREF="mean_frank_and_crazy_tony_1973.htm#EscapeFromDeathRow"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/escape from death row poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   first time Tony sees anyone killed and it affects him in a way that 
   makes him realize he is not cut out for the gangster life. The only 
   negative thing that I can come up with is the dubbing for the 
   beautiful Edwige Fenech. Not only does it take you out of the film, 
   she is also wasted in a do-nothing role, but women in these films are 
   generally there to get slapped, raped or physically assaulted, none 
   of which is done to her in this film (Hey, blame that on Italian 
   filmmakers!). Otherwise, everything gels together rather nicely, 
   making this film a recommended treat for Eurocrime fans.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   begin clearing out villages by force, but when they invade a village 
   being tended to by a white nurse named Ruth Warwick (Joanna Weinberg) 
   and kill an innocent villager, Jaunde vows revenge. D.J., who has 
   never worked with this group of mercenaries before, begins to get a 
   conscience and slowly realizes that he may be working for the wrong 
   side, especially when he witnesses Colonel Kjemba slaughter a bunch 
   of innocent men and women villagers when they refuse to reveal 
   Jaunde's location. After watching Kjemba order his men to shoot nosy

   he spots him taking photos of the slaughter, D.J. joins with Ruth to 
   try and save the villagers, much to the dismay of Virelli, who is 
   only in this for the money and couldn't give two shits about the 
   villagers' troubles (He calls Ruth a &quot;gash&quot;). Ruth 
   introduces D.J. to Jaunde , who opens D.J.'s eyes to the plight of 
   his people. Ruth and D.J. fall in love, so when Virelli orders an

   set up an ambush on his caravan, D.J. becomes the new leader of

   Colonel Kjemba and gets help from Cliff (who switches sides). The 
   finale finds mercenary battling mercenary in a battle to free Ruth 
   and save the villagers from certain genocide.&nbsp; This South 
   Africa-lensed actioner contains a good cast of pros as well as some 
   decent action scenes. Director Riki Shelach (who was assistant 
   director on director Menahem Golan's <B><A HREF="magician_of_lublin_1979.htm">THE
    MAGICIAN OF LUBLIN</A></B> [1979]; Golan and partner Yoram Globus

   of mileage out of the lush South African landscapes and people, 
   allowing Henry Cele to speak his native tongue rather than forcing 
   him to speak English, which infuses this film with much more 
   intensity and realism. There are some truly stunning and vicious 
   scenes on display, such as when Virelli and his caravan are ambushed 
   by Juande and his men. The camera pans across a field of seemingly 
   harmless boulders, only to have Juande's men suddenly jump out behind 
   them in a blink of an eye. It's an effective sequence that conveys 
   how the natives have adapted to their environment and use it to their 
   advantage. While the film is extremely violent (director Shelach has 
   a fondness for setting people on fire or blowing them to bits), this 
   is not without some humor, such as when Virelli choppers-in some 
   hookers for his men, but the women refuse to touch them until they 
   bathe (&quot;You stink!&quot;). It's always great to see Peter Fonda 
   portray a bad guy for a change and say what you want about Reb Brown (<B><A HREF="yor_the_hunter_from_the_future_1982.htm">YOR,

    OF WAR</A><A NAME="MerchantsOfWar"></A> (1988) -</B> After recently 
   watching a handful of 80's action films, one thing has become 
   abundantly clear to me: I wouldn't have given many of these films the 
   time of day back when they were released, but now, over twenty years 
   later, they hold a certain charm, thanks to the politics of the time. 
   Most of these films were made when Ronald Reagan was President, back 
   when our foreign policies were pretty rock solid and not considered a 
   joke to the rest of the world, as they are now. Back then, when we 
   said something valid and important (Such as Reagan's famous &quot;Mr. 
   Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&quot; speech), the world tended to 
   listen. Films like <B><A HREF="first_blood_1982.htm">FIRST BLOOD</A></B> 
   (1982), <B><A HREF="missing_in_action_1984.htm">MISSING IN ACTION</A></B> 
   (1984) and countless others would never have been made if Reagan 
   wasn't in office, because their political views relied greatly 
   &quot;accept no bullshit&quot; way of thinking. That's not to say he 
   was always correct (far from it), but at least the public was aware 
   what was<A HREF="merchants_of_war_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/merchants of war vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="269" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   going on, not like today where most decisions are made behind closed 
   doors by people you wouldn't trust to feed your pets. America today 
   is a society that is too scared to publicly speak their individual 
   minds, thanks to a government that feeds us fear on a daily basis, 
   often quoting &quot;national security&quot; as a way of keeping us in 
   the dark. I don't know anyone over the age of thirty that wouldn't 
   love to see this country revert back to it's 80's sensibilities (AIDS 
   and coke-fueled greed notwithstanding). What does all this have to do 
   with <B><A HREF="merchants_of_war_1988c.htm">MERCHANTS OF WAR</A></B>?
    Nothing much really (I just wanted to vent), except for it's sense 
   of camaraderie and a commitment to endanger your life to save your 
   buddies. Two ex-soldiers-turned-mercenaries, Nick Drennen (Asher 
   Brauner; <B><A HREF="treasure_of_the_moon_goddess_1987.htm">TREASURE 
   OF THE MOON GODDESS</A></B> - 1987, who also co-wrote the screenplay 
   with Eric Weston, the director of the cult horror film <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Evilspeak1981">EVILSPEAK</A></B> 
   - 1981) and Frank Kane (Jesse Vint; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#ForbiddenWorld1982">FORBIDDEN
    WORLD</A></B> - 1982), are sent to some unnamed African country to 
   assassinate a Middle eastern despot named Musa (Adrian Waldron), who 
   is secretly supplying weapons to the enemy rebel forces. Things go 
   terribly wrong when both Nick and Frank are captured and tortured by 
   Musa's soldiers. Nick escapes and returns from the States, where he 
   puts together a team to return back to Africa and rescue Frank. The 
   CIA convinces Nick to wait until they try to secure Frank's release 
   by monetary means, but when the ransom team is savagely gunned-down 
   in an African bar, Nick and his team enter Africa to save Frank's 
   life the old-fashioned way: With guns, explosives and senseless 
   violence. Nick and his team kidnap Musa and use him as leverage to 
   rescue Frank, braving leech-infected waters, boobytraps and enemy 
   forces that outnumber them twenty-to-one. Revenge and political 
   intrigue play and important role in the finale, just like most war 
   films made in the 80's.&nbsp; Though talky at times, <B><A HREF="merchants_of_war_1988b.htm">MERCHANTS
    OF WAR</A></B> does contain some gory set-pieces and a surprising 
   amount of heart for a B-action film. I particularly liked the scene 
   of Nick discovering the decapitated head of a ten year-old boy who 
   helped him escape from Musa's camp, the head laying on a table as a 
   warning for Nick when he returns to Africa. Director Peter M. 
   Makenzie (<B><A HREF="mission_manila_1987.htm">MISSION MANILA</A></B> 
   - 1987) also offers-up lots of other bloody mayhem, including 
   exploding bodies, bloody bullet squibs and throat slashings. The 
   script is also full of politically incorrect racial remarks, such as 
   when Nick calls Musa a &quot;fucking towel head&quot; or the scene 
   where Nick chases down a black assassin in an African restaurant and 
   calls him a &quot;filthy monkey&quot; just before impaling him on a 
   meat hook. Try doing that today without Al Sharpton picketing your 
   ass off. Not a bad little action film, if you don't mind plenty of 
   politics mixed in with the blood and guts. Judging by the end credits 
   (a lot of crew members have last names that begin with &quot;Van 
   Der&quot;) and the accents of some of the cast, this was filmed 
   entirely in South Africa. Also starring John Barrett (<B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#AmericanKickboxer2">AMERICAN

    VENDETTA</A><A NAME="Miami Vendetta"></A> (1986) - </B>Hey kids, 
   here's a SOV (shot on video) action film which gets everything wrong. 
   It's an action film with no action, a police procedural film with a 
   cop (who chainsmokes incessantly) with a chip on his shoulders for a 
   hero and a blood quotient that is woefully low. Just who was this 
   film made for? L.A. Detective Colin Malone (Maartin Goslins) is taken 
   off vice duty after a <A HREF="miami_vendetta_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/miami vendetta vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>questionable
    shooting and put on desk duty with homicide detective Salvatore 
   Sanchez (Frank Gargini), who is ordered to babysit him. When Colin's 
   friend Jesse, a Cuban refugee, is found dead with his fingertips cut 
   off, Colin disobeys orders and begins investigating the murder. This 
   leads to a trail of murders linked to Cubans who came to Florida in 
   1980 when Castro sent some of his worst criminals over here along 
   with the regular law-abiding citizens. The further Colin 
   investigates, the more it seems that Sanchez is involved in it 
   somehow. Sanchez immigrated from Cuba in the 70's and became an 
   American citizen, eventually becoming a cop in Miami. During the mass 
   immigration of Cubans in 1980, Sanchez was put in charge of 
   interrogating the refugees to try and weed the good ones from the bad 
   ones. He gets involved in a murder of a big Cuban criminal during 
   this time and then moves to L.A. where he becomes a homicide cop. The 
   past catches up with him and the other people who were responsible 
   for that murder as someone is killing them all and cutting off their 
   fingertips. Colin figures it out and knows who the murderer is. When 
   Sanchez comes clean with Colin, they clean up the mess and the film 
   ends with Sanchez saying that now it is the time for the truth to 
   come out. The story may sound interesting, but the execution is way 
   below sub-par. Besides being shot on video (a major no-no in my 
   book), first and only-time director/producer/screenwriter Stephen 
   Seemeyer has made <B><A HREF="miami_vendetta_1986b.htm">MIAMI VENDETTA</A></B>

   with a little bit of <B><A HREF="miami_vice_tv_series_1984-1990.htm">MIAMI
    VICE</A></B> (1984 - 1990) thrown in. Too bad it is set in 
   California as it could have used a little of Miami's colorful 
   backgrounds to liven things up. Also bad is the lack of any type of 
   action and the blood and gore is limited to a few shots of corpses 
   with their fingertips cut off and an impalement at the finale. No car 
   chases, gunfights or fistfights here, just shot after shot of Colin 
   with a cigarette in his hand or shots of his girlfriend in lingerie. 
   If you see this floating around anywhere (which I doubt you will, 
   unless you specifically look for it), just stay away and jam a roll 
   of quarters up your ass instead. It's less painful. A shout out to 
   William Wilson for sending this to me. He must think I'm a masochist

   South African-lensed actioner that is good for a few laughs, but 
   little else. After a rather confusing opening where a gunfight seems 
   to be happening at some makeshift airstrip (it concludes with a black 
   stuntman being blown sky high in a fiery explosion), we meet retired 
   black superspy Geoffrey Graves (David Broadnax; <B><A HREF="zombie_island_massacre_1984.htm">ZOMBIE
    ISLAND MASSACRE</A></B> - 1984; he also wrote the story that the 
   screenplay is based on here) as he turns down a job from his ex-boss, 
   telling him he is through with the spy business. He is then kidnapped 
   in a hotel's underground parking lot by two mob guys, who beat him up 
   (one of the mob guys says, &quot;Don't think, just listen, 
   spadehead!&quot;), but Geoffrey traps the two guys in an elevator, 
   sprays them with a fire extinguisher and throws a mini-hatchet 
   between one of the goon's legs until they give up their boss' name. 
   Geoffrey calls his ex-boss back to tell him that he has reconsidered 
   his offer, which involves a scientist called Dr. Alfred Halstead, who 
   is threatening to turn over top-secret space shuttle plans to foreign 
   buyers unless he is paid fifty million dollars. Geoffrey has to find 
   Dr. Halstead (who everyone believes has gone mad <A HREF="mister_deathman_1977b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mister deathman japan vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="321" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>due
    to his wife's death from cancer six months earlier) in South Africa, 
   bring him back to the United States and also find out who the foreign 
   buyers are. Geoffrey arrives at the South African airport in 
   Johannesburg with a briefcase supposedly containing fifty million 
   dollars in bearer bonds chained to his wrist and is immediately taken 
   for a ride on a ski tram by two bad guys. When they discover that all 
   Geoffrey has in the briefcase are copies of Fortune Magazine (!), the 
   bad guys try to torture him with a huge needle, but Geoffrey gets the 
   upper hand and kills them both (one guy takes a header off the tram 
   and crashes to the rocks below) after getting a clue as to the 
   whereabouts of Dr. Halstead. On a train ride from Capetown to Durbin, 
   Geoffrey meets a priest who tries to poison Geoffrey's drink 
   (Geoffrey does the old &quot;What's that over there?&quot; switcheroo 
   trick) and when the bad guys come to pick up his body at the next 
   stop, Geoffrey pretends to be knocked-out so the bad guys can take 
   him to their destination. That turns out to be a shack in the middle 
   of nowhere, where the bad guys plan on pumping him full of truth 
   serum, but Geoffrey once again gets the upper hand, blows up the 
   shack and gets Pamela (Lena Nicols), the only survivor, to help him. 
   Geoffrey and Pamela are joined by U.S. operative Vince (Arthur 
   Brauss) and learn from bad girl Reagan O'Leary (Myra Shelton) that 
   her boss, Mr. Vlees (Larry Taylor), is willing to turn over Dr. 
   Halstead if Geoffrey agrees to leave South Africa. Geoffrey agrees, 
   and Dr. Halstead is delivered by helicopter in a metal coffin in the 
   middle of the ocean, alive but with no recollection of where he has 
   been for the last two months. A clue the doctor gives Geoffrey about 
   a plane he heard fly overhead at the same time every day when he was 
   in captivity leads Geoffrey, Pamela and Vince to an island near 
   Madagascar. On the island, Geoffrey meets Liz Greer (Stella Stevens; <B><A HREF="cleopatra_jones_casino_of_gold_1975.htm">CLEOPATRA

   bribe Geoffrey with a Lamborghini and $50,000 if he'll come work for 
   them. Geoffrey discovers that the Lamborghini's brakes have been 
   tampered with, so he fakes his own death, but Liz catches on quick 
   and recaptures him. In the finale, Geoffrey learns that Vince is a 
   traitor and Geoffrey is chained to the rocks as high tide moves in, 
   while Mr. Vlees and Liz make their escape. Can Geoffrey get out of 
   this mess and make everyone pay? Remember the airstrip fight in the 
   beginning of the film and you already know how it ends.&nbsp; Whoo, 
   boy, is this film a pile of stinking crap! Gold crap for sure, but 
   crap nonetheless. Director Michael Moore (<B><A HREF="kill_a_dragon_1966.htm">KILL

   have no idea what constitutes an action film, as the fight scenes in <B><A HREF="mister_deathman_1977c.htm">MISTER
    DEATHMAN</A></B> look to have been choreographed and blocked by a 
   blind man (it's very easy for the viewer to see that the punches and 
   kicks miss their targets by a good foot-and-a-half). This film a 
   career low for Stella Stevens (she's done plenty of bad films, like <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Wacko">WACKO</A></B>

   DEVILS: THE BIRTH</A></B> [1993], but none of them are as awful as 
   this) and leading man David Broadnax (who passed away in 2000 at the 
   age of 57) is so flat in his line delivery, I half-expected him to 
   disappear whenever he was shown in profile. Never mind that the plot 
   makes absolutely no sense (What exactly is Geoffrey after once he has 
   Dr. Halstead in his possession? Is it space shuttle plans or merely 
   revenge for the multiple attempts on his life?); the film just seems 
   to be a nonsensical series of vignettes, as Geoffrey gets into one 
   scrape after another, such as falling out of an airplane without a 
   parachute, getting into a laughable fight in an airport, flying a 
   glider onto Mr. Vlees' island (well, you get the idea). Yet none of 
   it is exciting in the least bit, it's just boring as hell. One 
   observation: For a superspy, Geoffrey sure gets overpowered and 
   captured a lot. James Bond he ain't. Also starring Brian

   unavailable in any form on legitimate U.S. home video) that just 
   oozes that 70's vibe. When San Francisco lawyer Joe Ricco (Dean 
   Martin) gets black militant Franklin Steele (Thalmus Rasulala) off on 
   a murder charge due to phony evidence planted by members of the 
   police department, someone kills two cops by calling in a false crime 
   and then shooting the officer<A HREF="mr_ricco_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mr. ricco poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="261" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>s
    who show up to investigate. A young black boy named Luther (H.B. 
   Barnum III) witnesses the killer shotgunning the two cops in a 
   tenement building and tells his mother, who happens to be a client of 
   Ricco's. She tells Ricco that he son thinks the killer is Franklin 
   Steele, so Ricco takes Luther to the police station to make a 
   composite sketch of the killer. The sketch, along with a description 
   of a medallion the shooter was wearing around his neck, leads the 
   police to a black militant group called the Black Serpents, whose 
   leader is, you guessed it, Franklin Steele. The police put an all 
   points bulletin out on Franklin and raid the Black Serpents 
   headquarters, where crooked cop Tanner (Michael Gregory) shoots an 
   unarmed Serpents member (he then places a shotgun next to the body). 
   Franklin gets away by ducking out a secret passage, but the cops 
   arrest the dead man's brother, Purvis Mapes (Philip Michael Thomas), 
   and interrogate him back at police headquarters. Ricco takes a 
   professional interest in the case (he's continually being raked over 
   the coals by both the cops and the Press for representing Franklin 
   and springing him), but the more he digs into the case, the more it 
   looks like Franklin is innocent of the cop killings. Ricco interviews 
   Purvis' sister, Irene (Denise Nicholas), and he agrees to represent 
   Purvis. This pisses-off police Captain George Cronyn (Eugene Roche), 
   one of Ricco's oldest friends, who tells Ricco that he has to get 
   Purvis to turn-in Franklin so the whole town doesn't erupt in 
   violence. This puts a severe strain on their friendship, even though 
   Captain Cronyn knows deep-down inside that this case stinks to high 
   heaven. After a couple of attempts on Ricco's life (the shooter 
   certainly looks like Franklin, but Ricco can't be sure), Purvis is 
   brought to trial and Ricco gets him off (Even though we see Ricco in 
   court several times throughout the film, not once do we hear him 
   argue any of his cases! We only hear the verdicts and see Ricco shake 
   his clients' hands in victory.). The suspicion falls on Tanner (even 
   Capt. Cronyn thinks he's guilty), but when he ends up dead, the 
   killer turns his attention to Ricco fulltime. The finale finds the 
   real killer gunning for Ricco at a cocktail party at Denise's art 
   gallery. The killer murders Ricco's new girlfriend, Katherine 
   (Geraldine Brooks), with a shotgun blast to her back, so the normally 
   non-violent Ricco picks up a gun to get some justice of his own. The 
   killer, it turns out, is the brother (a white guy in black latex 
   makeup) of the white girl that Franklin killed, but planted evidence 
   released his sister's murderer (Franklin admits to Ricco in the 
   latter half of the film that he did kill the girl, which leads to a 
   prolonged fistfight between the two in an abandoned church). This was 
   the brother's way of punishing everyone who let his sister's murder 
   go unpunished. Sounds like a legitimate reason to me.&nbsp; This is a 
   pretty good slice of 70's cop drama, thanks to a cast of TV veterans 
   and capable direction by Paul Bogart, who was better known for <A HREF="mr._ricco_1975c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mr. ricco ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>directing
    episodes of TV series (including 97 episodes of <B><A HREF="all_in_the_family_tv_series_1968-1979.htm">ALL
    IN THE FAMILY</A></B> [1968 - 1979]). This was also Dean Martin's 
   last starring role in theatrical films (he did have guest roles in 
   the first two <B><A HREF="cannonball_run_films.htm">CANNONBALL RUN</A></B> 
   films as well as a couple of dramatic guest starring roles on TV 
   after this) and he's pretty good here playing against type (he walks 
   into a bar and orders a glass of milk!) and going nowhere without his 
   faithful little dog Hank. Martin delivers his lines with a certain 
   amount of laid-back flair and gets off some good one-liners. There's 
   no denying that he had a screen presence and it's unfortunate he 
   didn't do more dramatic roles later in his life (he died in 1995). 
   The script, by Robert Hoban, is fairly complex for a 70's 
   cop/courtroom drama, but director Bogart doesn't sacrifice the action 
   set-pieces. The shotgun attack on Ricco's apartment is very well 
   handled and even contains a humorous moment where Ricco dials 911 and 
   gets an inexperienced operator. The killer's attack at the art 
   gallery is also fairly intense and vicious and doesn't skimp on the 
   blood bullet squibs. Even though this film is rated PG, you have to 
   remember this is the 70's version of a PG rating, where blood and 
   violence (and even nudity) were allowed. My favorite scene, though, 
   is when Ricco drives into a garage and pays a guy a huge sum of money 
   to paint his red Mustang a different color in just a few minutes 
   (&quot;What color do you want?&quot; &quot;I don't care!&quot;), just 
   to throw off his police tail! He drives off a few moments later in a 
   still-wet white Mustang that wouldn't fool a retard, nevermind a cop, 
   but it works! The hilly streets and some of the more 
   &quot;unsavory&quot; locations (including an abandoned church) of 
   70's San Francisco are used to good effect, so much so, that I doubt 
   that any of the local politicians would have recommend this film as a 
   tourist video. <B><A HREF="laverne_and_shirley_tv_series_1976-1983.htm">LAVERNE

   as Ricco's wise-cracking assistant Jamison, as does John Quade, who 
   puts in a cameo as a gay racist thug who Ricco sucker-punches in a 
   bar (he did deserve it, though). Toss in a funky 70's jazz and 
   wah-wah guitar soundtrack, good cinematography and an underscored 
   sense of humor (Hank gets Ricco's snooty neighbor's dog pregnant) and 
   you'll be wondering why this film is not yet available on U.S. home

    BEHIND</A></B> series) and his squad are ambushed by the enemy in 
   the jungle, forcing them to take cover in a cave that happens to 
   contain a fortune in gold dust. Hopelessly outnumbered and ready to 
   make their last stand, Lt. Calhoun and his men are suddenly saved 
   when a flurry of arrows appear out of nowhere and kill all the enemy 
   soldiers. A tribe of natives (including a topless woman) brandishing 
   bows and spears then attack Calhoun and his men and only Calhoun and 
   double agent Trinh (Archie Adamos) are able to escape to safety (by 
   swinging across a waterfalls on a rope). It turns out the tribe is 
   controlled by a &quot;Roundeye&quot;, a Colonel Kurtz wannabe called 
   Chard (Vernon Wells; <B><A HREF="action.htm#EnemyUnseen">ENEMY UNSEEN</A></B> 
   - 1989), who takes two of Calhoun's men prisoner. When Calhoun gets 
   back to base camp and explains to General Donipha (Ken Metcalfe) that 
   he wants to return to the jungle to save his men, the General tells 
   him that he has no men to spare, but if Calhoun (who only has two 
   more weeks left to serve in the military) can come up with an 
   alternate <A HREF="nam_angels_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/nam angels dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>plan,
    he will gladly sign-off on it. While sitting in a bar wondering what 
   he can do, Calhoun spots four Hell's Angels getting into a bar fight 
   (what they are doing in Vietnam with their Harleys is never 
   explained). Calhoun gets the bright idea to recruit the Hell's 
   Angels, led by Larger (the late Rick Dean; <B><A HREF="action.htm#RaidersOfTheSun">RAIDERS
    OF THE SUN</A></B> - 1991), to head out into the jungle to save his 
   men. Rather than tell them about Chard and the natives, Calhoun 
   entices them with tales of the gold dust instead. They bite, hook, 
   line and sinker and, together with mechanic Hickman (Kevin Duffis), 
   who replaces their Harleys with Yamaha dirt bikes (the Angels nearly 
   shit bricks at the thought of riding them), they helicopter behind 
   enemy lines, hop on the Yamahas and begin the mission. Almost 
   immediately, they come under enemy fire, but the Angels prove to be 
   proficient killers, with both guns and knives. The Angels suffer 
   their first casualty when member Turko (Romy Diaz) has his arm blown 
   off by riding his motorcycle over a landmine and he dies. They learn 
   to respect both Calhoun (who is the Indiana Jones of rope 
   manipulation) and Hickman and actually begin to operate as a team. 
   Things turn bad when Chard captures the three Angels, but Calhoun and 
   Hickman save their asses, along with Calhoun's two captive squad 
   members. The Angels abandon their gold quest and instead fight 
   alongside Calhoun as they battle Chard and his bloodthirsty natives. 
   The finale finds our unlikely heroes trying to make it across a 
   rickety, broken wooden bridge, while Chard, the natives and even the 
   VC (who show up with tanks!) try their damnedest to make sure they 
   don't make it across to the other side.&nbsp; If you've seen any of 
   director Cirio H. Santiago's other Nam action flicks, such as <B><A HREF="#EyeOfTheEagle">EYE
    OF THE EAGLE</A></B> (1987), <B><A HREF="action.htm#BehindEnemyLines87">BEHIND

   (1990) and <B><A HREF="#Firehawk">FIREHAWK</A></B> (1992), you know 
   what to expect here: Lots of gunfights, explosions galore, gore 
   (including the aforementioned arm removal, slit throats and arrows 
   through the neck), some brief nudity and, of course, Santiago's 
   patented &quot;running man on fire&quot; gag. This one also contains 
   plenty of motorcycle stunts and some unexpected humor, such as when 
   the remaining Angels stand over Turko's grave and Calhoun asks them 
   to say a little something out of respect. The best they can come up 
   with is when member Bonelli (Mark Venturini) thanks Turko for making 
   the surviving members shares of gold a little larger! An interesting 
   side note is that when the real Hell's Angels heard that this film 
   used their name without permission, they successfully sued and won a 
   fairly large cash settlement. It didn't help that Rick Dean's 
   character was named &quot;Sonny Larger&quot;, which sounded too much 
   like the name of real Hell's Angels founder Sonny Barger to be a 
   coincidence. <B><A HREF="nam_angels_1988d.htm">NAM ANGELS</A></B>

   (1979, with Aldo Ray) and <B><A HREF="#YoungWarriors">YOUNG WARRIORS</A></B> 
   (1983, with Ernest Borgnine). This time it's Cameron Mitchell's turn 
   to embarass himself as Senator Hansen, whose daughter Christy 
   (Claudia Udy) is kidnapped and raped (&quot;I'm gonna make a whore 
   outta you!&quot;) by Central American terrorists. They demand the 
   senator pay a 2.5 million dollar ransom and read an on-air manifesto 
   within 72 hours decrying the U.S.'s involvement in Central America or 
   Christy will be killed. The senator and Christy's fiance Bob (Casey 
   King) refuse to do anything to help (for political and professional 
   reasons), so Christy's friends Steve (James Van Patten), Carla (Linda 
   Blair), Henry (Chad McQueen), Mack (James Marcel, who would later 
   change his name to James Wilder) and Eddie (Dean R. Miller) head down 
   to Central America to free Christy from her <A HREF="nightforce_1986b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/nightforce vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>captors.
    Once in Central America, these five fish-out-of-water enter a smokey 
   cantina and immediately get into trouble, get into a shootout, then a 
   car chase and meet Bishop (Richard Lynch, in a rare good guy role), a 
   flute-playing mercenary with a monkey sidekick who agrees to help 
   them free Christy. Estoban (Bruce Fisher, who looks like Fidel 
   Castro), the leader of the terrorists, keeps Christy tied-up and 
   half-naked in a bamboo cage, while one of Estoban's men, Raoul (Cork 
   Hubbert), takes pity on her and secretly gives her food and clothing 
   (How the hell do you secretly give someone clothing? Wouldn't Estoban 
   notice something like that?). After another shootout in a town 
   between our group and Estoban's men (where Bishop saves Carla's 
   life), Bishop captures and tortures one of Estoban's men (off-screen) 
   and gets Estoban's location. After Christy makes an unsuccessful 
   escape attempt with Raoul's help (he's killed for his treachery), 
   Bishop and the quintet invade Estoban's camp and rescue Christy, but 
   not everyone makes it out alive. The survivors must make it to a 
   waiting helicopter, but there is more carnage waiting for them there. 
   Who will survive to make it to another day? Do you really care?&nbsp; 
   Almost immediately as soon as the film starts, it's apparent (at 
   least to me) that it's going to be a rough time for the viewer. 
   Deadly slow for an action film (the first major gunfight doesn't 
   happen till past the 45 minute mark of this 82 minute film), <B><A HREF="nightforce.htm">NIGHTFORCE</A></B> 
   takes forever to find it's pulse. The action scenes are pretty good 
   when they finally happen, as people are shot, stabbed or blown up in 
   slow motion (the action scenes are probably this good because Joe 
   Tornatore [<B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Zebra Force">THE ZEBRA FORCE</A></B> 
   - 1976] was Executive In Charge Of Production here). There are so 
   many holes in the storyline (How did these kids get a Jeep and a U-Haul
    trailer full of weapons down to Central America without being 
   detected?) and unresolved sub-plots (What happened to Christy's 
   fiance or her father for that matter?) that you'll wonder how anyone 
   could take this seriously. This Vestron Films-funded production is 
   nothing but a thinly-veiled copy of Foldes' earlier <B><A HREF="#YoungWarriors">YOUNG
    WARRIORS</A></B>, starring the same wooden actor (James Van Patten) 
   and using the same behind-the-scenes talent (co-scripter Russell W. 
   Colgin and producer Victoria Paige Meyerink). Claudia Udy spends most 
   of her screen time in various states of undress (that's not a bad 
   thing) and gets raped once and near-raped a second time (not a good 
   thing). Linda Blair keeps her clothes on throughout (not even a 
   shower scene, though she does work out in a gym in a skimpy outfit) 
   and Cameron Mitchell is on-screen for less than two minutes. Blair 
   also sings the opening and closing tune, titled &quot;I Still

   store security guard and then go to the house of the female cashier, 
   who called the cops on them, and rape her and her female friend as 
   well as bashing their male friend with a baseball bat. They are 
   arrested and are then represented by hot shot defense attorney Joseph 
   Gainer (Erik Estrada), who proceeds to portray the victims as the 
   real criminals. This does not sit well with prosecuting attorney 
   Marion (Kathrin Lautner), who also happens to be the ex-wife of 
   Gainer. When the lead witness is shot and killed by the leader of the 
   gang, Carl (Isaac Allen), Marion tells the court that a new secret 
   witness has come forth to testify in the case. She's making it up, of 
   course, to trap Carl who has already hung one of his friends and shot 
   the other. When Carl comes the Marion's house to kill her, Joseph 
   shows up in the nick of time to save her and chases Carl through the 
   streets (whichs includes a patented slow-mo car flip, a PM staple), 
   both ending up in a swimming pool where Joseph drowns Carl. Joseph is 
   arrested and charged with murder. Now Joseph knows how it feels to be 
   on the other side of the fence. For a PM Entertainment production, 
   this is woefully short on action and long on courtroom procedures. 
   Director Joseph Merhi, one of the founding members of PM (which has 
   since closed up shop), keeps the violence and action to a minimum so 
   don't go looking for the usual PM fare here. Instead you'll find a 
   bored-looking Estrada walking the streets probably wondering how his 
   career has sunk this low, an unreal look of how the courts operate 
   and a cameo appearance by Joey Travolta as a sleazebag lawyer (are

   behind in a Vietnam P.O.W. camp. He wakes up with cuts and bruises as 
   if he were back in the war. With his war buddy and the help of a 
   psychiatrist (Dan Haggerty, how do you still keep getting acting

   from the netherworld into the real world. They succeed, but it all

   himself back in Vietnam. What preceeded it was all in his mind. He 
   does take matters in his own hands and kills the traitor in his

   straight and the good soldiers kill everyone with one shot apiece. 
   When bales of hay are hit with bullets, sparks fly and there are

   (co-director Romano Kristoff; <B><A HREF="#TerrorForceCommando">TERROR
    FORCE COMMANDO</A></B> - 1986), who agrees to help David retrieve 
   the formula. The formula is now in the hands of evil businessman Mr. 
   Duncan (Tony Carreon) and he will do anything to keep it. Once Duncan 
   catches wind that Kenzo is on his trail, he sends his men to kill him 
   and David. They place a bomb in David's car, but Kenzo smells it (!) 
   and they both jump out of the car seconds before it explodes (David 
   flatly says, &quot;Well, there goes my car.&quot;). Duncan tries 
   unsuccessfully to kill Kenzo on several occasions (his men shoot 
   arrows into a sleeping Kenzo's chest, but he is wearing a shield 
   under is pyjamas!), which forces Kenzo to don several disguises (in 
   one instance, he puts on a dress, a wig and huge glasses and tries to 
   pass himself off as the ugliest woman this side of the Ukraine!) to 
   find out who kidnapped Carla (Cristina Guadagno), the best friend of 
   David's sister, Laura (Jeselle Morgan). It seems a spate of 
   kidnappings of young women has been happening in the area for some 
   time and they are being used as guinea pigs by Mr. Duncan's lead 
   scientist, Professor Yamamoto (Ken Watanabe, who co-wrote the 
   screenplay with Kristoff), to test the effects of the formula (It's 
   never made abundantly clear what the formula actually does, but it 
   has something to do with LSD and mind control, turning the kidnapped 
   young women into zombified killing machines). When Mr. Duncan has 
   Laura kidnapped (who Kenzo is now quite fond of) and then kills 
   David, Kenzo goes on a revenge spree, sneaking onto Duncan's secret 
   island compound and killing everyone (including Duncan, who gets 
   decapitated in the film's bloodiest effect) and then facing-off with 
   Professor Yamamoto, who turns out to be the ninja who murdered 
   Professor Hamilton and his gimp daughter in the beginning of the 
   film.&nbsp; This is a pretty weak Filipino actioner that was clearly 
   made solely as a starring vehicle for Romano Kristoff, who makes for 
   one of the most unconvincing ninjas in recent memory. Kristoff, who 
   co-directed this with the usually competent Teddy Page (<B><A HREF="#Blood Debts">BLOOD
    DEBTS</A></B> - 1983; <B><A HREF="action.htm#JungleRats">JUNGLE RATS</A></B> 
   - 1987), makes sure to give himself plenty of screen time playing the 
   action hero, stopping the action sequences long enough to have a 
   naked love scene with Jeselle Morgan. Kristoff also adopts multiple 
   disguises, including the aforementioned woman (a laugh riot!) and an 
   elderly bearded fisherman, while spouting cringe-worthy dime store 
   Confucius bits of wisdom, like &quot;Apologies are like sunshine 
   after a hurricane...beautiful but useless!&quot; The action scenes, 
   especially the martial arts fights, are poorly staged and many of 
   them happen under the blanket of darkness, making viewing what's 
   going on a real chore. The film's not a total loss, though, thanks to 
   some gory deaths (impalement by arrow seems to be the favored method 
   here, followed by sword slicing, throat slitting and being bashed 
   over the head repeatedly with an ashtray), female nudity and some 
   truly risible dialogue (&quot;Who are you?&quot; &quot;I am your 
   executioner!&quot;). The film would have been so much better if the 
   script focused more on the illicit experiments (which held promise)

   (Who says, &quot;Sergeant Quinn, what you did last night was just 
   sensational...but for this department it's bullshit!&quot;), Mark 
   stops at a supermarket with cop buddy Jackson (James Moss) to get 
   some beer, only to discover Jackson is being held hostage in the 
   store by some robbers. Suddenly, a black-clad ninja sneaks into the 
   store and kills the robbers with some fancy swordplay before 
   disappearing out the back of the store. When Jackson follows the 
   ninja, he discovers Mark <A HREF="ninjas_force_2_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ninja's force 2 aka double edge dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>unconscious,
    apparently knocked-out by the ninja (When their Captain doesn't 
   believe the vigilante was a ninja, Jackson says, &quot;Well sir, he 
   was wearing the same damned costume as Lee Van Cleef was in his TV 
   series!&quot; to which the Captain relpies, &quot;Jesus, the next 
   thing you're gonna be telling me is that Rambo walks into McDonalds 
   and Spiderman busts him for being an unlicensed samurai!&quot; 
   What?!?). Pretty soon, the ninja begins showing up at the scenes of 
   crimes in progress, disabling the criminals (when he doesn't kill 
   them, that is) and anonymously turning them over to the police. The 
   Captain is pissed-off and wants the vigilante off the streets, but it 
   becomes apparent to the viewer after a short period of time that Mark 
   is actually the ninja (especially after Mark talks an armed suspect 
   into giving up his weapon and later that night the ninja delivers 
   money to the suspect's sick wife and hungry children). Mark is a cop 
   by day and a ninja at night, using his ninja skills to right wrongs 
   that a crooked legal system can't solve. When Mark discovers that old 
   family friend Frank is smuggling heroin in religious statues (When 
   Mark confronts him about it, Frank shoots himself in the head!), he 
   sets out to free Frank's son Antonio, who is being held captive by 
   the people who were forcing Frank to smuggle smack. Mark saves 
   Antonio and then begins dismantling the drug business by using his 
   ninja skills, which will lead him all the way to the top of the drug 
   trade. The drug kingpin just happens to be Maraccio, which will give 
   Mark the chance to get revenge on the one person who murdered his 
   parents, as well as cleaning-up the town's heroin supply.&nbsp; This 
   Filipino action film, directed by John Lloyd (<B><A HREF="#NinjaWarriors">NINJA
    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1985; <B><A HREF="trigon_fire_1989.htm">TRIGON FIRE</A></B>

   has a role here as a pimp named Sly), is nothing but a series of 
   action film and TV series clich&eacute;s, including the obligatory 
   police station Mexican standoff, where a bad guy in police custody 
   grabs a cop's gun and holds the entire station hostage until Mark 
   talks him down, but it's an enjoyable collection of clich&eacute;s 
   nonetheless. The funniest scene comes when Maraccio captures Mark and 
   slowly hooks him on heroin (shades of <B><A HREF="french_connection_2_1975.htm">FRENCH
    CONNECTION II</A></B> - 1975). Instead of killing him, Maraccio 
   drops him off in an alley, where a bunch of bums steal his clothes 
   and Jackson miraculously find him seconds later and detoxes Mark in 
   an amazingly short period of time. Romano Kristoff is his normal 
   stoic self, hardly showing any emotions at all (I half-expected that 
   any flesh wounds he incurred would reveal a metal skeleton and a 
   bunch of wires, but I was wrong) and Ken Watanabe (who was Kristoff's 
   adversary in the original <B>NINJA'S FORCE</B>) shows up in flashback 
   scenes as Mark's ninja teacher and adoptive father. If you like films 
   with plenty of gunfire, fighting and a smattering of gore (throat 
   slashings, impalements and ninja stars to the forehead), <B>NINJA'S 
   FORCE II</B> (also known as <B><A HREF="double_edge_1986.htm">DOUBLE EDGE</A></B>)
    should be right up your alley. Just mind your shoes and clothes.

   - 1987), a group of gasmask-wearing black-clad ninjas stealthily 
   break into a well-guarded highrise building and steal a folder marked 
   &quot;Classified: Top Secret&quot;. After taking the file, the ninjas 
   then kill all the guards as they exit the building (Why they didn't 
   just kill them on their way in is never explained). An exasperated 
   Captain Henry Marlowe (Mike Monty) assigns Lt. Kevin Washington (Paul 
   Vance) to the case. Kevin thinks ninjas are involved, so he goes to 
   his friend, master martial artist (and white ninja) Steve (Ron 
   Marchini) for some help. From the outset of their first meeting, 
   Steve and Kevin are constantly attacked by the black ninjas (Who 
   still wear their gas masks. Maybe they just eat a lot of Mexican 
   food.). It then comes to our attention that the stolen top secret 
   folder contained a formula for mind control, but when crime kingpin 
   Kuroda (Ken Wantanabe, who also receives story credit) is informed 
   that some of the pages of the formula are missing, he has his black 
   ninjas kidnap the daughter of the scientist who wrote the formula. 
   Unfortunately, they grab an undercover policewoman instead and

   and the bumbling Kevin capture Tom (Romano Kristoff), one of the 
   black ninjas, but he won't talk (Steve says, &quot;Forget it Kevin, 
   he's a ninja!&quot;). A note is delivered to Captain Marlowe's office 
   that offers to trade the undercover policewoman for Tom. At the 
   exchange, the policewoman is killed and Tom gets away. Kuroda has his 
   ninjas kidnap the real scientist's daughter (a female ninja carries a 
   tennis racket with a knife hidden in the handle) and they find a key 
   around her neck (It's so big, I'm surprised the poor girl didn't have 
   back trouble!) which leads them to a safety deposit box that contains 
   the formula's missing pages. Kuroda makes Tom commit hari-kari for 
   getting caught as Steve and Kevin get closer to Kuroda and stopping 
   the mind control experiments from being completed. When Captain 
   Marlowe is brutally murdered by Kuroda (he shoves a sword through the 
   back of Marlowe's head until the blade protrudes out his mouth!) and 
   Kevin is taken prisoner and tortured (and, eventually, killed), Steve

   the martial arts fights are clumsily-staged, director John Lloyd (<B><A HREF="#NinjasForce2">NINJA'S

   keep you entertained. First off, it's a miracle that the stupid and 
   awkward Kevin even graduated kindergarten, much less the police 
   academy. He's an oaf of the first degree, as he constantly puts Steve 
   and other cops lives in jeopardy with his rash decisions and stupid 
   choices. If I were Steve, I would have said &quot;Thank God!&quot;

   a rescue mission to a gook POW camp containing American prisoners, 
   one of them being a CIA agent. Baylor wants Sanders and Cotter to 
   either save or kill his agent (he doesn't give a shit about the other

   will use the info the agent has to further the cause of Communism.

   Cotter get away. Sanders hooks up with a foul-mouthed female CIA

   Cotter to Central America. Cotter kills everyone in a church during 
   Mass and Sanders learns that Ivan plans to use Cotter to kill the 
   Pope (the freakin' Pope!) when he visits San Salvador in three days.

   Mafia gang have a shootout with the Marauders, one of the Mafia goons

   Another crazy Filippino action flick that grabs you from the

   the diary was destroyed in the plane explosion, the goons don't 
   believe him and make him watch as they kill Ann by running her 
   through with a sword. They then cut off Ortega's left arm with the 
   same sword (he was left-handed) and leave him bleeding but alive. 
   When Ortega wakes up in the hospital and sees his missing appendage, 
   he vows revenge on all those responsible (His boss at Interpol, on 
   hearing Ortega's vow, insensitively says, &quot;Listen, fathead, and 
   listen straight. Hands off!&quot; Ouch, what a dickhead!). Ortega at 
   first feels sorry for himself, gets drunk and talks to his dead wife 
   (surprisingly, she talks back!). He soon comes around, thanks to a 
   friendly Chinese sensai, and begins training, learning how to handle 
   a gun with his right hand and also how to fight with one arm and both 
   feet. After his training is through, he systematically kills all 
   those responsible for Ann's death, eventually leading to a final 
   showdown with Edwards and his leading henchman Jason (Pete Cooper) at 
   his drug hideout. Expect lots of bullets and things that blow up real 
   nice.&nbsp; Director Bobby A. Suarez doesn't give you enough time to 
   realize the ridiculousness of the story, thanks to the frequent 
   violence and other crazy situations (including Ortega's

   interesting aspect of Ray Hamilton's script has one of Edwards' 
   associates, Milo, be a walking thesaurus, offering Edwards better 
   words for his conversations and written communications, thereby 
   making Edwards seem more sophisticated than he actually is. You won't 
   see stuff like that in American action films. If I really have one 
   complaint, it's that the fullscreen transfer is framed dead-center. 
   Since much of the action takes place on the right and left sides of 
   the screen, a widescreen transfer would have been preferrable, or at 
   least pan-and-scan, because Paragon Video's transfer shows a lot of

    MAN ARMY</A><A NAME="OneManArmy"></A> (1993) -</B> When interest in 
   his post-nuke and Vietnam War actioners began to wane in the early 
   90's, director/producer Cirio H. Santiago switched to making 
   modern-day martial arts flicks. Unfortunately, these films are 
   Santiago's most anemic, thanks to ever-shrinking budgets and a severe 
   lack of star power, especially in his choice of leading actors. This 
   is one of the worst of the bunch. Martial arts teacher Jerry Pelt 
   (Jerry Trimble) is called back to his hometown to attend the funeral 
   of his judge grandfather. As soon as he enters his birthplace, he 
   notices that the town has changed (for one, it's now full of Filipino 
   extras) and it's not for the better. Jerry hooks-up with old 
   girlfriend Natalie Pierce (Melissa Moore; Santiago's <B><A HREF="action.htm#AngelFist">ANGELFIST</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> </FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">-
    1992), who informs him that the town has been taken over by a man 
   named Sidney Sharperson (Paul Holmes), who has ties to organized 
   crime and smuggles illegal aliens into the country to work for slave 
   wages in his fields. Jerry finds evidence that his grandfather may 
   have been murdered for discovering the illegal alien smuggling 
   operation, so he sets out to find definite proof. It doesn't help 
   that the corrupt sheriff, Pat Boze (the late Rick Dean; Santiago's <B><A HREF="action.htm#RaidersOfTheSun">RAIDERS
    OF THE SUN</A></B> - 1991), is a childhood enemy of Jerry's, who 
   dogs his every move. When Natalie, who is a lawyer, suggests that 
   Jerry runs for sherif<A HREF="one_man_army_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/one man army vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>f,
    he initially rejects the idea, but after a series of deadly 
   &quot;accidents&quot; in town, Jerry decides that running for sheriff 
   is probably just what this county needs. Natalie is shot and wounded 
   by a couple of motorcycle helmet-wearing thugs while taking a topless 
   dip in a lake with Jerry (who are now lovers again), so Jerry, along 
   with his grandfather's intelligent German Shepherd &quot;Hank&quot; 
   (played by &quot;Yup&quot;, who shows a wider range of emotions than 
   the leading man), begin to tear the town apart looking for the 
   shooters as well as picking up support from the townspeople who are 
   sick and tired of all the corruption. When Sharperson tries to bribe 
   Jerry, Natalie secretly records the conversation and has a radio DJ 
   (Henry Strzalkowski) broadcast it. Thanks to the recording, Jerry 
   easily wins the election and, with childhood pal Eddie Taylor (Dennis 
   Hayden), begins cleaning up the town. Eddie, it turns out, is not 
   such a good friend after all, as he's a coke addict and is on Boze's 
   payroll. Eddie kills his wife Pilar (Yvonne Michelle) in a coked-out 
   haze, knocks-out Jerry and sets the house on fire. Thinking Jerry is 
   dead (He's not. Hank drags him out of the burning house.), Eddie 
   takes over as sheriff and brings Boze and the other corrupt cops back 
   on the payroll. When Jerry finds out that it was Eddie who killed his 
   grandfather, he goes on a one-man murder spree, killing everyone 
   (including Boze, who shoots Sharperson in the back for slapping him 
   in the face one too many times) until only he and Eddie (who has 
   kidnapped Natalie) are left.&nbsp; The first thing you'll notice 
   about this film is how one-note champion kickboxer Jerry Trimble is 
   as an actor (Trimble has the fastest kick ever recorded, clocked at 
   118 mph). Trimble is simply terrible and has the emotional range of a 
   rock, which makes me wonder why director Santiago used him as the 
   star of two other films, 1992's <B><A HREF="action.htm#LiveByTheFist">LIVE
    BY THE FIST</A></B> and 1994's <B><A HREF="action.htm#Stranglehold1994">STRANGLEHOLD</A></B>.
    The second thing you'll notice about the film is how many times 
   Trimble gets hit in the face every time he gets into a fight. For 
   someone so proficient in the martial arts, he certainly takes more 
   than his fair share of the punishment. I'm still trying to figure out 
   if that's a good or bad thing. Santiago tries to keep our minds off 
   the film's gaping plot holes by tossing as much female nudity at us 
   as possible (Melissa Moore has several nude scenes, as do most of the 
   women here), but the sad fact is that Trimble (who is married to 
   actress Ami Dolenz [<B><A HREF="ticks_1993.htm">TICKS</A></B> - 1993; <B><A HREF="pumpkinhead_2_blood_wings_1994.htm">PUMPKINHEAD
    II: BLOOD WINGS</A></B> - 1994]) is not able to hold up his end as 
   an actor and the normally wild Rick Dean (Santiago's <B><A HREF="#NamAngels">NAM
    ANGELS</A></B> - 1988; <B><A HREF="naked_obsession_1990.htm">NAKED OBSESSION</A></B> 
   - 1990) is much too subdued here. The only humor comes when Jerry and 
   Eddie go to break-up an illegal martial arts tournament in one of 
   Sharperson's bars, only to find a bingo tournament instead, thanks to 
   the traitorous Eddie tipping-off Sharperson in advance. The fight 
   scenes are fairly lively and somewhat bloody but, all-in-all, this 
   action flick is average at best, thanks to Trimble's non-existant 
   thespian talents. As with most of Santiago's films, this was financed 
   by Roger Corman and clocks in at a scant 79 minutes. Originally known 
   as <B>KICK &amp; FURY</B>. Also starring James Paolleli, Peter 
   Shilton, Joseph Zucchero, Nick Nicholson, Ramon D'Salva and Bill

   group of ninja-like assassins enter the well-guarded home of an 
   important man (a framed photo shows him as Newsweek's Man Of The 
   Year. Wait a minute; isn't that Time Magazine's job?), killing 
   everyone inside except their target, who saw them coming and escapes. 
   The assassins' faceless, cane-carrying boss is pissed-off and orders 
   his black clad goons to find him. The film then switches to an Eagle 
   Scout camp in the woods, where Scout Greg (Casey Hirsch) is about to 
   spend three days alone in the mountains to earn a merit badge. Greg 
   begins his lonely trek, only to fall over a small cliff and land next 
   to the wreckage of a single-engine plane that must have crashed there 
   years earlier, judging by the condition of the pilot's corpse. Greg 
   searches the plane and finds a briefcase containing some

   evil businessman Mr. Quill (Frank Stallone; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Death Feud">DEATH

    two years. The disks he had in the briefcase are plans for some Star 
   Wars Missile Defense Strategy (ah, the 80's!) and Mr. Quill will do 
   anything to get his hands on those disks, including murder. Quill has 
   his security expert Leo (David Roger Harris) hire five hitmen to go 
   into the woods and retrieve the disks. To show how nasty these five 
   hitmen are, we watch in flashbacks as they perform some previous 
   hits. One shoots a U.S. senator with an arrow; another shoots three 
   survivalists point-blank; another blows-up a restrained man in a car 
   with a grenade; another pushes a woman out of a helicopter; and the 
   last one, a crooked cop, shoots a dealer and steals his drugs. Back 
   to the present, the five hitmen converge in the woods looking for 
   Greg and the disks, but Greg gets some unexpected help from local 
   yokels John Billings (William Zipp; <B><A HREF="mankillers_1987.htm">MANKILLERS</A></B> 
   - 1987), Freddie (Perry Hill) and pretty local store owner Monica 
   (Jil Foor). The hitmen take Greg prisoner, but he refuses to tell 
   them where he has hidden the disks. Monica alerts John and Ranger 
   Mike (Mike Hickam; who died during production) of the hitmen's 
   presence when they stop by her store looking for directions (She 
   notices a .45 pistol in one of the men's belts and immediately grows 
   suspicious, because, c'mon, who goes hunting with a pistol?). When 
   Ranger Mike is shot dead, Greg escapes with John's help. Quinn sends 
   professional killer Jack LaRouse (David Marriott), the mysterious man 
   with the cane from the beginning of the film, and a nameless tracker 
   (Ner Reodica) to finish the job that the hitmen failed to do, but 
   John, Freddie and Monica help Greg retrieve the briefcase and defeat 
   Quinn and his cadre of killers. Greg the Boy Scout may not have been 
   prepared as he would have liked to be, but he was damned lucky to 
   have made these new friends that know a thing or two about forest 
   warfare.&nbsp; This low-budget Action International Pictures in-house

   Zipp, may be a common &quot;chase through the woods&quot; actioner, 
   but at least it's a bloody one, with plenty of bloody bullet squibs, 
   stabbings, impalements and explosions. Though no one here is going to 
   win any acting awards and some of the plot developments scream of 
   desperation (especially the amazing coincidence of John being a 
   Special Ops Vietnam War veteran, even though he looks way too young 
   to have fought in that war), the film does move at a quick pace and 
   you just gotta love when one of the hitmen tells Greg that he got 
   kicked-out of the Boy Scouts for &quot;eating Brownies&quot; (an old 
   joke for sure and one that leads me to believe that this film wasn't 
   sanctioned by the Scouts, even though their emblem and badges are 
   prominently displayed). Another amusing quick bit is where Greg 
   mentions Rambo to John and John replies, &quot;Who?&quot; Nothing 
   special, but not bad for what it is. The music soundtrack sounds like 
   it was lifted from a cheap 50's horror film. Also starring Brian

    VIOLATORS</A><A NAME="Parole Violators"></A> (1994) -</B> Strap 
   yourself to your seats, folks. You're in for a bumpy ride. Miles Long 
   (Sean Donahue), is the host of the TV show &quot;Parole 
   Violator&quot;, where he shows audience-submitted videos of people on 
   parole committing crimes. He is also a disgraced ex-cop who 
   videotapes parolees breaking the law and catches them for the police. 
   The cops call him the &quot;Video Cop&quot; because he leaves the 
   crooks tied up with a VHS tape of their crime taped to their body. 
   Miles newest prey is Chino Lopez (Rey Garcia), a child 
   pedophile/murderer he put away six years earlier when he was a cop. 
   The parole board determines that Chino is rehabilitated, but Miles 
   knows better. Sure enough, Chino and his right-hand man Toos (Michael 
   Kiel) kidnap a young girl in the park and Miles gives chase on his 
   motorcycle, forcing Chino and Toos to toss the girl out of their 
   moving car. In retribution, Chino kidnaps the daughter of Miles' cop 
   girlfriend Tracy (Pamela Bosley). Chino and his goons then beat up 
   and kidnap Miles and Tracy in a bar, but Miles breaks free in transit 
   (leading to one of the most ludicrous fights in a moving van you will 
   never see), disarms two goons and proceeds to crash the van. Toos 
   grabs Tracy out of the van and he and Chino take <A HREF="parole_violators_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/parole violators poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>her
    to a barn, where Toos tries to rape her. Miles arrives in the nick 
   of time (Toos: &quot;Where'd you come from? Miles: &quot;Through the 
   window!&quot;) and beats the snot out of Toos (he even slightly 
   impales him in the stomach with a broken piece of lumber), but Chino 
   gets away with Tracy's daughter. A short time later, Chino has 
   Tracy's daughter tied-up on a raft in the middle of a pool. When 
   Miles and Tracy arrive, Chino tells Miles that he has to fight his 
   gang to win the girl's life and for every 30 seconds of the fight, he 
   will poke a hole in the raft (this Chicano means business!). Miles 
   wins the fight, but not before Chino pokes dozens of holes in the 
   raft (he's not a man of his word), leading to Tracy's daughter being 
   in a coma from being underwater for too long. Chino then hires a 
   bunch of skinheads (with names like &quot;Knuckles&quot; and 
   &quot;Goon&quot;) to kill Miles and Tracy. They kidnap Tracy and 
   Inspector Davis (Leeds Landain), an Internal Affairs officer 
   investigating Tracy's recent behavior, but Miles saves the day 
   (again) and they all end up at a warehouse, where the final battle is 
   fought. No one comes out unscathed, but it all ends on a happy 
   note.&nbsp; This is definitely a film that needs to be seen to be 
   disbelieved. Horribly acted by everyone (although Pamela Bosley 
   easily wins hands-down for impersonating an actor) and clumsily 
   directed and co-scripted by Patrick G. Donahue (<B><A HREF="kill_squad_1981.htm">KILL
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1981; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Savage Instinct">SAVAGE INSTINCT</A></B> 
   - 1989), this film is just one non-stop unbelievably bad fight scene 
   or stunt after another and, therefore, must be seen by everyone. 
   Patrick's son Sean Donahue (who was also co-scripter and stunt 
   co-ordinator) gets hit with so many cars and falls down so many 
   times, I'm surprised he not retarded or eating his meals through a 
   straw. His many martial arts fights (there are too many to count) are 
   awkward, but not totally without merit, as people have their noses 
   broken, eyes gouged out, impaled, shot numerous times or blown up, 
   all of it extremely bloody. While there are plenty of stunts (cars 
   flip and explode, a motorcycle flys off a cliff, people fall off 
   buildings and crash through windows) and multiple fights to keep your 
   eyes occupied, the screenplay will have you laughing till you puke 
   with lines like, &quot;I'll kill you, you son of a bastard!&quot; The 
   scene towards the end where Tracy tries to seduce skinhead Goon (Joe 
   Edwards) and the camera pans down to show her bad case of cameltoe, 
   almost made me spit up my soda! There's also a scene where Miles goes 
   through a window and he gets up and spits glass shards out of his 
   mouth. The finale alone is worth the price of a purchase as Miles, 
   Tracy and Inspector Davis, all shot repeatedly, get their revenge on 
   Chino and Toos. There's also jokes about Miles Long's name (&quot;What
    kind of parents would give their kid a name like that?&quot;), car 
   windshields that break way too easily and a very funny scene where 
   Miles is tossed back and forth on top of a car. This is not a good 
   film by any stretch of the imagination but, damn, it is entertaining!

   once lovers who served in the same unit, but they lost touch when 
   Matt was dishonorably discharged for slugging a superior officer (he

   and disarm the active warhead before it is too late? If you are 
   wondering what happened to Howard, don't worry. He is left to fly the

   this role just because he gets to frolic with a scantily-clad woman

    RAIDERS</A><A NAME="PhantomRaiders"></A> (1988) -</B> In this 
   mindless Filipino actioner, the evil Colonel Marshall (Mike Monty) 
   and his squad of terrorists capture a small platoon of American 
   soldiers on a recon mission in modern-day Vietnam. The Colonel has 
   his men kill all but one of the Americans when he pits them against 
   his best fighters in a twisted boobytrapped arena, where the loser 
   not only gets killed by impalements on spikes, but another tied-up 
   soldier is machine-gunned to death when the winner trips a triggering 
   device. The Colonel kills the last American himself, by setting him 
   free and hunting him down in the jungle. An undercover photographer 
   takes pictures of Colonel Marshall's terrorist training facility and 
   passes the photos to a female operative just before the Colonel 
   captures him and has him killed. The photos make their way to the 
   CIA, where an official hires Python Lang (Miles O'Keeffe) to put 
   together a team and either bring Colonel Marshall back alive or kill 
   him if he's truly a traitor. Python hires three of his former Nam 
   buddies (who are now selling heroin in the private sector!) after 
   promising them $250,000 each when they complete the mission (One of 
   them says to Python when he finds out they are selling skag, <A HREF="phantom_raiders_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/phantom raiders dvd small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>&quot;We
    need money to feed our families, not medals.&quot;). After Python 
   and Howard (Colonel Marshall's son, who is also going on the mission) 
   put the trio through comprehensive &quot;special training&quot; (a 
   boobytrapped-filled jungle obstacle course mixed with martial arts 
   training), the quintet travel to Vietnam to begin their mission. They 
   begin to slowly make their way to the Colonel's headquarters and meet 
   resistance at nearly every turn. It almost seems like someone 
   tipped-off the Colonel that Python and his team were after him. Is it 
   possible Python has a traitor in his ranks? When they finally get to 
   the Colonel's training facility, Howard hopes for a touching reunion 
   with Dad, but learns that his father is nothing but a cold-hearted 
   bastard (His father says to him, &quot;You may be a soldier, but 
   you've got no guts!&quot; when Howard hesitates and Dad gets the drop 
   on him). Python ends up killing the Colonel and only he and Howard 
   make it out alive. The other three members are killed, probably 
   because they were heroin dealers back in the States. Really, did we 
   expect them to live?&nbsp; While lacking any type of cohesive plot 
   (We know that Colonel Marshall is a bad guy from the opening scene, 
   so bringing him back alive isn't really an option, is it?) and the 
   believability factor is thrown out the window the moment Howard is 
   allowed to participate in the mission (Even I know that you don't 
   send a relative, much less a son, on a mission such as this), this 
   film should please Filipino action fans because it is nothing but a 
   series of shoot-outs, explosions, spiked boobytraps and stealthy 
   ninja-like action (including death by throwing stars, bolo and good, 
   old-fashioned neck-snapping). Director Sonny Sanders (His only 
   directorial effort. He also co-wrote the screenplay to Jun Gallardo's <B><A HREF="firing_line_1991.htm">THE
    FIRING LINE</A></B> [1991]), who also co-scripted this with Timothy 
   Jorge (scripter of Jun Gallardo's <B><A HREF="action.htm#SFXRetaliator">SFX
    RETALIATOR</A></B> [1987]), supplies a non-stop series of action 
   set-pieces, where people are shot (lots of bloody squibs), stabbed, 
   impaled, blown-up or otherwise dispatched by other means. Buildings, 
   vehicles and other objects also blow up at regular intervals. If you 
   want a story, forget it, because <B><A HREF="phantom_raiders_1988b.htm">P</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="phantom_raiders_1988b.htm">HANTOM

   is not that type of film (The whole film has about five minutes worth

   mask and I'm willing to bet that most of the time it's a stand-in or

   (names like &quot;Jim Hope&quot;, &quot;Dick Curtis&quot;, &quot;Gary

    is a bagman for the CIA and that their mission smells a little fishy 
   (Sturges may be a drug smuggler, but kidnapping a woman is out of 
   character), the trio, along with a female guide named Pao (Miki Kim), 
   begins their trek down river into Laos to free Mrs. Karlson (Colleen 
   Casey). Along the way, Pao picks up an infant and everyone encounters 
   enemy soldiers. They stop at a village, only to find that nearly all 
   the villagers, including women and children, were viciously 
   gunned-down in the center of town. Pao gives the baby to a young 
   mother who just witnessed her baby being killed by heartless drug 
   smugglers (It's a reasonable solution to a sticky situation). Frank 
   is captured by the drug smugglers, tied to a cross and is tortured by 
   being submerged in a lake while hanging upside down. Cromwell, Joe 
   and Pao rush in and save Frank's ass, killing all the drug smugglers 
   in a hail of automatic gunfire. They make it to Sturges' jungle 
   compound, but it looks as if Pao (after just making love to Cromwell) 
   has turned traitor and joined Sturges' side. To make matters worse, 
   Sturges and Mrs. Karlson are actually lovers (the kidnapping was all 
   a set-up to extort money from her husband), but our trio do manage to 
   snatch her back and intend to complete their mission. Joe is 
   seriously wounded during the &quot;rescue&quot; and dies, leaving 
   Cromwell, Frank and Mrs. Karlson to hoof it by foot to their pick-up 
   point. The finale finds Cromwell and Frank taking the side of Sturges 
   and Mrs. Karlson when it is revealed that Phil Karlson is actually 
   the drug smuggler and Sturges is only trying to help the locals, with 
   the help of his lover, Mrs. Karlson. It's a crazy world we live in, 
   isn't it?&nbsp; This minor actioner, directed and written by Clark 
   Henderson (<B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#WarlordsFromHell">WARLORDS

   (The plight of the poor locals, who have to deal with the drug 
   smugglers, who use them as slave labor, as well as the brutal 
   government who couldn't give a rat's ass about their well-being. 
   Boo-frickin'-hoo!), but the film comes across rather flat and 
   pedantic. Though some of the action scenes are very bloody (people 
   are shot in the head; women and children are killed on-camera), this 
   Philippines-lensed film seems overly familiar and stale. Even the 
   twist ending is telegraphed early on and the death scenes have an 
   over-reliance on using slow-motion (Henderson is no Peckinpah, that's 
   for sure!). The only plus here is the easy chemistry between John 
   Calvin (who would appear in the far-superior <B><A HREF="#SiegeFirebaseGloria">SIEGE
    OF FIREBASE GLORIA</A></B> the next year), Joey Aresco and Henry 
   Strzalkowski (a regular in the films of director Cirio H. Santiago). 
   They seem quite comfortable in each other's company and their 
   dialogue seems natural and unforced. That's little compensation for 
   what amounts to be a miniscule footnote in Filipino action film 
   history, though. A small ripple in an ocean of killer waves. Also

   notch-up the violence to revenge mode. You'll witness motorcycle 
   chases, gunfights, fistfights and other mayhem before everything is 
   settled in the unexpected finale (with a surprise villian). The 
   action is particularly graphic for an action film as the bullet hits

   (there's a nasty cigarette-in-the-ear gag that made me wince). While

    OF THE PARADISE</A><A NAME="RaidersOfTheParadis"></A> (1985) -</B> 
   The islands that form Palawan in the Philippines have found much 
   prosperity thanks to the discovery of oil in the surrounding ocean 
   bed and it has made some of the locals very rich people. This 
   prosperity has not gone unnoticed by some of the less fortunate 
   locals, some who raid a Hawaiian-style party thrown by a rich local 
   bigwig for his affluent friends. The raiders kidnap all the young 
   daughters at the party (when one young girl tries to escape, they 
   shoot her in the back several times) and bring them to their hidden 
   camp on one of Palawan's many small islands. Since the raiders used 
   rubber rafts to make their escape, the military concludes that they 
   couldn't have traveled further than 30 kilometers, so they send out 
   commando units to search all the islands within that radius. One 
   commando unit finds the island where the girls are being held, but 
   the kidnappers manage to avoid detection (the girls are being held in 
   a hidden room on the island's lighthouse). The kidnappers demand a 
   ransom of 50 million pesos from Mr. Hercules Perlas (Chito Ponce 
   Enrile), the rich father of Melissa (Josephine Estrada), one of the 
   kidnapped girls, and he must deliver it within 72 hours or the girls 
   will be <A HREF="raiders_of_the_paradise_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/raiders of the paradise vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>killed.
    Despite objections from the General (Eddie Garcia), who says, 
   &quot;You'll be draining the commercial banks of their cash 
   flow!&quot;, Mr. Perlas tries to get the money together and wait for 
   further instructions. Unfortunately, scraping 50 million pesos 
   together is not as easy as Mr. Perlas thought it would be, so he begs 
   the kidnappers for more time. The kidnappers, who take their orders 
   from some unseen man called &quot;The Boss&quot;, nearly shoots all 
   the girls firing squad style, but they get a reprieve when The Boss 
   agrees to a three-day extension. Melissa, the strongest and most 
   level-headed member of the female hostages, puts together an escape 
   plan that involves digging a tunnel, but one of the girls turns 
   traitorous and makes a deal with The Boss, which leads to another 
   female hostage getting raped. The military have finally figured out 
   where the girls are (based on photos the kidnappers sent Mr. Perlas) 
   and devise a plan to rescue them with a &quot;bladed&quot; attack, 
   using edged weapons instead of guns to silently kill the kidnappers. 
   Melissa and the other girls escape through the tunnel under cover of 
   darkness, only to find the kidnappers waiting for them on the other 
   side, which results in one girl being shot dead and Melissa getting 
   the shit kicked out of her. The girls must now depend on the 
   commandos, who are given 90 minutes to sneak onto the island and 
   dispose of all the kidnappers (Why they are only given 90 minutes is 
   never really made clear). The rescue attempt turns out to be a long 
   and bloody one, where not everyone survives. The finale reveals that 
   The Boss is actually Mr. Perlas' assistant Bernie (Roel Vergel De 
   Dios), who was upset that Mr. Perlas was going to turn the business 
   over to Melissa and leave him without a job. Don't worry, folks. 
   Bernie meets a fitting demise.&nbsp; This Filipino hostage drama, 
   directed by Romy Suzara (<B><A HREF="gunfighter_1983.htm">THE GUNFIGHTER</A></B> 
   - 1983) and written by Avelino Zapanta, is a little slow-moving, but 
   does contain some tense scenes, including the nerve-jangling firing 
   squad sequence. While the violence is somewhat tame throughout most 
   of the film (just a couple of shootings and an off-screen rape), the 
   final rescue, which involves scuba divers, who sneak onto the island 
   and kill the kidnappers as silently as possible, is the film's bloody 
   highlight. Kidnappers are sliced and diced with knives until the 
   rescue attempt is exposed, where it then turns into a bloody 
   gunfight, as Melissa's Uncle Chuck (Vic Vargas) and the other 
   commandos try to get the girls safely off the island. It doesn't end 
   too well for everyone, as one girl sacrifices herself by falling on a 
   grenade (a bloody effect that leaves nothing to the imagination), 
   Uncle Chuck is shot and killed and Melissa pumps the raping kidnapper 
   full of lead. When Mr. Perlas makes the ransom drop in the finale, 
   only to discover that Bernie is the mastermind, it turns into a 
   non-stop bulletfest, with bad guys getting shot in the head, a team 
   of cross-dressing commandos (!) lending a hand and Bernie running 
   into the spinning blades of an airplane. What more could you possibly 
   ask for? This one is tough to find, so if you ever find a copy, grab

   Mustapha is so impressed with Williams and his weapon, he hires him 
   to kidnap a U.S. four-star General for reasons not made clear. 
   Thompson (who drives around in a pickup truck with the words <A HREF="rapid_fire_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/rapid fire vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>&quot;Rolling
    Thunder&quot; emblazoned on the front windshield, just so he stands 
   out!) makes contact with old Williams nemesis Pappy (Douglas Harter), 
   who gives Thompson the first clue where to find Williams: An ice 
   cream bar named Bananas that is staffed with hookers with names like 
   &quot;Pistachio&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Swirl&quot;. Thompson gets 
   into a dust-up with the male bouncers (he pokes one guy's eye out 
   with a pencil) and gets the next clue to Williams' location. Thompson 
   teams up with female operative Corle Parker (Dawn Tanner, who is a 
   terrible actress), who lost her last partner by Mustapha's hands. Of 
   course, Thompson and Corle fall in love in the process. Williams and 
   his gang (including the guy who had his eye removed with the pencil, 
   who now sports a black pirate patch!) try to kill Pappy, but he whips 
   out a hand grenade and pulls the pin, forcing Williams to back off 
   (the grenade turns out to be nothing but a cigarette lighter). 
   Williams kidnaps Corle and uses her as bait (he also abandons the 
   plot to kidnap the General) to kill Thompson. Hansen tries to 
   interfere, but Thompson and Pappy eventually rescue Corle and then 
   turn their attention to Williams, while Corle goes after Mustapha. 
   Williams grabs his prototype weapon and battles Thompson and Pappy. 
   Corle kills Mustapha and Thompson gives Williams a beat-down, who is 
   then killed by his own weapon.&nbsp; It should come as no surprise 
   that this completely awful actioner was directed/co-scripted by David 
   A. Prior, who also unleased the equally terrible films <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Sledgehammer">SLEDGEHAMMER</A></B> 
   (1984), <B><A HREF="#DeathChase">DEATH CHASE</A></B> (1987), <B><A HREF="#Night Wars">NIGHT
    WARS</A></B> (1988), <B><A HREF="action.htm#WhiteFury">WHITE FURY</A></B> 
   (1990) and many others upon unsuspecting home video viewers. If 
   you've seen any of Prior's previous action films, you know what to 
   expect here: Badly-staged action scenes, plenty of bloody bullet 
   squibs and acting that can best be described as anemic. It's 
   particularly distressing watching Joe Spinell (this film opens and 
   closes with a dedication to him) in this, his last film. He looks 
   visually ill and emaciated (he died of a heart attack, brought on by 
   years of alcoholism and drug abuse, before this film was released) 
   and it looks painful for him just to talk (The script, co-written by 
   frequent Prior star William Zipp, gives Spinell a line that excuses 
   the way he talks by saying he recently had dental surgery!). This is 
   no way to end such an illustrious career and I was sorry to see 
   Spinell (who had a fantastic career in A-list and B-list films, 
   although he is best remembered for his rare starring role in William 
   Lustig's <B><A HREF="maniac_1980.htm">MANIAC</A></B> [1980]) 
   appearing in crap like this. And <B><A HREF="rapid_fire_1989c.htm">RAPID
    FIRE</A></B> is crap of the worst kind, padded out with flashbacks, 
   nightmares (where Williams battles himself because he fears Thompson 
   is the better fighter, which really negates his villian status) and a 
   finale where Pappy wrestles a bear in a bar (!) for no other reason 
   than to increase the running time (it clocks in at 85 minutes, but it 
   is a looooong 85 minutes). Not recommended to anyone, especially Joe 
   Spinell fans. Filmed in Mobile, Alabama. Also starring Gary Olsen,

   too much good press and purchased the DVD. After viewing it, I must 
   say that I was not as impressed as the people who got me to watch it. 
   It's badly acted, terribly underlit and, let's face it, it's shot on 
   video. What it does have in its favor is a visceral energy that just 
   won't quit. It's full of bloody shootouts, stabbings, fist fights, 
   throat slashings, eyeball gougings and other gory mayhem. The plot is 
   simple: Widower Gregory Burroughs (a miscast Mark Brazeale) comes 
   home from a date with a co-worker Lydia (Dina Harris) to find serial 
   killer Charles (Dan Rowland) slaughtering his two daughters. Charles 
   escapes, leaving Gregory stabbed in the back and several policemen 
   dead. Gregory makes it his life's work to track down Charles and end 
   his miserable life. What Gregory doesn't realize is that Charles is 
   also tracking him. When Gregory sees a news report on TV about a 
   murder/robbery in Chicago and recognizes the robber as Charles, he 
   leaves his Missouri town and hightails it to Chicago. Complications 
   arise when Lydia finds out the guy in Chicago is actually Charles' 
   twin brother Samuel, a bloodthirsty leader of a gang of ruthless 
   killers. Charles and Samuel do not know each other exists. When Lydia 
   travels to Chicago to be with Gregory, Charles follows her, which 
   leads to an unexpected (and very bloody) meeting of the brothers, 
   which in turn leads to one of the bloodiest set-pieces in low budget 
   history. It's obvious that director Ronnie Sortor (<B><A HREF="sinyster_1994.htm">SIN</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="sinyster_1994.htm">I</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="sinyster_1994.htm">ST</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="sinyster_1994.htm">RE</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   - 1994) is working with an extremely small budget (Sortor has said 
   that he made this film for under $5,000.00!). The actors generally 
   never rise above amateur status, although Dan Rowland could give 
   anyone the creeps with a simple stare and producer Frank Alexander 
   scores in his role as a Chicago detective. The real stars of <B><A HREF="ravage_1997a.htm">RAVAGE</A></B> 
   are the frequent shootouts and stabbings. People are shot and stabbed 
   in the head, chest and every conceivable body part. The best scene is 
   the shootout in the police station, where one disciple of Samuel 
   blows away about 20 cops before finally being taken down with about 
   100 bullets. There's some really awful sound effects that cheapen the 
   fight scenes but, overall, this is not a bad way to spend 85 minutes. 
   Some major film company should give Mr. Sortor a decent budget so he 
   can remake this film with professional actors and crew. It's 
   guaranteed to be a hit. Until then, this will have to do. A <A HREF="http://www.b-movie.com">Sub

   at the home of Mr. Bellows' daughter-in-law, Jenny (Linda Blair; <B><A HREF="hell_night_1981.htm">HELL
    NIGHT</A></B> - 1981), the wife of Mr. Bellows' missing son, who has 
   a young son of her own, Bobby (Bobby Hughes). Kyle is a man of few 
   words, but he tells Jenny that he has never met her husband. Jenny 
   cooks him a hot meal, but it's not long before Mr. Bellows, Sarge and 
   an even larger posse shows up to hunt him down. Kyle steals a dirt 
   bike and hides in the forest, where he fashions a homemade 
   bow-and-arrow and shoots Homer (Clifford Pellow) in the ass. Sheriff 
   Pough sends Mr. Bellows and the posse home, as he has just obtained 
   Kyle's military service records, where it is revealed that Kyle was 
   in the Special Forces and was twice a POW, but escaped both times. 
   Kyle returns to Jenny's home, where they bond by riding dirt bikes 
   together (where an obvious stunt double is used for Ms. Blair) and 
   talking about their pasts. Sheriff Pough wants to end this whole 
   situation peacefully (both he and Mr. Bellows are not bad men at 
   all), but since Deputy Dave has the hots for Jenny, he disregards the 
   Sheriff's advice and gathers all the regular town goons to lay siege 
   on Jenny's house while Mr. Bellows is out of town on business. This 
   leads to many chases, stunts and gunfights, but the difference here 
   is that Kyle doesn't want to kill anyone. That's not sayong he won't 
   lay plenty of whup-ass on them, though. When the good-old boys take 
   Kyle prisoner, he must escape his bonds one final time and teach all 
   the goons a lesson before living happily ever after with Jenny and

   was very low on the humor scale, <B><A HREF="ruckus_1981d.htm">RUCKUS</A></B> 
   contains the right amount of hicksploitation laughs, usually at the 
   expense of character actor supreme Matt Clark (who always does the 
   wrong thing at the right time here), mixed with some well-staged 
   action set pieces. There's hardly any blood spilled here (although it 
   is obvious some trims were made to achieve a PG Rating, since the 
   PG-13 Rating didn't exist yet), but there are plenty of car crashes 
   and chases, explosions (there's an excellent police car explosion 
   where the stuntman barely makes it out alive) and stunts, probably to 
   give Kleven's stunt buddies a chance to shine. The excellent cast of 
   experienced character actors (both Richard Farnsworth and Ben Johnson 
   started out as stuntmen) also helps <B><A HREF="ruckus_1981b.htm">RUCKUS</A></B> 
   be better than it has any right to be, but it does have its charms 
   even if Benedict and Blair (who still has her baby fat here) make for 
   a pretty bland romantic couple. Worth at least one viewing if only to 
   see how action films changed when the 70's ended and the 80's began.

    They are pursued across the Florida Everglades by a group of Cuban 
   soldiers (commanded by John Saxon) which leads to car chases (and 
   plenty of explosions), airboat chases (more explosions), gunfights 
   and the occasional snake or two. We never really know why the guys 
   are being chased (something about Reinhold taking infrared photos out 
   of the plane window), but it leads to many perilous, and sometimes 
   very funny, situations. Along the way they pick up a girl (the 
   wonderful Anne McEnroe), who turns out to be quite handy when the 
   chips are down.&nbsp; The whole film is quite breezy and enjoyable 
   and full of funny little bits that will bring a smile to your face. 
   They get picked up by a teenager who turns out to be quite a 
   daredevil (and leads to Reinhold biting his tongue). They escape a 
   kidnapping attempt by jumping out of the back of a moving truck and 
   land in the middle of a munitions testing field. They steal an

   spree, shooting men, stabbing and raping women and hitting a 
   handicapped wheelchair-bound man over the head with a beer bottle 
   (!), the detective is also leaving a trail of bodies in his search 
   for the killer, shooting everyone who gets in his way (including a

   eventually joins forces with a private detective (Billy Franklin) and

   (1973) -</B> Early 70's action film directed/produced by Filipino 
   stalwart Cirio H. Santiago, one of his very first to get a U.S. 
   theatrical release (through Roger Corman's New World Pictures). Jim 
   Haygood (James Iglehart of Santiago's <B><A HREF="action.htm#FightingMad1978">FIGHTING

   Major brags about sharing a female rebel (that Jim captured) for sex

   showgirls: Amanda (Carol <A HREF="savage_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/savage poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Speed;

   and Vicki (Lada Edmund Jr.; <B><A HREF="rape_squad_1974.htm">RAPE SQUAD</A></B> 
   - 1974), a knife thrower, who both work in a local cabaret. When the 
   two women are visited by a horny Filipino Minister of Defense 
   (Santiago regular Vic Diaz; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Equalizer2000">EQUALIZER
    2000</A></B> - 1986; <B><A HREF="action.htm#LiveByTheFist">LIVE BY 
   THE FIST</A></B> - 1992), it leads to a series of events where Vicki 
   is captured and tortured (with an electric prod to her vagina) by the 
   government and Jim and Amanda escape, only to be captured by the 
   rebel guerillas when their jeep runs out of gas. Jim proves 
   beneficial to the rebels' cause when he saves their ass by diverting 
   enemy fire (he radios-in to the Army and has them shell their own 
   troops!), so the rebels accept him and Amanda into the fold. The 
   first thing they do is break Vicki and rebel leader Flores (Eddie 
   Guitierrez) out of prison while disguised as firemen. Flores and 
   female rebel leader China (Aura Aurea) are still a little reticent in 
   trusting Jim, but his vast military experience and street smarts soon 
   wins them over. Eventually, Jim becomes a leader of the rebels and 
   devises a plan to capture the Minister of Defense, but a traitor in 
   their ranks may spell doom for the rebel movement. The finale takes 
   place at a radio station, where a pirate broadcast goes out to all 
   the citizens exposing government corruption, while Jim and the rebels 
   defend the station until the broadcast is complete. The traitor, 
   along with some good guys and gals, are killed in the ensuing battle, 
   but the rebels live on to fight another day.&nbsp; This mixture of 
   action and exploitation elements gels quite nicely under Santiago's 
   steady hand. There's a ton of nudity on view (even some 
   full-frontal), as well as plenty of gunfights, explosions and even a 
   dollop of gore. The script, by Ed Medard (possibly a pseudonym for 
   Santiago), also has plenty of political and racial intrigue, as it 
   seems to compare the rebels' plight in the Philippines with that of 
   the Civil Rights movement in America. James Iglehart (who also 
   starred in the Santiago-produced <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#BambooGodsIronMen">BAMBOO
    GODS AND IRON MEN</A></B> [1974]) does a good job here as an angry 
   black man (the Filipino government even goes as far as to label him a 
   &quot;black savage&quot;) who shares a lot in common with the rebels 
   and teaches them techniques he learned back on the mean streets of 
   America. Santiago, whose other 70's films include <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#FlyMe1973">FLY

   action and political intrigue with numerous scenes of female nudity 
   and nearly every woman in the cast gets the chance to display their 
   assets. Not everything about this film is taken seriously, though, as 
   there are a few comical scenes, such as when Vicki interrogates an 
   enemy soldier with her knife-throwing talents or when Vic Diaz gets a 
   phone call in mid-cunnilingus from Ken Metcalfe. This is also the 
   earliest example of Santiago using his trademark &quot;man on

    JUSTICE</A><A NAME="SavageJustice1988"></A> (1988) -</B> Here's a 
   Filipino actioner that actually received a U.S. DVD release, even if 
   it's only on a budget label. Some unnamed Far East country goes into 
   revolution mode, forcing all Americans, including Ambassador Allan 
   Howard (Ken Metcalfe; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomanHunt1972">THE 
   WOMAN HUNT</A></B> - 1972), his wife Margaret (Liz Shepherd) and 
   daughter Sarah (Julia Montgomery; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Girls Nite Out">GIRLS
    NITE OUT</A></B> - 1983) to flee the U.S. Embassy in a hurry. Sarah, 
   who is dressed in Army fatigues, rides in the back of her father's 
   car as they are given a military escort to the airport, when, 
   suddenly, their convoy is attacked by the revolutionaries and 
   everyone is killed except Sarah, who is captured and taken prisoner. 
   Sanchez (Raul Vernal; <B><A HREF="muslim_magnum_357_1986.htm">MUSLIM 
   MAGNUM .357</A></B> - 1986), the leader of the revolutionaries, takes 
   an instant shine to Sarah and makes her his bitch (even branding her 
   with his mark!). One year later, rice farmer (and ex-Special Forces 
   soldier) Rick (Steven Memel) lives a peaceful life with his wife An 
   Lee (Millicent Bautista), working in the rice fields and enjoying his 
   life. The town doct<A HREF="savage_justice_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/savage justice dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>or
    (Anthony East; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Sisterhood1987">THE SISTERHOOD</A></B> 
   - 1987) informs Rick that Sanchez intends to raid the village and 
   wants Rick to use his military experience to train the villagers to 
   defend themselves, but the now-pacifistic Rick refuses. That will 
   soon change. Sanchez and his goons, which now includes a fully 
   converted and battle-trained Sarah, invade the village (they arrive 
   in cars and motorcycles that look like hand-me-downs from one of 
   Cirio H. Santiago's post-nuke films) and shoot-up the village 
   marketplace. A series of events occur where Angelica (Chanda Romero), 
   Sanchez's second-in-command, viciously runs over An Lee, killing her, 
   and then jealously shoots Sarah, leaving her for dead in the village 
   square. Rich arrives at the village too late, finds his wife's bloody 
   and broken body and vows revenge. A wounded Sarah comes stumbling 
   through town and is recognized by her old Embassy housekeeper Sun Lee 
   (Esther Chavez), who nurses Sarah back to health. Rick reluctantly 
   agrees to partner-up with Sarah to bring Sanchez down, but the 
   question soon becomes: Is Sarah doing this to avenge for the deaths 
   of her parents or does she want to get even with Angelica for making 
   her past year a hell on Earth? While Sarah leads five martial monks 
   on a mission to receive a secret arms cache, Rick trains the 
   villagers for combat and waits for Sanchez's eventual return. Can 
   Sarah return with the weapons before Sanchez arrives? Will Sarah 
   teach bitch Angelica a lesson she will never forget? What do you 
   think?&nbsp; This is a stunt-filled and explosion-heavy actioner, 
   that, unfortunately, wears too much of it's heart on it's sleeve. 
   Director Joey Romero, the son of Filipino exploitation legend Eddie 
   Romero (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Beast Yellow Night">BEAST OF THE 
   YELLOW NIGHT</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Savage Sisters">SAVAGE
    SISTERS</A></B> - 1974), displays too much sappy sentimentalism, as 
   the screenplay, by David Howard and Parker Bratel, force-feeds the 
   viewers plenty of pacifist dialogue (We get it. War is bad. Peace is 
   good.) and pseudo-intellectual fortune cookie parables. All is not 
   lost, though. There's some strange shit on view here, such as when 
   Sarah and the five monks have a run-in with a gang that lives on an 
   abandoned ship. The gang's leader, a dwarf (played by Rey Big Boy, a 
   familiar face in countless Filipino post-nuke and action films, who, 
   for once, actually gets a screen credit), makes Sarah fight his best 
   man in a one-on-one match-up, which she easily wins. Sarah and the 
   dwarf (who is dressed nattily in a three-piece suit!) then become 
   friends and some of his gang join Sarah in her cause. As Sarah, the 
   monks and her new friends leave in a boat, the dwarf and his 
   followers can be heard yelling &quot;Hey diddle-diddle!&quot; over 
   and over in some victory chant. I haven't got a clue what it means, 
   but it's weird as hell. There's also some pretty good stunts 
   (including a nice slow-motion jump off a waterfalls by Sarah and 
   Rick), bloody deaths (with plenty of bullet squibs), numerous 
   gunfights and plenty of explosions but, strangely, no nudity, 
   although the film does come close when Angelica sexually assaults 
   Sarah during a torture session in the beginning when she is captured.

    graphic, often brutal, revenge melodrama centering on overage high 
   school tough girl Brenda (Linda Blair) enacting her own brand of 
   street justice on a gang of thugs who raped her deaf-mute sister 
   Heather (Linnea Quigley) and killed her soon-to-be- married best 
   friend Rachel (by throwing her off a bridge). There's death by 
   crossbow, bear traps, hit and run and fire. The leader of the gang, 
   Jake (well-played by Robert Dryer), is an unredeemable punk who 
   refuses to sit back and be killed, making for an exciting finale. 
   There's plenty of nudity (even Blair looks good this time around), 
   tough talk (the word &quot;cunt&quot; is used by both men and women) 
   and extreme violence to make this film a good choice for fans of this 
   type of film (you know who you are). I first saw this in the theaters

    - BUCKSTONE COUNTY PRISON</A><A NAME="SeaboBuckstoneCount"></A> 
   (1978) -</B> Shelby, North Carolina's favorite son, Earl Owenby, 
   produces and stars as Amos Seabo, a half-breed bounty tracker hired 
   by Sheriff Deese (Sunset Carson) to bring back two escaped prisoners 
   from the nearby Buckstone County Prison, run by the iron-fisted 
   Warden Coley (Don &quot;Red&quot; Barry), who has a severe dislike 
   for Seabo (Seabo was dishonorably discharged from the Korean War and 
   may have had something to do with the death of Warden Coley's son, 
   but more information on both of those subjects will be revealed as 
   the film progresses). The Sheriff wants Seabo to bring back the 
   prisoners alive, but when they invade the home of a poor black family 
   and one of the prisoners tries to rape the family's young daughter, 
   Seabo has no choice but to shoot one of the escapees when he is 
   threatened with a pitchfork and the father shoots the other prisoner 
   in the back (Seabo takes the blame for both deaths, because he's just 
   that kind of man). Sheriff Deese's corrupt underling, Deputy Jess 
   Clary (Ron Lampkin; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#DarkSunday1976">DARK SUNDAY</A></B> 
   - 1976, also starring Owensby), believes Seabo is guilty of murder 
   for shooting the prisoner in the back (he not only calls Seabo a 
   &quot;redneck&quot;, he also believes he is a communist!), so he 
   conspires with Warden Coley to find a way to incarcerate him in the 
   Warden's prison. Meanwhile, Seabo (who walks around with his 
   trademark sawed-off shotgun strapped to his hip) forces some local 
   bigots to <A HREF="buckstone_county_prison_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/buckstone county prison poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="319" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>destroy
    their own car when they deface his Jeep with racial epithets. He 
   then goes to the local whorehouse, where prostitute Effie (Holly 
   Conover) makes him breakfast before he and local redneck Reb Stock 
   (Country singer David Allan Coe) have an altercation over something 
   said about Seabo's father and Seabo ends up accidentally decking 
   Deputy Jess instead. Seabo is sent to Buckstone County Prison on 
   charges of assaulting an officer and Warden Coley couldn't be happier 
   that this &quot;communist traitor&quot; is now one of his prisoners. 
   The Warden threatens to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; Seabo until he can't 
   stand up and is beaten with a billy club by sadistic prison guard 
   Jimbo (stunt coordinator Ed Parker), who can beat the shit out of a 
   prisoner without leaving a mark. Seabo makes friends with stuttering 
   black prisoner Zack (Leonard Dixon), while the Warden and Jimbo make 
   his life a living hell, beating him daily and forcing other prisoners 
   to make his every waking hour a fate worse than death. When the 
   prisoners finally realize that Seabo can be beaten but not broken, 
   they slowly come to respect him, especially when they see how he 
   reacts when Jimbo beats Zack within an inch of his life for not being 
   able to say his name without stuttering (<B>Jimbo:</B> &quot;What's 
   my name?&quot; <B>Zack:</B> &quot;Mister J-j-j-j-imbo.&quot; WHACK!). 
   When six prisoners escape from a federal penitentiary with the help 
   of Reb Stock as their guide, Sheriff Deese offers Seabo a pardon 
   (over the Warden's protests and the eventual truth about his son's 
   death and Seabo's dishonorable discharge revealed) if he brings the 
   prisoners and Reb back alive. Seabo brings four of the prisoners back 
   alive (he is forced to shoot and kill one prisoner and Reb Stock, as 
   well as forcing Deputy Jess swallow all six bullets in his revolver), 
   but Warden Coley has an ambush waiting for Seabo as he escorts the 
   prisoners into Buckstone. All of the prisoners are shot dead in a 
   hail of gunfire, but Seabo disappears, never to be seen or heard from 
   again. A legend is born.&nbsp; At 117 minutes, <B>SEABO</B> 
   (originally titled simply <B><A HREF="buckstone_county_prison_1978b.htm">BUCKSTONE
    COUNTY PRISON</A></B> before Owensby video-generated the 
   &quot;Seabo&quot; name before the title and released it on his own 
   VHS label in uncut form for the first time) may be a tad long in the 
   tooth, but it delivers in the violence and revenge departments, if 
   not the acting department. Thankfully, Earl Owensby as Seabo is a man 
   of few words (he also looks chunkier than in most his other films) 
   and director Jimmy Huston (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#DarkSunday1976">DARK

   actor; namely, giving him as few words as possible to speak and

   (1980), but it is a fine example of a prison revenge flick, with 
   bouts of racist dialogue, bloody violence and even some bits of humor 
   (the car destruction sequence is hilarious). Both Don &quot;Red&quot;

   police shoot tear gas into the bank and one thief is shot trying to 
   escape. Two more surrender and the last one is shot in the head by

    any more. In what can be best described as the worst case of 
   retaining information, Vito and his squad are next seen gunning down 
   dozens of drug smugglers and then Vito shoots and kills the local mob 
   boss' son in a bar fight. Vito is suspended from the force for not 
   listening to the police chief. The mob boss is not so pleased losing 
   a million dollar shipment of drugs to the police, but he's more mad 
   about losing his son, so he vows to get revenge on Vito. He sends a 
   package bomb to Vito's house, but it only kills Vito's wife. Now Vito 
   vows revenge. The rest of the film is a series of shootouts and 
   fisticuffs as Vito and the boss' gang go after each other. Vito 
   becomes legendary and the populace consider him a modern day Robin 
   Hood! That is, until the mob boss makes Vito look like a ruthless 
   killer which force the people catch him and crucify him on a cross! 
   Only an impassioned plea from Vito's young son saves him and then 
   Vito faces the mob boss one-on-one. The mob boss has a few knives up 
   his sleeve in his climatic battle with Vito in a graveyard. Put your 
   brain in neutral and be prepared to be sent on a very surreal voyage. 
   The kind of voyage where bars play an instrumental version of Michael 
   Jackson's &quot;Beat It&quot;, there's an awkward martial arts fight 
   every 10 minutes and the dialogue has to be heard to be appreciated. 
   Director Raymond &quot;Rey&quot; Malonzo, who also acts in this film 
   as Vito using the name &quot;Reginald King&quot; (and also directed <B><A HREF="#Classified Operatio">CLASSIFIED
    OPERATION</A></B> - 1985 [a.k.a. <B><A HREF="fire_dragon_1985.htm">FIRE
    DRAGON</A></B>]), also tries to inject sappy sentimentalism into the 
   mix, as the scene where we are introduced to Vito's wife and son. 
   Vito gives his son some money to go out and buy candy so he can do 
   the down 'n dirty with his wife, only to have his son say, &quot;Dad, 
   I don't like candy!&quot; I had fun counting the times the mob boss' 
   cowardly gang would plead, &quot;Please don't kill me!&quot;, 
   whenever Vito would beat them in a fight. It's also filled with 
   hilarious dubbing, such as, &quot;Stone that son of a bitch!&quot; 
   and &quot;Take him down from the cross. Relieve him from his 
   suffering.&quot; I believe Malonzo was also trying to put some 
   religious subtext into this film, but it gets lost among the gunshots 
   and badly-staged fights. This film has a weird type of energy to it, 
   such as the scene when Vito's son pleads for his father's life only 
   to get shot in the arm by one of the boss' goons for his good deed. 
   That alone is worth at least one viewing. Also starring Charlie Davao

   Wanjing is found raped, naked and unconscious from a drug overdose in 
   a discoteque/drugden, Wanfei (Chen Ping) makes it her mission in life 
   to kill every drug dealer she can get her hands on (She says, 
   &quot;Drugs, drugs, I hate it so much!&quot;). She pretends to be a 
   drug-addicted hooker named Sally (apparently, &quot;Sally&quot; also 
   means &quot;kill me&quot; in Cantonese) and picks up a man called 
   &quot;Third Brother&quot; (these are literal translations from the 
   English subtitles, so bear with me) and offers to have sex with him 
   as long as he brings her to his drug lab and gets her high. Once 
   there, she gets topless and stabs Third Brother to death with her 
   bracelet, which transforms into a double-bladed knife. She then kills 
   two other workers after finding out that Long Tou (Chan Shen), also 
   known as Brother Ma, was the man who raped her sister and made her a 
   brain-dead addict (we see her sister in a psych ward room, a

   thinks a rival organization called the Red Cabinet is responsible for 
   the recent destruction of several of his labs and orders his men to

   (Yuen Hua), also known as the &quot;Drug Smasher&quot;, seems to be 
   the only honest cop on the force. Every time he gets a good tip on a 
   drug deal, some crooked cop will call up the bad guys and he looks 
   like a fool when he goes to make a bust. When Deng goes on a bust at 
   He Jingye's house and turns up nothing (thanks to crooked cop's 
   tip-off), Wanfei accuses him of being jealous of her relationship 
   with He Jingye (he actually is a little bit!). Deng's old cop boss, 
   Leifan, now works for the &quot;Boss&quot; and tries to bribe Deng 
   into joining them, but he throws the money back at Leifan and tells 
   him, &quot;You get yourself a good coffin with this money!&quot; Five 
   men with pantyhose on their heads attack Deng and Wanfei with 
   miniature shovels and pipes and Brother Ma cripples Deng with a blow 
   to the head (He says, &quot;Drug Smasher? Potato masher!&quot;). 
   Wanfei then goes after Brother Ma, tricking him into taking her to 
   the Boss' whorehouse, where she talks Brother Ma into setting up a 
   meeting with the Boss. When she meets him at his home, she attempts 
   to kill him, but fails. She is captured and finally learns of her 
   boyfriend's betrayal. Luckily, she doctored Brother Ma's drug stash,

   anti-drug stance that, for lack of a better word, is comical. 
   Wanfei's sister becomes a blubbering, brain-damaged mental patient 
   after only one fix and everyone shown doing drugs is either a hooker, 
   gang member or a disco-loving sweat monkey. Ignore the film's 
   simplistic, moralistic politics and just wallow in the sleazy fun and 
   violence. The most off-the-wall character here is Brother Ma, as his 
   fey, gay-like characteristics disguise an interior that can best be 
   described as animalistic. He not only rapes Wanjing, he hits on every 
   woman he meets, even if all his physical actions and body movements 
   make him look like a total flamer. This film also takes a dim view of 
   the police where, besides Deng, all the other cops are crooked or 
   buffoons (one cop even says to Deng that he's crooked because he gets 
   paid so little for being a cop). There are a lot of visual highlights 
   here, especially the way they hide Wanjing's pubic hair from the 
   camera (by using Brother Ma's excited fist to hide the offending body 
   part). There's also a pillow fight between Wanfei and whorehouse 
   madam Lilly, the Boss whips one of his girls while watching porn on a 
   super 8 projector (he also has a hidden S&amp;M room where he 
   attempts to rape Wanfei), one guy is thrown off a building with a 
   noose around his neck (ala <B><A HREF="omen_1976.htm">THE OMEN</A></B> 
   [1976] , filmed the same year) and Wanfei's erect nipples are 
   prominently displayed in several close-up throughout the film. The 
   finale, where Brother Ma attempts to rape Wanfei on a sewer pipe and 
   the Boss whips some poor chained-up girl in his S&amp;M room is 
   classic Chinese cinema. After killing Brother Ma in the sewer, Wanfei 
   drives a car through the Boss' living room, grabs a shotgun and 
   begins blowing everyone away, which climaxes in a pretty nifty 
   slow-motion waterbed explosion. She then goes to her boyfriends house 
   and teaches him a painful lesson which he will never forget. This is 
   the Hong Kong equivalent of the blaxploitation flick <B><A HREF="coffy_1973.htm">COFFY</A></B>

    The film opens with crime boss Pascal (Raymond Pellegrin; <B><A HREF="special_cop_in_action_1976.htm">A
    SPECIAL COP IN ACTION</A></B> - 1976) and his goons interrupting a 
   meeting with a smuggling outfit who are interested in listening to a 
   Swiss smuggler, who is telling them that they will make more money 
   with him rather than with Pascal, whom is their boss. After killing 
   the lookout point blank with a machine gun, Pascal confronts his 
   former smuggling outfit, telling them that this Swiss prick will not 
   give them a better deal (&quot;He's not me!&quot;) and takes the 
   Swiss man away. He has his goons beat up the smuggling group and then 
   shoot them all in the legs for trying to betray him! We then see 
   Police Lt. Domenico Malacarne (Luc Merenda; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   - 1973) undercover as a gun smuggler, making a deal with two wise-ass 
   Portuguese men, Rio (Elio Zamuto; <B><A HREF="how_to_kill_a_judge_1974.htm">HOW
    TO KILL A JUDGE</A></B> - 1975) and Raba (Massimo Sarchielli; <B><A HREF="minute_to_pray_a_second_to_die_1968.htm">A
    MINUTE TO PRAY, A SECOND TO DIE</A></B> - 1968) to drive a truck 
   containing &quot;cinderblocks&quot; (a code word for hot guns). 
   Domenico doesn't like the way these two men act, so he tells them he 
   will think about it. While Domenico and his beautiful girlfriend 
   Sandra (Delia Boccardo; <B><A HREF="high_crime_1973.htm">HIGH CRIME</A></B> 
   - 1973) are having a bite to eat in a bistro, he notices some strange 
   activity outside, so he goes to investigate. It turns out to be a 
   jewelry store robbery, the robbers killing the owner as he runs 
   outside and yells that he has been robbed. After a short foot chase, 
   the main robber steals a car and speeds away, so Domenico hops in a 
   car driven by his partner Garrito&nbsp; (Rosario Borelli; <B><A HREF="death_rage_1976.htm">DEATH
    RAGE</A></B> - 1976) and gives chase (This is a long car chase, full 
   of great stunts and filmed for maximum impact). It all ends when 
   Garrito and the robber get into a game of chicken, Domenico telling 
   his partner not to swerve and he doesn't, getting into a head-on 
   collision, resulting in Domenico arresting the injured robber.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Later that day, Domenico's superior, the Superintendent of Police 
   (Gianni Santuccio; <B><A HREF="queens_of_evil_1970.htm">QUEENS OF EVIL</A></B> 
   - 1970) holds a press conference and praises Domenico for a job well 
   done. Reporter Barbara (Monica Monet; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   - 1974) wants to do a story on Domenico, but he refuses. He won't 
   even let her cameraman take his picture, but, as we will learn later, 
   there is a reason for that. He is doing something that is not legal 
   and he doesn't need the exposure. After the press conference, 
   Domenico meets his nameless father (Salvo Randone; <B><A HREF="my_dear_killer_1972.htm">MY
    DEAR KILLER</A></B> - 1972), a sergeant at another police precinct 
   (so I'll call him &quot;Sgt. Malacarne&quot;), outside in the police 
   parking lot. He asks his father why he didn't attend the press 
   conference and he says he didn't want to get in the way of his son, 
   whom he believes is an excellent police officer. If he only knew! 
   That night, Sandra tells Domenico that he treats her as a prostitute, 
   only seeing her when he wants to have sex and he says that's not 
   true, his job keeps him too busy to spend a lot of time with her, but 
   that doesn't mean he does not care about her (the word &quot;love' is 
   not in his dictionary).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then find out just why Domenico is so busy. It turns out he is on 
   the take, helping Pascal and his mouthpiece lawyer Mazzanti (Richard 
   Conte; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EvilEye1975">EVIL EYE</A></B> 
   - 1975) with their coffee and cigarette smuggling business (there was 
   a huge black market for both in Italy at the time). He tells Pascal 
   that he wants nothing to do with their gun and drug-smuggling 
   businesses, but Pascal has a more pressing matter on his agenda. He 
   wants Domenico to get him a report filed by a man called Esposito 
   (Vittorio Caprioli; Di Leo's <B><A HREF="rulers_of_the_city_1976.htm">RULERS
    OF THE CITY</A></B> - 1976), who wrote down the license plates of 
   the car blocking the entrance to his house that his 
   &quot;associates&quot; were driving, because, &quot;Our friends don't 
   like being noted down on a piece of paper.&quot; It turns out 
   Esposito reported it to Domenico's father at his district in Santa 
   Maria, but Domenico doesn't know it yet. Trying to get that report 
   from his father is going to be more difficult than Domenico could 
   ever imagine. It will turn out to be deadly. But before that happens, 
   a group of school kids discover a body in a cement-filled oil drum, 
   all they can see are three fingers sticking out of the dried cement. 
   Could this be related to Pascal's problem? Damn right it is! We then 
   discover that Garrito is also on the take, but Domenico makes him 
   sell his Ferrari, because no cop should be able to afford such a car. 
   If anyone were to discover he owns such a car, it would raise red 
   flags. Garrito agrees to get rid of his car immediately.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Domenico goes to his father's office and asks him for the report, 
   but he won't let him walk away with it, telling Domenico it is 
   already registered. Sgt. Malacarne tells his son not to worry, the 
   report will be filed away and forgotten, because Esposito is a serial 
   complainer; he comes to his office several times a week to complain 
   about one thing or another, including troubles with his own cat! 
   Domenico visits Esposito to see for himself and learns that the car 
   that was blocking the entrance to his house had Swiss plates. 
   Esposito explains, &quot;The guy in the Swiss car was drunk because 
   as he walked away the others were holding him up. I'm betting the guy 
   was dead. They came back without the drunk and drove off. How do I 
   know this? Because it was 7:30. At 7:30 I have to go out and get milk 
   for my cat, because he likes milk at night.&quot; Domenico asks 
   Esposito if he saw the plates for both cars and he says yes, the 
   other car had Swiss plates, too, and the driver was wearing a polka 
   dot bowtie and he was hefty. Domenico immediately knows that Esposito 
   is describing Pascal, because he only wears bowties and he's a hefty 
   man. When Domenico returns to his car, Pascal's transvestite goon, 
   Gianmaria (Gino Milli; <B><A HREF="property_is_no_longer_a_theft_1973.htm">PROPERTY
    IS NO LONGER A THEFT</A></B> - 1973), is waiting for him in his car, 
   asking for the report. Domenico tells him not to worry, the report is 
   buried in the police archives and no one will ever see it. This does 
   not placate Pascal, who sends two goons to Esposito's house, where 
   they suffocate him by putting a plastic bag over his head. They even 
   kill Esposito's cat by putting it inside a plastic bag and sealing it up!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, Sgt. Malacarne phones his son and tells him to meet 
   him at Esposito's house. Sgt. Malacarne is suspicious of his son for 
   asking for Esposito's report the day before he is found dead, but he 
   reasons that his son is such a great cop, the only reason he asked 
   for the report was because he was working on a secret investigation. 
   The look on Domenico's face tells a different story and his father 
   immediately knows something is wrong, but he is not expecting what 
   comes next. Domenico demands his father hand over the report, telling 
   him to quit his job and to disappear for a few days, saying now that 
   Esposito is dead, he is the only one who knows anything and it could 
   be deadly for him if he stays put. Sgt. Malacarne is pissed, telling 
   his son he won't obstruct justice, not even for his own son. Domenico 
   tells him he's just trying to save his life; these &quot;people&quot; 
   don't play around. Sgt. Malacarne then realizes that his son is an 
   accomplice to murder and yells out, &quot;Oh my God! It can't 
   be!&quot; Domenico retorts, &quot;Stop weeping in your pillow! Don't 
   make a big deal out of it. I'm corrupt. I'm a traitor. I've saved up 
   60 million (lire), I have a fancy girl and when I speak, everyone 
   stands up!&quot; His father can't believe his son sold out; getting 
   paid to do illegal things, which goes against everything he believes 
   in. Domenico tells his father to quit preaching to him, he seen what 
   kind of life he has lead, &quot;licking the shine off other people's 
   shoes till their toes showed!&quot; Domenico tries to make himself 
   feel better saying he saw his father beat people to death to make his 
   bosses happy, made up phony stories to convict people and has abused 
   his power, telling his father that the only difference between them 
   is that he gets paid to do the exact same things. Sgt. Malacarne 
   gives his son a disappointing look and walks out of the room, 
   Domenico yelling for him to turn his son in, if &quot;they&quot; let 
   him live long enough. He will regret saying that.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Pascal confronts Domenico at a party at an art gallery, demanding 
   that the report be destroyed. A certain Countess Nevio (Marisa 
   Traversi; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein 80">FRANKENSTEIN
    '80</A></B> - 1972) from Switzerland has identified the body in the 
   oil drum as that of her husband. It won't be long until the body will 
   be connected to Pascal, which is why he needs the report destroyed. 
   Domenico tells Pascal that the report will be delivered to him 
   tonight, but it will cost him plenty of money to get it. Pascal 
   agrees and Domenico phones his father and begs him for the report. 
   Later that day, Sgt. Malacarne hands his son the report and tells him 
   he can sell out if he wants, but he never wants to see him again; he 
   is no longer his son, he's no better than a crook. Sgt. Malacarne 
   walks out of the luxury apartment Domenico pays Sandra to live in and 
   Sandra appears to comfort a hurt Domenico. While Sgt. Malacarne is 
   sitting in a park nursing his emotional scars, Gianmaria sneaks up 
   behind him and throws him to the ground, stepping on his head, 
   putting it underwater at the edge of lake and killing him (We're not 
   supposed to know it is Gianmaria, but it is quite obvious). This act 
   of cowardice is all Domenico needs to finally change his stripes, but 
   before he learns about his father's murder, he delivers the report to 
   Pascal, who burns it in front of him as Domenico demand 20,000 lire 
   for delivering it to him. Mazzanti tells him the money will be wired 
   to his account tomorrow morning, but Pascal has no intent of paying him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Domenico is making love to Sandra, the phone rings and it's 
   Garrito. He tells Domenico to meet him at the park immediately, not 
   telling him why. When Domenico arrives at the park and sees the dead 
   body of his father, all he has on his mind is revenge, especially 
   when he hears that a &quot;lady&quot; with long blonde hair was seen 
   leaving the scene of the crime. He goes to Gianmaria's pad, beats up 
   all of his strange friends and Gianmaria threatens Domenico with a 
   switchblade, threatening to cut &quot;handsome's&quot; face. Domenico 
   bangs Gianmaria's head against the wall repeatedly and when he falls 
   to the floor, snaps the transvestite's neck with a twist of his feet. 
   We then see two of Pascal's goons slapping the shit out of Sandra, 
   then kneeing her it the face an strangling her with a phone cord (as 
   she dies, all we hear is a busy tone on the phone's receiver). A 
   bunch of Pascal's thugs then go after Domenico, trapping him in a 
   liquor store. He phones Garrito and tells him to come immediately. 
   When Garrito arrives, with another officer, Domenico jumps in the car 
   and they head to Sandra's place. Domenico tells the officer to ring 
   the doorbell on the back door (he knows something is wrong) and when 
   the officer rings the doorbell, it explodes, killing the officer. 
   Domenico and Garrito run inside and find Sandra dead on her bed. 
   Domenico's Superintendent puts him on indefinite suspension for 
   &quot;health reasons. This leads to a short car chase between 
   Pascal's head killer (Loris Bazzocchi; <B><A HREF="black_lemons_1970.htm">BLACK
    LEMONS</A></B> - 1970) resulting in the killer's death. Mazzanti 
   offers to set up Pascal for Domenico (after Pascal calls Mazzanti a 
   &quot;third-rate mouthpiece&quot; who isn't worth killing) and they 
   trap him in the basement of an abandoned building and Domenico shoots 
   Pascal point-blank in the face. Just when you think it is all over, 
   Garrito comes up behind Domenico and shoots him in the back of the 
   head. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE END</FONT></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This excellent Eurocrime film contains some terrific acting from Luc 
   Merenda and Salvo Randone as father and son. Their scenes together 
   pack an emotional wallop for the viewer, especially the sequence 
   where father discovers his son is nothing but a crook. Luc Merenda is 
   a hit-or-miss actor. When he is on target, his performances are quite 
   extraordinary, such as here, but he sometimes phones-in a performance 
   (Di Leo's <B><A HREF="nick_the_sting_1976.htm">NICK THE STING</A></B> 
   [1976] is a good example) and he is quite terrible. Thankfully, 
   director/screenwriter Fernando Di Leo (Story by Sergio Donato; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WeekendMurders1970">WEEKEND
    MURDERS</A></B> - 1970) knows Merenda's limitations, using him in 
   several of his films, giving him meaty roles he can chew on and 
   making his performances award-worthy and memorable (all except <B>NICK</B>,
    which is a rare Di Leo loser). The two car chases here may not be in 
   the same league as <B><A HREF="french_connection_1971.htm">THE FRENCH CONNECTION</A></B> 
   (1971; although there are many similarities between the two films), 
   but stunt coordinator/driver extraordinaire Remy Julienne gives the

   to make them stand out from most films in this genre (but still not 
   as good as the one in <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#StrangeShadows1976">STRANGE
    SHADOWS IN AN EMPTY ROOM</A></B> - 1976, which Julienne also 
   coordinated). The plot to this film follows closely to the way it was 
   in the Italian police forces during the time. Most police officials 
   were on the take. Being a police officer and taking graft from 
   criminals was considered normal until a major crackdown got most of 
   these officials shitcanned, but it wouldn't be until nearly a decade 
   later until it happened. This was one of the major reasons why law 
   and order in Italy was in such dire shape during most of the '70s 
   (mirroring the police force in New York City at the time), which is 
   the reason why the Eurocrime genre was created. The genre basically 
   told the Italian justice system that they knew what was really going 
   on and calling them on it, even if people in other countries never 
   understood the reasons, preferring to enjoy the films as just pure 
   entertainment. But, believe me, there were valid reasons why these 
   films were being cranked out. Today we look at them as action 
   thrillers, but, back in the day, they were a reflection on Italian 
   society and the blind eye people turned to the law and order/justice 
   system. In other words, these films had a different meaning back in 
   the '70s than they do today. History lesson over. Try to see how many 
   times you can count the <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">J&amp;B
    Scotch bottles</A>, as it appears (in all sizes) scattered 
   throughout the film. This film swims in the stuff! There is also some 
   pretty graphic violence in the film, especially Domenico's death, 
   which comes as quite the shock. There is also some female nudity in 
   the film, but not as much as normal for a film in this genre. Still, 
   this is a recommended delight for fans of Eurocrime, thanks to the 
   acting and non-stop action.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   of heads on sticks, dead naked raped women in huts and bodies of 
   murdered children piled on top of each other like cords of firewood). 
   Unnerved on what he has just witnessed, Hafner orders his men to burn 
   the village down, bodies and all (the platoon were friendly with the 
   villagers), before they grab the boy and move on. As they are 
   traveling through the jungle, the platoon stumbles across two gooks 
   guarding a cave. After killing the two enemy soldiers, Hafner 
   discovers an injured American soldier (Richard Kuhlman) in the cave. 
   He has been held as a POW for so long, he can't remember his name, so 
   Hafner nicknames him &quot;Ghost&quot;. After killing over 20 
   Vietcong at a riverbank, Hafner and his motley group are picked up by 
   helicopter, only to be shot down just as they make it to a remote 
   American jungle outpost called Firebase Gloria. Hafner and Dinardo 
   discover that the outpost's commanding officer, Capt. Williams (John 
   Calvin; <B><A HREF="#PrimaryTarget">PRIMARY TARGET</A></B> - 1988), 
   is nothing but an opium-smoking, brain-dead basketcase (He greets 
   Hafner and Dinardo in the nude while babb<A HREF="siege_of_firebase_gloria_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/siege of firebase gloria poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ling
    about the perfect tits of some centerfold model!), so they frag his 
   ass (they don't kill him, just blow him up a little!) so Hafner can 
   take over commanding the outpost. It's a good thing, too, because a 
   regiment of VC soldiers, commanded by Col. Cao Van (Robert Arevalo), 
   is about to assault Firebase Gloria as part of the Tet Offensive, in 
   which Vietcong soldiers all across South Vietnam lay a massive 
   assault against all American military bases, outposts and embassies. 
   Greatly outnumbered and with limited help on the way, Hafner and his 
   men must endure wave after wave of enemy VC soldiers as they try to 
   defend the outpost and their lives. As the battles get bloodier and 
   the losses pile up on both sides (there's a particularly bloody 
   attack by the enemy on the outpost's hospital), we discover that 
   there are no real superheroes in war, just flesh and blood human 
   beings that are capable of heroic deeds. Still, no matter how heroic 
   you are, you can't outrace a bullet if your name is written on 
   it.&nbsp; This is an unheralded, low-budget masterpiece about a 
   portion of the Vietnam War where both Americans and the Vietcong 
   suffered their greatest amount of casualties (all in a period of 
   about four months). Director Brian Trenchard-Smith (<B><A HREF="action.htm#ManFromHongKong">THE
    MAN FROM HONG KONG</A></B> - 1975; <B><A HREF="#StuntRock">STUNT ROCK</A></B> 
   - 1978; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#DayOfThePanther">DAY OF THE PANTHER</A></B> 
   - 1987), working with a literate script by William Nagle and Tony 
   Johnston, offers a fair and balanced portrayal of both sides of the 
   war, allowing the viewer to witness the brutality and viewpoints from 
   both the Americans and Vietcong. Surprisingly, Trenchard-Smith 
   portrays some of the American soldiers, especially Wing Hauser's (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#DeadManWalking1987">DEAD
    MAN WALKING</A></B> - 1987; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Watchers3">WATCHERS
    III</A></B> - 1994) Dinardo, as capable of performing brutal acts of 
   savagery, such as when he orders his men to kill all the wounded VC 
   laying in a field after their first unsuccessful assault on the 
   outpost (he can't be bothered with dealing with wounded POWs) or his 
   painful interrogation of a wounded VC soldier (whom he kills after 
   extracting the information he needed). The plight of the young 
   Vietnamese boy, who is protected by Dinardo (the boy is the only 
   aspect of the war that keeps Dinardo from going completely bonkers 
   and proves to be his Achilles' heel), is the perfect metaphor of the 
   horrors of war. His fate in the finale is realistic and uncertain, as 
   Col. Cao Van &quot;rescues&quot; him from the Americans and he ends 
   up in the arms of the very same person responsible for giving the 
   orders to kill his parents in the first place. Here, the VC soldiers 
   aren't the faceless demons most war actioners paint them to be. They 
   have the same personal lives and follow the same orders the Americans 
   do. Still, this film wouldn't be half as good as it is if it weren't 
   for the excellent performance and authoritative narration by R. Lee 
   Ermey (<B><A HREF="full_metal_jacket_1987.htm">FULL METAL JACKET</A></B> 
   - 1987; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TerrorWithin2">THE TERROR WITHIN II</A></B> 
   - 1990). He adds an air of authenticity (even during the midst of an 
   all-out assault, he still finds the time to reprimand a helicopter 
   pilot for not shaving!) and grace that may have otherwise been lost 
   by a lesser actor. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of bloody 
   violence and carnage on view (the early sights of the village 
   slaughter; two VC women getting blown to smithereens; the final 
   assault of the outpost), but there's an emotional core that's usually 
   not found in low-budget films of this type (the uneasy professional 
   and personal relationship between Hafner and Dinardo is highly 
   emotional). A must-see. Also starring Albert Popwell, Mark Neely, 
   Gary Hershberger, Clyde R. Jones, Margi Gerard, Erich Hauser, Dan 
   Austin, Henry Strzalkowski and Nick Nicholson as a pot-smoking combat

   which jeopardizes Austin's business of creating new identities for 
   violent criminals), but Carnahan has a list of all Austin's clients, 
   which he threatens to use if harm should come to him and it saves him 
   from being killed (for now). Silk and Detective Yashi (Joe Mari 
   Avellana) are assigned&nbsp; to a case of a murdered body found at 
   the banks of a lake and the more they investigate, the closer they 
   get to Austin. Silk has a more important problem, though. It seems 
   someone is murdering criminals who have recently escaped justice on 
   technicalities. The killer not only murders them, he also cuts-off 
   one of their ears as trophies and the deeper Silk digs into the 
   cases, the more it looks like her lover Tom is responsible. When 
   Carnahan is killed by two men, his girlfriend turns over the list to 
   Silk. Tom is there, too, and when he sees the names on the list&nbsp; 
   and hears a description of Carnahan's killers, he knows it's two old 
   Nam buddies of his, Tyler (Nick Nicholson) and Vernon (Ronnie 
   Patterson), who are now on Austin's payroll. Tom really can't do 
   anything about it since he's also a killer and they know it (Tom use 
   to cut the ears off his gook victims back in Vietnam). As Silk begins 
   interviewing the people on the list, Austin orders a hit on her. Silk 
   has to find a way to stay alive, bring Austin down and deal with her 
   lover being a cold-blooded killer.&nbsp; Set in Honolulu, Hawaii, but 
   filmed in the Philippines (it's all those Filipino extras that give 
   it away), <B><A HREF="silk_1986c.htm">SILK</A></B> has a fairly 
   complicated plot for a Cirio H. Santiago film. The script, by 
   Frederick Bailey (who also co-stars as Detective Brown), juggles 
   several plots at once and manages to generate some real suspense, 
   even if it's hard to keep score sometimes. Cec Verrell (who has the 
   same facial features and stark blue eyes as Meg Foster) is steely 
   cool as Silk (When Austin says to her, &quot;I don't know why they 
   call you Silk.&quot;, she shoots back, &quot;Because I'm so fucking 
   smooth!&quot;), who would rather shoot and ask questions later. 
   Everyone she comes up against ends up dead (whether it be by pistol, 
   shotgun or flaming car wreck) and the only time she actually shoots 
   to wound, she ends up being taken hostage. Director/producer Santiago 
   turned out dozens of these little actioners during the 80's (see 
   reviews for <B><A HREF="#FinalMission1984">FINAL MISSION</A></B> 
   [1984] and <B><A HREF="action.htm#Devastator">THE DEVASTATOR</A></B>

    OF THE EAGLE</A></B> - 1987; <B><A HREF="#NamAngels">NAM ANGELS</A></B> 
   - 1988), but every once in a while, he was capable of churning-out 
   something halfway decent and watchable like this. Make no mistake,

   how to squeeze the most out of a meager budget. <B><A HREF="silk_1986b.htm">S</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="silk_1986b.htm">ILK</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">'s

   detective Jenny 'Silk' Sleighton (Monique Gabrielle, replacing the 
   original film's Cec Verrell) and partner Sgt. Chris Meadows (Bon 
   Vibar) are first seen assaulting a group of Palestine terrorists that 
   have taken over the Israeli Embassy in Honolulu, Hawaii. When one of

   a briefcase containing the &quot;Four Scrolls Of The Temple Of 
   Immortality&quot;, valuable ancient Japanese artifacts that were 
   supposed to be on loan to Gish's museum. Gish hangs the four phoney 
   scrolls in his museum thinking no one will be the wiser (he intends

    the originals and collecting the insurance money when he has the 
   fake ones destroyed in an explosion), but when art expert Tony (Peter 
   Nelson) spots them as fakes, the shit hits the fan. Tony calls 
   Japanese art collector Kashi Hashimura (Joe Mari Avellana) and tells 
   him about the fakes. Kashi contacts his old friend Chris, tells him 
   about the fake scrolls and asks Chris to investigate. Chris, who is 
   about to retire from the force, begins digging into the theft on his 
   own time and nearly gets killed by two of Gish's goons, Trent (Robert 
   Ginnivan) and Dodge (Jim Moss).&nbsp; Chris needs help, so he informs 
   Silk what is going on and they follow Trent and Dodge onto a boat, 
   where Chris is wounded and taken prisoner and Chris has to jump 
   overboard to escape, but not before she grabs one of the real 
   scrolls. Silk's superior, Captain Henry Sharp (Ken Metcalfe), tells 
   her that she is off the case, but we know better, don't we? When one 
   of Gish's goons tries to kill Silk while she is taking a shower, she 
   is forced to kill him (Gratuitous exposed breasts kung-fu alert!). 
   When an exchange of Chris for the scroll goes horribly wrong and 
   Chris is stabbed to death by Trent, Silk grants Chris' dying request 
   and travels to the island of Kona to return the scroll to Kashi, 
   where she meets Tony and a young woman named Holly (Maria Claire), 
   who will both play an important role in Silk's life in the next few 
   days. Trent and Dodge try their best to kill Silk and retrieve the 
   scroll, but she is always on the ball. Gish kidnaps Tony and Kashi in 
   the finale and plans to blow them up, along with his museum and the 
   fake scrolls and collect his insurance money, framing Tony and Kashi 
   as terrorists. Silk and Holly show up in the nick of time and save 
   the day, retrieving the real scrolls, rescuing Tony and killing 
   Trent, while Kashi restrains Gish as they both blow up in the 
   explosion.&nbsp; Those expecting the same fun experience as the first 
   film are bound to be disappointed because returning director Cirio H. 
   Santiago cast the wrong woman in the leading role. Monique Gabrielle (<B><A HREF="angel_eyes_1993.htm">ANGEL
    EYES</A></B> - 1993) may look great naked (she has a couple of nude 
   scenes, including a really blurry slow-motion sex scene with Tony), 
   but she's not much of an actress. Her monotone line readings are 
   simply awful and hamper the film's overall effectiveness. She's a 
   major distraction. Santiago offers a bit of major gore in the 
   beginning of the film, but unfortunately fails to follow through, as 
   the rest of the film is relatively blood-free and predictable (script 
   by Robert King, who also wrote the screenplays to the creepy horror 
   film <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nest1987">THE NEST</A></B> [1987] 
   and the martial arts actioner <B><A HREF="bloodfist_1989.htm">BLOODFIST</A></B> 
   [1989]). While there are a few gunfights, martial arts sequences and 
   car chases, it by no means measures-up to Santiago's usual action 
   standards. Even the big explosion in the finale is an obvious 
   miniature and there is a severe shortage of Santiago's usual 
   overabundant use of bloody bullet squibs. This 76 minute flick is 
   pretty terrible and I am usually very forgiving when it comes to 
   Santiago's films. Skip this and watch the original instead. Also 
   starring Henry Strzalkowski, Jeff Griffith, Archie Ramirez, David

    COAST</A><A NAME="SkeletonCoast1987"></A> (1987) -</B> Anyone who 
   doesn't like Ernest Borgnine doesn't like great actors in my book and 
   here's a rare 80's action film where Borgnine carries most of the 
   film on his broad shoulders. This film opens in Angola, where CIA 
   agent Michael Smith (Jonathan Rands) is taken prisoner at a rebel 
   camp by the soldiers of mean Angola-backed crime lord Major Schneider 
   (Robert Vaughn). Michael happens to be the son of Colonel Bill Smith 
   (Borgnine), who gets information on where his son is being held by 
   corrupt Angolan official Elia (Herbert Lom in a small cameo; both Lom 
   and Borgnine were born in 1917 and both passed away in 2012), in 
   which Bill pays Elia $100,000 in counterfeit bills (!) to get the 
   information. When Elia finds out the money is counterfeit, he nearly 
   blows a gasket and sends Diamond Security head Captain David Simpson 
   (Oliver Reed in a five minute cameo) to stop Bill from rescuing his 
   son. Meanwhile, Bill is putting together a <A HREF="skeleton_coast_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/skeleton coast vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>mercenary

   Greene; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Hands Of Steel">HANDS OF STEEL</A></B> 
   - 1986) to put together a merc team. The team consists of Bill, Rick, 
   Chuck (Leon Isaac Kennedy; <B><A HREF="action.htm#FightingMad1978">FIGHTING
    MAD</A></B> - 1978), Tohsiro (Peter Kwong; <B><A HREF="big_trouble_in_little_china_1986.htm">BIG

    REVENGER</A></B> - 1990), the only female of the group (Bill first 
   spots her naked in a makeshift shower stall in the desert), each one 
   of them a specialist in their own field of expertise (Vosloo and 
   Mulford married after meeting on this film). They take four vehicles 
   into the desert (Bill says that they are doing this just in case one 
   of their vehicles gets destroyed by the enemy, not all of them will 
   die. Good thinking!) as they head to Major Schneider's compound and 
   almost immediately they are attacked by a cackling Captain Simpson, 
   who blows the hell out of Bill and his merc's four vehicles with a 
   tank, but leaves them all alive to die in the desert (We never see 
   Oliver Reed again. He probably did this cameo for some booze money.). 
   Luckily for Bill and his new friends, they noticed a plane a few 
   miles back and make a trek to it, where they discover it is owned by 
   a drug smuggler and when Bill tries to buy the plane (with more 
   counterfeit money!), a shootout occurs, where Bill and his gang kill 
   the drug smuggler and his gang. They also discover a satchel of 
   diamonds, and they divvy them up equally among each other (eight 
   diamonds each, each bundle worth about $500,000). They take off in 
   the plane en route to their destination, when their plane is shot 
   down by rebel leader Sekassi (Simon Sabela) and his band of rebels 
   (pretty good plane destruction scene for such a low budget affair). 
   Bill and his gang are taken prisoner, only to discover that Sekassi 
   is Bill's friend. Sekassi agrees to help Bill and his team attack 
   Major Schneider's compound, but they are lacking in weapons. Bill 
   unselfishly gives Sekassi his eight diamonds, which Sekassi says will 
   equip his band of rebels with all the weapons they need. Bill and his 
   mercs enter the compound under the guise of inspecting the compound 
   from the President of Angola's orders and at first their ruse works 
   and Bill finds his son naked and lying on the floor of a dirty, 
   hay-filled cell (Borgnine does a great acting job here when he looks 
   at the state of his son and tries to hide his emotions from the rest 
   of the group, but all of them feel for him.). As Bill rescues his 
   son, Sekassi and his rebels begin bombing the hell out of the 
   compound to cause a diversion, but Major Schneider captures Sam and 
   tells the rest of Bill's group to drop their weapons, which they do. 
   This is now where the group of merc's show off each of their 
   specialties, as Blade begins slicing and dicing the enemy, Toshiro 
   uses his martial arts training to beat the snot out of his opponents 
   and Bill and his gang pick up the guns and begin shooting, killing 
   Major Schneider (and picking up a briefcase), but not without some of 
   them getting shot in the process. Bill still uses his guise as an 
   Angolan official to get some of the enemy to help him move his son 
   and some of the injured mercs out of the compound! When Bill has no 
   way of making it back to civilization with his injured son, Sekassi 
   has one more trick up his sleeve: He gives Bill and his gang a 
   vintage 1930's Rolls Royce (!) so they can leave the country in style 
   and make it back to freedom. As they are traveling, Bill stops the 
   car to see what is in the briefcase. It is full of diamonds, millions 
   and millions of dollars worth and Bill wonders whether he should go 
   back to Sekassi and deliver them to him. The final shot shows him 
   saying &quot;What the hell!&quot; as he puts his hand in the mound of 
   diamonds and throws them up in the air, to the cheers of the mercs 
   and his son. That is where the film ends.&nbsp; While no big shakes 
   as an action film, you can't help but enjoy Ernest Borgnine (who was 
   70 at the time, but looked like he was in his late 40's), who is in 
   95% of the scenes of this film. And he looks like he is having the 
   time of his life, which translates well to the viewer's enjoyment of 
   the film. Director/actor John 'Bud&quot; Cardos (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#KingdomSpiders1977">KINGDOM

   - 1984) keeps things nice and loose and the chemistry between 
   Borgnine and his merc friends seems natural and not forced. There are 
   plenty of gunfights and explosions to keep most action films happy, 
   but if you are a fan of the late Ernest Borgnine (like I am), this 
   film is a must because it is one of his biggest roles in the latter 
   part of his career (when Bornine passed away at the age of 95, you 
   could swear that he was no older than 70) and he kills it here. He 
   has no problem blowing the bad guys away, while also showing sympathy 
   to his crew and his son (He keeps asking everyone if they are OK, 
   like he is father to them all). <B><A HREF="skeleton_coast_1987b.htm">SKELETON

   (1984) -</B> Peter &quot;Slash&quot; Harris (Romano Kristoff; <B><A HREF="#Ninja'sForce">NINJA'S

   his platoon from enemy gunfire. When The United States decides 
   they've had enough and decide to pull out of Vietnam, CIA agent Major 
   Andrew Scott (Mike Monty; <B><A HREF="#PhantomRaiders">PHANTOM RAIDERS</A></B> 
   - 1988) orders his second-in-command, Bruce Grant (Paul Vance; <B><A HREF="#NinjaWarriors">NINJA
    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1985), to destroy all the top secret documents 
   before he pulls out of Cambodia. As Bruce races to the office to 
   destroy the papers, he finds the safe empty and the documents 
   missing, as they were already taken by Major Scott and his assistant 
   Barbara (Gwenn Hung) a few minutes before he arrived. Major Scott and 
   Barbara flee in a Jeep with the papers with three MP bodyguards, but 
   they end up driving into the middle of a heated battle. Major Scott 
   is ejected from the Jeep before it explodes, killing the MPs and 
   Barbara ends up missing with the briefcase full of top-secret documen<A HREF="slash_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/slash 1984 dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>ts.
    Major Scott ends up in the hospital minus a leg, yet he still wants 
   to find Barbara and the documents. He hires old friend Slash to find 
   Barbara, but first Slash saves Major Scott from a kidnap attempt in 
   the hospital. Barbara, it turns out, is the wife of a Vietnamese 
   General (Patrick Lee), who knows that she and Major Scott are father 
   and daughter (Slash has not been made aware of this fact yet), so 
   Slash and his small group of commandos (which includes Filipino 
   staple Nick Nicholson) now have two reasons to bring Barbara back 
   alive. As Slash and his squad traverse the jungle, they stop a gang 
   rape of a village girl by a bunch of VC soldiers (which leads to a 
   nifty slow-motion bridge explosion) and then locate the enemy camp 
   where Barbara is being held (she's tied spread-eagle to some bamboo 
   poles). Slash saves her under the cover of darkness, but loses the 
   rest of his squad in the process, so now Slash and Barbara, who is in 
   a drugged-out stupor (&quot;I want morphine!&quot;), must locate the 
   hidden briefcase and make it to safety while a squad of enemy 
   soldiers dog their every move. Luckily, Slash has this incredible 
   weapon, that's one part radio, one part laser telescope and one part 
   rocket launcher, to keep the enemy at bay. With the briefcase in his 
   hands, Slash reunites Barbara with her father, but her dastardly 
   General husband has other plans. He takes all three of them captive 
   when the briefcase turns up empty. The finale reveals who the real 
   traitor is, yet Slash gives him a chance to decide the eventual 
   outcome. Heroes may shed no tears, but they still can act 
   humane.&nbsp; This Filipino war actioner, directed by Jun Gallardo (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Rescue Team">RESCUE

   - 1987) under the pseudonym &quot;John Gale&quot; and written by 
   co-star Paul Vance (as &quot;Paul Van&quot;) and Rod Davis, leaves a 
   lot of questions unanswered (The biggest one being: Why would Major 
   Scott tell Bruce to destroy the documents if he already knew that 
   Barbara was taking them out of the safe? It only makes sense if Major 
   Scott is a bad guy, but, as the film proves, he's not.), but it does 
   have some entertaining moments and violent scenes, especially Slash 
   destroying the enemy camp in the finale with his rocket launcher 
   thingamajig. There are a few &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moments, 
   such as when Slash sneaks into an enemy hospital to steal morphine 
   for Barbara's fix and ends up getting the hospital, doctors and 
   injured patients blown-up in the process. When he injects Barbara 
   with the morphine, she says to Slash, &quot;You got me just in 
   time!&quot; and proceeds to act like a non-junkie for the rest of the 
   film! The unbelievable ending, where Slash lets the traitorous Bruce 
   commit suicide after promising to destroy photos showing Bruce 
   screwing a whore (&quot;Think of the embarrassment it will cause my 
   family!&quot;), will have you shaking your head in disbelief. Bruce 
   acts more ashamed that he got caught with a whore than betraying an 
   entire nation! <B><A HREF="slash_1984b.htm">SLASH</A></B> is another

    As soon as they step off the plane, we can see that the bad guys 
   know they are there, because the plane explodes just after they 
   disembark (It looks as if they actually blew-up a jetliner. I know 
   that is not in the budget, but the explosion is spectacular!). 
   Leaving the airport in a taxi, Jo and Tom are shot at by two thugs 
   who are following them, Jo throwing a smoking cigar box (!) at their 
   car, forcing the bad guys to crash their car into a tree (Some fat 
   local on a bicycle taxi picks up the cigar box, smokes a lit 
   cigarette inside it and then tosses the box to the bad guys! Why? I 
   don't know, but it is sure as hell funny!). Jo, who is irresistable 
   to women (a running gag in the series), gets a phone call from an 
   unknown man, who tells him to hop on the next plane to New York City 
   and get out of Singapore, if he knows what's good for him, just 
   before an assassin takes a shot at him through his hotel room window. 
   Jo stops the bullet with his bulletproof briefcase and gets into a 
   fistfight with the assassin, killing him. Meanwhile, Tom goes water 
   skiing and he notices that the guy piloting the speed boat is trying 
   to kill him. Tom plays possum in the water and then beats up the guy, 
   asking him who sent him. Before he can get an answer, a sniper kills 
   the guy and we then find out that Tom has a gun hidden in his bathing 
   suit! (I would ask where he hid it, but I really don't want to 
   know!). We then discover that Apollo is actually Sybille (Barbara 
   Frey), the daughter of Professor Akron (E.F. F&uuml;rbringer; <B><A HREF="puzzle_of_the_red_orchid_1961.htm">THE

   &quot;filter&quot; that can turn a laser into a deadly weapon, able 
   to knock-out the electrical system of any plane in flight (Why would 
   a good scientist invent something like this? I guess so the bad guys 
   can try to steal it!). Sybille wants Jo and Tom to protect her father 
   and the filter until he unveils it at a conference later in the 
   month. Jo and Tom hop on a train to meet Sybille and fight a car full 
   of bad guys, easily winning. Sybille takes them to meet her father, 
   where we find out that the professor's near-deaf servant, Lapore (M.

   Professor's home.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The head of the criminal organization, Li Hu Wang (Nikola Popovic), 
   orders his best assassin, Stella (Gisela Hahn; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Contamination1980">CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   - 1980), to kill Lapore (He's afraid Lapore will talk, but how can he 
   talk when he is stone-cold deaf??? What could he have possibly 
   heard?) and steal the filter, killing anyone who stands in her way. 
   Jo and Tom learn of Lapore's treachery and chase him through the 
   streets of Singapore. Lapore thinks he has gotten away, but Stella 
   sees him and says, &quot;Pray Lapore!&quot;, before killing him with 
   a speargun bolt to his back. Jo and Tom chase Stella and she 
   disappears into a tour group. Jo meets another female assassin called 
   Selena (Margaret Rose Keil;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BigBustOut">THE

   instantly falls in love with him, but Jo tells her he is too busy to 
   pay attention to her and that he will see her later (He usually finds 
   time for the ladies!). Sybille drives Tom And Jo back to their hotel, 
   so they can get their bags, but she is kidnapped by two male goons on 
   Li Hu Wang's payroll. Wang calls up Professor Akron, telling him that 
   if he wants his daughter back alive, he better hand off the filter to 
   him. Jo and Tom, unaware on what is going on, meet Selena and another 
   woman in the hotel lounge, where they dance the frug (!). Selena 
   tells Jo that she is going to avenge the death of her fiance, who was 
   murdered by Li Hu Wang, but she dies in Jo's arms, the apparent 
   victim of a poisoning. A local police inspector tells Jo not to leave 
   the hotel until he can get to the bottom of Selena's death.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Professor phones Jo, telling him that Sybille was kidnapped. Jo 
   tells the Professor not to hand over the filter, as he will rescue 
   his daughter (Jo always gets his woman!). Jo then goes undercover as 
   &quot;Mr. Hamilton&quot;, a seller of a large quantities of bananas 
   (!) and goes to Li Hu Wang's headquarters, which is also the base of 
   operations of his criminal empire. Jo and Tom fall victim to one of 
   Wang's booby traps, where they fall though a trap door and an 
   elevator descends, threatening to crush them. The quick-tinking Jo 
   saves both their hides (He hops inside the elevator, saying 
   &quot;Going up!&quot;). Tom hears the words &quot;Golden Dragon&quot; 
   being spoken and Jo knows where they have to go. They escape Wang's 
   hideout and another attempt on their lives by Stella and head to a 
   transport ship called &quot;The Golden Dragon&quot;, but Wang's thugs 
   and Stella are waiting for them. Another fistfight erupts (Brad 
   Harris was fight and action choreographer on all the films in the 
   series) and Jo rescues Sybille, but the pier catches on fire. Jo 
   grabs a high-pressure fire hose and foils Stella and the thugs 
   attempt on their lives. Jo, Tom and Sybille then go to the 
   Professor's house, but he's not there, he went to Wang to turn over 
   the filter. Wang has Stella shot dead for not stopping Jo and Tom and 
   our duo head to Wang's hideout for a final confrontation. How do you

   effect (rather than using stock footage, Parolini puts the actors in 
   the middle of the travelogue footage, giving the film a skewered

   this film a couple of notches above most Eurospy fare. Brad Harris 
   has precious little to do here, besides fighting, water skiing and 
   looking puzzled at Jo's actions. They do make a good team, if only in 
   the way they play off each other. It seems natural, not forced. Case

   from Jo, which is set to explode. When Tom finally gets the case and 
   throws it away, Jo refuses to believe him, even when the case 
   eventually explodes. Instead of apologising to Tom, Jo hops on a

   that Jo will eventually return for him. That is what makes this

   - 2007) lost his son Kevin when he was shot down while flying a 
   mission over Vietnam in 1965. Pendleton never gave up hope that his 
   son is still alive, so he hires a guy named Sid Friedkin (Michael 
   Vlastas) to train a bunch of mercenaries on his Hawaiian estate to 
   rescue his son if he is still alive (they stage a phony raid on a 
   fake POW camp, using illegal immigrants as the VC and firing live 
   rounds, killing them all!). To milk even more money out of Pendleton, 
   conniving Friedman hires junkie Jeffrey Stokes (Derek Williams) to 
   pretend to be a rescued POW (he is actually an Army deserter) that 
   spent time in the same prison camp as Kevin, falsely verifying to 
   Pendleton that his son is still alive. Pendleton falls for the ruse

   is heading to Hawaii after getting a frantic phone call from Jeffrey, 
   who everyone thought died in Vietnam. Spyder catches up with his 
   partner at the airport, but Lee tells him to mind his own business. 
   We know that's not gonna happen. Jeffrey is being hunted down by 
   Friedkin's head goon Ed Skinner (Gary Rooney), who kills both Jeffrey 
   and Lee in a hotel room shootout and plants half a kilo of heroin in 
   Lee's room to make it look like a drug deal gone wrong. Of course, 
   Spyder doesn't buy it and heads to Hawaii, where he has to deal with 
   hard-ass Police Chief Bill Akida (a badly-dubbed Vic Diaz), who makes 
   Spyder's investigation more difficult than it has to be. Friendly 
   uniform cop Ted Kanaka (Henry Strzalkowski) helps Spyder in his

   Del Castillo), who informs Spyder (after some &quot;friendly&quot;

   confronts Pendleton and his daughter Karen (Roxanne Baird) and learns 
   to whole sordid story about Kevin. As Spyder starts piecing the 
   puzzle together, attempts are made on his life (Kanaka is killed by a 
   bomb planted in Spyder's hotel room) and he is nearly killed by 
   Skinner. Spyder joins forces with Karen when her father is kidnapped 
   by Friedkin and Skinner and held for $5 million in ransom. In the 
   finale, Spyder and Skinner have a bare-knuckle fight to the death, 
   while Friedkin shoots it out with the cops after callously killing 
   Karen. With nothing left to live for, Pendleton flies a helicopter 
   into a building, killing Friedkin and putting an end to this whole 
   sordid affair.&nbsp; This is a fast-paced, but horrifically acted,

   Australian cop Joseph Stoner (George Lazenby; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ManFromHongKong">THE
    MAN FROM HONG KONG</A></B> - 1975) is looking for his girlfriend 
   Melanie and when he finds her at Rupert's commune, she looks just 
   like a heroin junkie and all she can say is, &quot;I want...more men! 
   I want...happiness!&quot; (she dies a short time later). Stoner beats 
   the crap out of Rupert to find the source of the Happy Pills and it 
   leads him to a shopkeeper named Chu, whom he finds dead with a knife 
   in his stomach, but Stoner finds an important clue in Chu's clenched 
   fist. As he is leaving the shop, Stoner is attacked by some masked 
   Chinese gang members, whom he easily defeats. Stoner, who majored in 
   Chinese philosophy in college and speaks Chinese (even though it's 
   easy to hear that someone else dubs him when he speaks Chinese), 
   heads to Hong Kong to get some payback. He is followed closely by two 
   of Mr. Chin's employees, Agnes Wong (Betty Ting Pei) and Chen (Hong 
   Kong superstar Sammo Hung, who looks impossibly young here), a man 
   with a huge black mole on his face. Agnes has Chen and a bunch of 
   goons beat-up Stoner and she brings him to her apartment under the 
   guise that she is a concerned new friend. Actually, Agnes is Mr. 
   Chin's main squeeze, and she keeps close tabs on Stoner, but when he 
   joins forces with undercover cop Angela (who has been pretending to 
   be a peasant girl while watching the ship), they infiltrate Mr. 
   Chin's underground compound to end the Happy Pill menace.&nbsp;

   martial arts fights, especially in the fully uncut version (American 
   audiences had to make do with an R-Rated <A HREF="stoner_1974b.htm">VHS
    edition released by Harmony Vision</A>, that was shorn of nearly 25 
   minutes of footage!). Some of that weirdness includes the cult orgy 
   scene (plenty of female nudity) and the realization that Mr. Chin is 
   keeping everyone in his hometown hooked on Happy Pills by spiking 
   their daily communal &quot;soft Drink&quot; ceremony at the temple! 
   Mr. Chin's laboratory and office on the cargo ship is a delightful 
   mixture of lounge motifs (his desk rotates in a circle and becomes a 
   martial arts set piece during the finale) and sci-fi trappings. Mr. 
   Lazenby acquits himself nicely in his fight scenes and it's plain to 
   see he used no stunt doubles (he has a nice one-on-one with Sammo 
   Hung that is well choreographed and keeps both of their faces on 
   screen at all times), especially in the sequence where he and Angela 
   Mao are trapped in a cage while Mr. Chin's minions try to stab them 
   with spears. Lazenby also has a freakout scene where he is injected 
   with the Happy Pill and tries to rape Angela, but she knocks him out 
   before he can go through with it (I love the way he hides his 
   erection by cupping his hands over the groin area of his pants!). He 
   even shaves his moustache off so no one will recognize him! Lazenby 
   gets plenty of bad press in some critical circles, but I have always 
   found him to be an above-average action star and a more than adequate 
   actor. Watch <B><A HREF="stoner_1974b.htm">STONER</A></B> yourself 
   and make up your own mind. Also dig the funky music score. The first 
   few bars of the theme music sounds exactly like The Edgar Winter

    ROCK</A><A NAME="StuntRock"></A> (1978) -</B> This film has a minor 
   cult following and it's easy to see why. The fictional story is about 
   Australian stuntman Grant Page (playing himself) traveling to 
   Hollywood to handle the stunts for the new TV series &quot;Undercover 
   Girl&quot;, starring Monique Van De Ven (playing herself) as the 
   title character. Grant hooks up with his cousin, who is a member of a 
   rock band called Sorcery (playing themselves) and tours the streets 
   of Hollywood, taking a stroll on the Walk of Fame while we see 
   theater marquees in the background (one of them is showing <B><A HREF="deep_throat_1972.htm">DEEP
    THROAT</A></B>). Sorcery uses real &quot;magic&quot; onstage with 
   their music and their entire stage show is a rock opera that tells 
   the story about a duel between the King of the Wizards (Paul Haynes) 
   and the Prince of Darkness (Curtis Hyde). While on his way to a stunt 
   shoot on the new TV series, Grant meets magazine reporter Lois Wells 
   (Margaret Gerard, who previously appeared with Grant Page in <B><A HREF="#DeathCheaters">DEATH
    CHEATERS</A></B> - 1976), who is on assignment covering a story 
   about why people find danger so exciting, so Grant is a perfect 
   specimen for her article. Grant performs some dangerous stunts on the 
   set of Undercover Girl (the director keeps screaming for more blood!) 
   and later on Grant, Lois and Monique (who wants Grant to help her 
   perform her own stunts) go and watch Sorc<A HREF="stunt_rock_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/stunt rock poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ery
    rehearse in the studio and then to an actual stage performance, 
   where the band uses fire gags, sleight-of-hand and some pretty 
   awesome prog-rock tunes to tell their story about good versus evil. 
   That's about the entire plot of the film, as Grant performs a series 
   of dangerous stunts (along with footage of other stunt men and women) 
   and Sorcery performs a series of original tunes and magic to an 
   appreciative audience. A small sub-plot involves Grant trying to woo 
   Lois, who wants nothing to do with stuntmen (he climbs a wire thirty 
   stories in the air without a harness by Lois' apartment window, just 
   so he can invite her to a pool party!) and Monique's unflinching need 
   to perform her own stunts, much to the chagrin of her agent (we 
   actually see her rappel down the side of a building on a rope 
   harness). Grant then performs a stunt at Sorcery's stage show and 
   they dedicate their song &quot;Stunt Rocker&quot; to him. The 
   End.&nbsp; Director Brian Trenchard-Smith treads a fine line between 
   fiction and reality and, by all accounts, he should have failed 
   miserably. Surprisingly, though, this film is a total blast from 
   beginning to end, thanks in no small part to Grant Page's on-screen 
   charisma and devil-may-care stuntwork and Sorcery's kick-ass music 
   and stage show. Page (a world-class stuntman and stunt coordinator), 
   who worked with director Trenchard-Smith previously on <B><A HREF="action.htm#ManFromHongKong">THE
    MAN FROM HONG KONG</A></B> (1975) and the stunt-filled <B><A HREF="#DeathCheaters">DEATH
    CHEATERS</A></B> (1976), is seen performing every type of stunt 
   imaginable, from high falls, car crashes, fire gags and getting hit 
   by a speeding car. There's even some real-life documentary footage of 
   Grant getting seriously injured performing stunts (he broke a few 
   bones when getting hit by the speeding car). But none of this would 
   have mattered if it didn't gel with the concert footage. Luckily, 
   Trenchard-Smith chose Sorcery, a big-haired prog-rock band (the 
   keyboard player wears a hood over his head and his voice is 
   electronically altered) with a loyal cult following (they still 
   perform as of this review). I must confess that I never heard of them 
   or their music before this film, but their songs and stage show won 
   me over pretty quickly. They are kind of like Emerson, Lake and 
   Palmer mixed with an Arthurian Legend stage show, complete with a 
   Merlin-like wizard (who at one point is spun on the tip of a sword 
   and then impaled!) that performs many magic tricks. It's like 
   watching a David Henning magic show with fist-pumping rock music, but 
   without the extreme overbite. There's not very much meat to the plot 
   (the script was written by Trenchard-Smith and Paulmichel Mielche 
   Jr.), but who cares? It's a feast for the eyes and the ears. At one 
   point, Grant Page does chin-ups on top of the giant &quot;H&quot; of 
   the Hollywood sign! Good stuff. There's also a clip from <B><A HREF="gone_in_60_seconds_1974.htm">GONE
    IN 60 SECONDS</A></B> (1974) and the credited Stunt Coordinator is 
   Tony Cecere (who did the long fire gag in <B><A HREF="swamp_thing_1982.htm">SWAMP
    THING</A></B> [1982]), but that's probably because union rules 
   dictate that the stunts filmed in the U.S. must have an American 
   stunt coordinator. Also starring Dick Blackburn, Ron Raley and Chris 
   Chalen, who does a Houdini escape trick at the bottom of a pool. The

   the son of a Milan crime boss, is in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with a motorcycle-riding Rambo returning to his 
   brother's place in Milan after being in self-imposed exile in 
   Hamburg, Germany for a couple of years. His brother, Pino (Mario 
   Piave; Lenzi's <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST HUMAN</A></B> 
   - 1974), is happy to see him, as is Pino's wife, Maria (Maria Fiore), 
   and their young son Luigino (Duilio Cruciani; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DontTortureDuck72">DON'T
    TORTURE A DUCKLING</A></B> - 1972). It is obvious Luigino idolizes 
   Rambo and they have a very funny banter with each other (One of 
   Rambo's jokes to Luigino: &quot;What's round and red and rides a big 
   mare? The Lone Orange.&quot; Huh? Since when is an orange red???). 
   Pino works for an &quot;organized private police force&quot; and 
   wants Rambo to join him (Rambo calls him a &quot;night watchman&quot;,
    which Pino doesn't find funny). Milan is full of crime, including 
   robberies and kidnappings (a big problem in Italy at the time; read 
   my review of <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP SYNDICATE</A></B> 
   [1975] to see how Italy combatted kidnappings), so Pino tells Rambo 
   it's a perfect job for him, just like being a cop, only the pay is 
   much better. Rambo is not interested (telling his brother he has 
   learned to mind his own business and as long as no one bothers him, 
   he will not bother anyone else), but Pino convinces him to visit his 
   headquarters tomorrow morning. The next day, Rambo shows up at the 
   headquarters, where he meets Pino's boss, Commandante Ferrari (cameo 
   king Tom Felleghy; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Blood&amp;Diamonds1977">BLOOD
    AND DIAMONDS</A></B> - 1977) and watches members of this private 
   police force train in a karate class. Rambo joins in, kicking the 
   crap out of everyone, including his brother. He then shows his 
   mastery with a pistol at their target range, Impressing Ferrari, who 
   invites him to join their team. Rambo still says that he is not 
   interested, but his brother tells his boss that Rambo will be riding 
   shotgun with him on his next assignment tomorrow. We then see some 
   men, who are members of a crime syndicate run by Conti (Luciano 
   Catenacci; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ShortNightDolls1971">SHORT 
   NIGHT OF GLASS DOLLS</A></B> - 1971), kidnap a young boy named 
   Gianpiero (Alessandro Cocco), the son of rich Dr. Marco Marsili 
   (Silvano Tranquilli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SmileBeforeDeath72">SMILE
    BEFORE DEATH</A></B> - 1972) and his famous actress wife (Evelyn 
   Stewart; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE PSYCHIC</A></B> - 
   1977), who doesn't want the police involved because, whenever they 
   are, the kidnapee usually ends up dead. Dr. and Mrs. Marsili will pay 
   anything to get their son back alive and they are willing to do it 
   without any police intervention, even though one police detective 
   (Gianni De Benedetto; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE
    EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974) is working in the 
   background, collecting evidence on the kidnappers.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Rambo riding shotgun with his brother on a truck whose 
   firm is experiencing hijackings, so they hired Pino's firm to catch 
   the hijackers, who work for Conti's syndicate. A car containing two 
   of Conti's men pulls alongside the truck and tosses a Molotov 
   cocktail at it, setting the truck on fire. Luckily, Rambo has his 
   motorcycle in the back of the truck and gives chase to the car, 
   forcing it off the road into a field, where it rolls and explodes, 
   but Rambo &quot;arrests&quot; the two men, turning them over to Pino. 
   Rambo also reconnects with his old flame, Flora (Femi Benussi; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StripNudeKiller">STRIP
    NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER</A></B> - 1975), whom he meets at his old 
   hangout, The Billiard Saloon (the owner of the saloon, Pops, is 
   portrayed by Guido Alberti; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   - 1974), and he shacks up with her while he is in Milan. Pino phones 
   Rambo at the saloon, telling him that he discovered where Conti is 
   holding Gianpiero and he wants Rambo to help him rescue the boy. 
   Rambo tells his brother to tell the police and keep out of it, but 
   his brother hangs up the phone. Pino never gets a chance to rescue 
   the boy, as two of Conti's men, murder him by running him off the 
   road and bashing his head against a boulder repeatedly. Big mistake. 
   Now Rambo is personally involved and nothing will stop him from 
   getting revenge.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rambo discovers that Philip Duval (Antonio Casale; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Autopsy1973">AUTOPSY</A></B> 
   - 1973) is the man who murdered his brother, so he goes to Duval's 
   place and begins to choke the life out of him, demanding to know 
   where Gianpiero is being held. Duval gives him the address of a 
   warehouse and Rambo is forced to shoot and kill him when he reaches 
   for a gun (Rambo has explosive dum-dum bullets in his pistol, which 
   are illegal, but leave a nice big hole in their target). Rambo then 
   goes to elderly crime syndicate boss Paterno (Joseph Cotten; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY
    FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971), an old &quot;friend&quot; of Rambo's 
   (he's the man that got Rambo kicked off the force) and Conti's main 
   adversary, and makes a deal with him to rescue Gianpiero for a cut of 
   the two billion lire ransom demand Conti has given Dr. Marsili for 
   the safe return of his son. Rambo knows the police won't be involved, 
   so it's a win-win situation for the both of them. Paterno agrees and 
   sends his son, Ciccio (Adolfo Lastretti; <B><A HREF="deaf_smith_and_johnny_ears_1972.htm">DEAF
    SMITH AND JOHNNY EARS</A></B> - 1973) and Ciccio's right-hand man 
   Franco (Mario Novelli; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Eyes Behind Stars">EYES
    BEHIND THE STARS</A></B> - 1977) to accompany Rambo on this rescue 
   mission (Right away we can see that Franco means more to Ciccio than 
   just a right-hand man, if you know what I mean). Rambo goes to the 
   warehouse and demands to talk to Conti (one of Conti's men is 
   portrayed by our old friend &quot;Alan Collins&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SevenDeathsCatsEyes">SEVEN
    DEATHS IN THE CAT'S EYE</A></B> - 1973; who uses his real name, 
   Luciano Pigozzi, here). While Rambo is talking to Conti, Ciccio, 
   Franco and some of their men, who are dressed as police, raid the 
   warehouse and a large gunfight breaks out, giving Rambo time to find 
   and free Gianpiero, but before he can get him out of the warehouse, 
   Conti confronts them and threatens to kill Gianpiero if he doesn't 
   hand him over. Rambo has no other choice but to do so, but he 
   promises a scared Gianpiero that he will return and free him, jumping 
   out a window before Conti can shoot him. Rambo still gets his payment 
   from Paterno (he may be a crime boss, but he's a man of his word), 
   which he hands over to Maria and promises to buy Luigino a motorcycle 
   just like his, only smaller. He tells Maria if she needs to talk to 
   him to phone the Billiard Saloon and leave a message with Pops, he 
   stops there several times a day.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see some of Conti's thugs raid one of Paterno's gambling 
   parlors, murdering some employees and destroying the joint. Paterno 
   tells Ciccio to get even with Conti, so he and Franco stop a car 
   containing a few kilos of Conti's heroin, ripping up the bags and 
   scattering the heroin in the wind and then making the driver swallow 
   an open bag of the drug, killing him. Flora tells Rambo that he must 
   be stirring up the shit, because some thugs grabbed her at the saloon 
   and wanted to know where he was staying, but she didn't say anything. 
   Since criminals can't be trusted, Paterno and Conti form a truce and 
   agree to kill Rambo because he is bad for both their criminal 
   empires. Ciccio and Franco show up at Flora's place and when she 
   won't tell them where Rambo is, Ciccio kicks her in the face, killing 
   her. The nameless owner of the Billiard Saloon tells Rambo that Maria 
   just called and she sounds worried, so when he calls her back, she 
   tells them that Luigino has been kidnapped, but we then see that 
   Ciccio and Franco are holding a gun to the boy and making Maria lie 
   to Rambo. Rambo smells something fishy, but he goes to Maria's place 
   anyway, only for Ciccio to shoot him three times and then leave, but 
   we then discover that Rambo was wearing a bulletproof vest, much to 
   Maria and Luigino's relief. Now everyone thinks Rambo is dead and no 
   longer a problem, but when he finds out Flora was murdered, all bets 
   are off, as Rambo begins to kill everyone involved in Gianpiero's 
   kidnapping and Flora's murder. Crime never had it so bad.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What I really liked about this film is that Rambo isn't perfect and 
   makes some questionable decisions, such as letting Gianpiero play an 
   important part of his rescue, putting the young boy in further danger 
   and nearly getting him killed in the process. The film also has some 
   choice dialogue, such as when Rambo holds a gun to Conti's head and 
   says, &quot;Listen, Conti. Life is just one hole. You start from a 
   hole, you feed yourself through a hole, you shit from a hole and you 
   finish up in a hole. And the one in this barrel can put you in that 
   last hole.&quot; I never thought about life that way, but truer words 
   were never spoken. Tomas Milian is his usual marvelous self as Rambo. 
   Any film he's in improves exponentially just by his presence. How his 
   character was named Rambo is also interesting. It seems he read David 
   Morrell's novel &quot;First Blood&quot; while waiting for a plane and 
   liked it so much that he tried to get some Italian producers to make 
   it into a film starring him as John Rambo. They all turned him down, 
   so he used the name as his character in the next film he appeared in, 
   which was this film. My mind still boggles at the thought of Milian 
   portraying John Rambo. The producers blew their chance of making a 
   shitload of money, but when Sylvester Stallone's <B><A HREF="first_blood_1982.htm">FIRST
    BLOOD</A></B> (1982) became a smash boxoffice hit, Luciano Martino, 
   this film's producer, renamed this film <B><A HREF="rambos_revenge_1975.htm">RAMBO'S
    REVENGE</A></B> to cash-in on that film's success! It's an apt title 
   for this film, but highly misleading. Another very interesting aspect 
   about this film is Ciccio's relationship with Franco. It becomes 
   apparent after a short while that Ciccio needs Franco's approval on 
   everything he does, ending every sentence with &quot;Right, 
   Franco?&quot; Homosexuality was frowned upon in the poliziotteschi 
   genre (for further proof, read my review for <B><A HREF="action.htm#LiveLikeA Cop">LIVE
    LIKE A COP</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="action.htm#LiveLikeA Cop">,</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="action.htm#LiveLikeA Cop"> 
   DIE LIKE A MAN</A></B> - 1976), but filmmakers found a way around it, 
   using dialogue and certain looks to convey man's fellow sexual 
   admiration for their fellow man. Just listen to Ciccio's cries when 
   he sees Rambo gun Franco down and you'll see and hear what I mean. 
   Joseph Cotten is also good as an aging gangster whose only hope<A HREF="rambos_revenge_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/rambo's revenge dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   is that his son will take over his criminal empire. He is also hiding 
   a secret only Rambo knows about; a secret that would get the elderly 
   gangster killed if his adversaries ever found out about it. What he 
   does when he discovers Ciccio is dead will touch you to your core. 
   Yes, I liked this movie, warts and all; the biggest wart being that 
   Rambo is supposed to be an excellent motorcycle rider, but Milian 
   looks so uncomfortable behind the handlebars, it's hard to believe he 
   rides one at all, which explains why he wears a red scarf around his 
   face whenever he rides one, so as to not see the stunt rider's face

   crusader Professor Green with guns blazing, killing the Professor and

   police inspector Michael Baiko (Alphonse Beni; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#NinjaSilentAssassin">NINJA:

   Baiko wants to cancel the Pope's visit, but his superiors refuse, 
   saying it will ruin Cameroon's image if they do so. Baiko 
   interrogates a captured terrorist (The terrorist says, &quot;I want a 
   cigarette&quot; to which Baiko replies, &quot;You'll get a cigarette 
   up your ass!&quot;), but when he removes the terrorist's handcuffs on 
   superiors' orders, the terrorist commits suicide by jumping out of a 
   conveniently opened window. Inspector Baiko flies to Rome to 
   personally try to stop the Pope's visit, but the Pope's people also 
   turn him down. While in Rome, Baiko meets Secret Service agent

    wearing a black leather trench coat with a matching black fedora), 
   who wants to work with him in capturing Zero, but Baiko turns him 
   down (Matthew's reply is a curt &quot;Fuck you!&quot;). Baiko enlists 
   the help of elderly Italian boxer friend Killer Milian (Lorenzo 
   Piani) and the pair begin tearing-up Rome looking for clues, with 
   Matthews clandestinely shadowing them. It's a good thing he does, 
   because Baiko is captured by some Italian thugs, hung upside down and 
   nearly dismembered with an electric chainsaw before Matthews saves 
   him with some well-placed shotgun blasts. From that moment on, Baiko 
   and Matthews are a team, although they really don't trust each other 
   that much. They begin busting heads in their search for Zero and 
   learn that the terrorist organization plan on murdering Andrew 
   Milhenge (Gordon Mitchell; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B>

   Unfortunately, they are too late (Milhenge has his brains blown out 
   in bloody close-up), but they duo do manage to injure and capture 
   Zero's girlfriend, Olga (Ninette Assor). They stake out the hospital 
   where Olga is recuperating in hopes of catching Zero making an 
   unscheduled visit, but Zero manages to sneak in disguised as a doctor 
   and kills Olga to stop her from talking. Baiko and Matthews then head 
   back to Cameroon, where Zero kidnaps Baiko's young daughter. How will 
   Baiko and Matthews handle this situation? Will they let Zero (who 
   suffers from bouts of uncontrollable seizures throughout the film) 
   kill the Pope to save Baiko's daughter? Don't count on it!&nbsp; This 
   is one of the most preposterously entertaining Italian action films 
   that I have witnessed in quite some time. Director Richard Harrison,

    FORCE COMMANDO</A></B> (filmed under the title <B>THREE MEN ON FIRE</B>)
    is full of bloody action set-pieces with lots of car crashes, 
   shoot-outs and bullet squibs. It also has some very unintentially 
   funny dialogue (script by Harrison and co-star Romano Kristoff) and 
   some &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; scenes, such as when Matthews and 
   Baiko are reading newspapers in a park looking for clues and a 
   child's red rubber kickball interrupts Matthews' train of thought. He 
   gets up, grabs the ball out of the kid's hands, kicks the ball over 
   the hedges and then threatens the kid's father with his gun when he 
   tries to intervene! The only purpose for this scene is to show how 
   much Matthews hates children! It has nothing to do with the rest of 
   the film. There's also a scene towards the finale where a wigged-out 
   Zero delivers a cringe-worthy monologue about his whore mother 
   abandoning him as a child while he's groping Baiko's gagged daughter 
   (&quot;There's so much evil in the world!&quot;). It's uncomfortable 
   to watch, but oddly compelling at the same time. I guess that's the 
   best way to describe this film on a whole: It's unpolished, but it's 
   still a diamond-in-the-rough. This is not Alphonse Beni's (who 
   Produced this along with Harrison) first time portraying Inspector 
   Michael Baiko. He originated the role in <B><A HREF="cameroon_connection_1985.htm">CAMEROON

    INSANE</A></B> (1975) and many others. Just like those films, <B>THE TERRORISTS</B> 
   contains god-awful acting, terrible photography, bad sound recording, 
   editing that looks to have been done by someone having an epileptic 
   fit and a minimal, droning music score (it's nothing but someone 
   tapping on a drum in military cadence). In other words, this is a 
   film that demands to be seen by every badfilm fanatic. The film opens 
   with a terrorist in a car holding a sawed-off shotgun killing an 
   American soldier who is guarding the front of McGraw Army Base in 
   Munich, Germany. We learn from a German newswoman, Andrea Hueller 
   (Irmgard Millard, Nick Millard's wife, who is so flat and lifeless in 
   her line delivery, I half-expected an ambulance to show up and take 
   her pulse), that a terrorist organization called The Peoples War has 
   claimed responsibility for the murder. Since the murdered soldier's 
   father is an American bigshot, the military assigns Captain James 
   Luke (Marland Proctor), a CIA spook with a short fuse who gets 
   results quickly, to investigate the soldier's death. The German po<A HREF="terrorists_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terrorists 1978 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>lice
    assign Inspector Paul Steger (Hans Grabinger) to investigate the 
   case and, as he knocks on doors looking for witnesses, he gets into a 
   shootout with a bank robber who is hiding out in an apartment. After 
   one of the funniest gun battles in recent memory (actually, one of 
   two in this film!), Inspector Steger kills the bank robber. We then 
   learn, just like James, that Steger is a loose cannon, this being his 
   third killing this year alone. James (who, thanks to a drug bust gone 
   bad, has his left arm in a sling throughout all of the film) gets an 
   important clue from Soviet friend Sergei Goncharov (Ray Miles). James 
   then gets into a shootout with two of the terrorists (where he must 
   fire at least thirty shots without reloading his revolver!), killing 
   them both. James is next on the terrorist's hit list, thanks to his 
   latest antics, yet he finds time to romance Andrea! James and Paul 
   join forces when Sergei is shot in the back by the terrorists, led by 
   someone known as The Professor (who is a college professor!). Can 
   they stop the terrorists before they assassinate President Carter, 
   who is visiting Munich in a couple of days?&nbsp; Like most of 
   Millard's films, this is less than sixty minutes in length but seems 
   four times as long. Like <B>.357 MAGNUM</B>, Millard (who uses the 
   pseudonym &quot;Jan Anders&quot; as the director credit and 
   &quot;Gunnel Kjellin&quot; for the screenwriting credit) always aims 
   his camera way too high, almost always cutting off the lower jaw of 
   people's faces in the close-up and framing the other shots way north 
   of the Equator. The film is so cheap, rather than show a bomb 
   explosion planted by the terrorists, we only hear about it from the 
   lethargic newswoman Andrea during one of her many on-camera reports. 
   Some of the dialogue is absolutely surreal, such as when James 
   questions the dead soldier's personal life by asking the Army base 
   commander, &quot;What about drug use or homosexuality?&quot; (As if 
   being high on drugs or being gay was a reasonable excuse for being 
   gunned down!). Here's my favorite piece of dialogue between Paul and 
   James: <B>Paul:</B> &quot;My girlfriend left me today for a 
   wo-man.&quot; <B>James:</B> &quot;A what?&quot; <B>Paul:</B> &quot;A 
   funny one.&quot; <B>James:</B> &quot;You mean a fruit?&quot; <B>Paul:</B> 
   &quot;Yes.&quot; <B>James:</B> &quot;It sounds to me like she may 
   have a few problems.&quot; Simply precious. The gunfight between 
   James and the two terrorists is something that was spoofed in <B><A HREF="naked_gun_1988.htm">THE
    NAKED GUN</A></B> (1988). Besides defying all bullet-loading logic, 
   they are no more than three feet away from each other as they are 
   shooting it out! The quick, chainsaw editing only adds to the 
   confusion, as the camera manages to always be in the wrong place at 
   the wrong time. Millard also pads out the film's short running time 
   with an out of place, nearly hardcore, insert of a stripper cutting a 
   hole in her panties with scissors, exposing her pubic hair, and then 
   gyrating for the camera while she squats over some soda bottles (!), 
   as a bad saxophone solo plays in the background. <B>THE TERRORISTS</B> 
   is as bad as they come, but all it's inadequacies adds-up to maximum 
   enjoyment for lovers of rightfully obscure cinema. Although this film 
   was made between 1978 - 1980, it was not released on VHS until the 
   mid-to-late 80's (James remarks about the &quot;tragedy in Dallas 
   fifteen years ago&quot;, yet on Paul's gravestone, it lists 1980 as 
   the year of his death. Either Millard is bad at math [Kennedy was 
   shot in 1963] or it took him two years to complete this.). Also

   time when terrorist groups are hijacking planes and blowing up 
   buildings around the world, a group of crooks pretend to be 
   terrorists to pull off a bank robbery. Little do the crooks know that 
   a world-renown terrorist named Gozal (El Manik; <B><A HREF="hell_raiders_1985.htm">HELL
    RAIDERS</A></B> - 1985) was hired to head the robbery team by a 
   crooked hospital executive named Mr. Santos, who needs the money to 
   save his floundering hospital. Gozal recruits professional crook John 
   (Advent Bangun; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#BlindWarrior">THE BLIND WARRIOR</A></B> 
   - 1987) to help him pull off the robbery and he agrees to do it as 
   long as politics aren't involved, but as he will soon find out, 
   politics is the least of his problems. When the crooks try to enter 
   the bank and the newly installed bomb detector goes off, it leads to 
   a lengthy (and hilariously inept) car chase, where the crooks destroy 
   their car, steal a truck and crash it into the front of a hospital.

    it is? Yep, it's Mr. Santos' hospital and soon Gozal uses the time 
   bombs in his possession to hold the hospital and it's occupants' 
   hostage as the police surround the hospital and SWAT helicopters 
   hover overhead. The first thing Gozal does is kill Mr. Santos to keep 
   him from talking and he then plants the bombs around the hospital, 
   setting them to go off at 7:00 PM. The police call in a SWAT team 
   Captain (Barry Prima; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Warrior1981">THE WARRIOR</A></B> 
   - 1981) to kill the &quot;terrorists&quot; and he does just that, 
   killing every one of them (including John) except Gozal, who escapes 
   through the stairwell after setting off a bomb, engulfing the 
   hospital in flames (you gotta see it to believe it) and trapping many 
   innocent people, including infirmed patients, inside. Gozal, who has 
   now gone completely bonkers, roams the hospital's smoke-filled 
   corridors firing his weapons aimlessly and shouting &quot;You're all 
   gonna die!&quot; while the fire department and police try to rescue 
   people in the hospital. Gozal grabs a newborn baby, goes to the 
   hospital's roof and demands a helicopter picks him up or he will kill 
   the baby. Instead, the police helicopter-in Gozal's wife and young 
   son to the roof in a rope net (!) to distract Gozal long enough so 
   that the SWAT Captain can shoot him (and an innocent doctor!) dead in 
   front of his family. Un-fucking-believable!&nbsp; Where do I begin to 
   describe how badly entertaining this no-budget actioner really is? 
   It's a cross between <B><A HREF="die_hard_1988.htm">DIE HARD</A></B> 
   (1988) and <B><A HREF="hard_boiled_1993.htm">HARD BOILED</A></B> 
   (1993), but made years before anyone even heard of those two films. 
   All the explosions are done with miniature model buildings that are 
   so bad, they make the structures stomped on by Godzilla in the 60's 
   look highly detailed. Clearly, 80% of the film was shot using 
   out-of-focus rear-projected backgrounds, most of it so ineptly 
   obvious, especially the car/truck chase, that I nearly peed my pants 
   from laughing so hard. The entire hospital sequence is so chintzy in 
   it's execution, it takes on an otherworldly quality.

   scene to the next (including a hilarious encounter with a bomb maker 
   who secretly poisons the entire robbery team until they pay him!), 
   culminating in one of the most unbelievable (not to mention unlawful) 
   endings I have ever witnessed. What law agency in their right mind 
   would ever put a terrorist's wife and kid in a rope net and hover 
   them over the roof of a burning hospital so they can try and talk him 
   into giving up? Add to that constant scenes of people getting shot 
   (lots of bloody bullet squibs), running around on fire, jumping off 
   the hospital roof and hitting the ground (more rear projection work 
   that elicits laughs rather than gasps) and a police force more 
   concerned about killing bad guys than saving innocent lives (the cops 
   end up killing more innocents than the bad guys!) and what you end up 
   with is a deliriously illogical actioner that is must-viewing for all 
   fans of Indonesian insanity. Search it out. Also starring Deddy

   pacing. It is so bad that it becomes an annoyance and this film is 
   full of annoyances. Let me list a few others: You know how some 
   people take photos and they sometimes cut the top of people's heads 
   off in their shots? Well, the cameraman on this film does the exact 
   opposite. In all the close-up shots, everyone's chin is missing from 
   the frame. It's hard to decipher who is talking. The sound recording 
   is like listening to someone talk <A HREF="357_magnum_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/357 magnum 1977 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="233" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>into

   to kill a hitman known as Mr. Clay (Marland T. Stewart, who looks 
   like Adam Sandler with an Abraham Lincoln beard), who is murdering 
   important businessman all over the world (a chance for Millard to 
   insert stock footage of London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and San Francisco to 
   pad out the running time). Jonathan and Steve are set up by their 
   superiors as Mr. Clay ambushes them, kills Steve and seriously wounds 
   Jonathan. He vows revenge on his boss and Mr. Clay and begins a slow 
   process of healing and training to get back in shape so he can exact 
   his revenge. His girlfriend, Claire (Kathryn Hayes), helps him in the 
   healing process, nursing and fucking him back to health. Jonathan's 
   old boss sends two hitmen to kill him (&quot;Hightower's shacked-up 
   with some cunt in Carmel&quot;), but only manage to kill Claire 
   before Jonathan kills them. Now he's really pissed! At least I think 
   he is (it's hard to tell).&nbsp; It's difficult to put into words the 
   ineptitude going on here. There's scenes of a woman performing 
   fellatio on a vibrator for no other other reason than to pad out the 
   film. Don't expect any bullet squibs either. When someone gets shot, 
   they grab their chest and the next shot shows them with blood on 
   their shirt, but no bullet holes (sometimes they don't even bothering 
   showing that!). The climatic gun battle between Jonathan and Mr. Clay 
   should be a primer on how not to shoot an action scene. Hell, this 
   whole film is a study on how not to make an action flick. Consider it 
   an anti-action action film. Even with a running time of only 70 
   minutes, it seemed like a lifetime when it ended. Avoid this at all 
   costs. It was apparently made as a quick cash-in of Clint Eastwood's <B><A HREF="magnum_force_1975.htm">MAGNUM

    JOE</A><A NAME="Tiger Joe"></A> (1982) -</B> Tiger Joe (David 
   Warbeck) and his partner Midnight (Tony King) are gunrunners looking 
   for one final big score so they can retire. Joe is flying some guns 
   to rebels in Cambodia when his plane is shot at by the guerillas, 
   forcing him to crash behind enemy lines. He must trek through the 
   jungle, trying to avoid the guerillas and their many jungle booby 
   traps. He is captured (rather quickly) by the rebels, put in a bamboo 
   cage, has his wounds tended to by Kia (Annie Belle) and is marched 
   through the jungle until they come to a seemingly deserted village. 
   It is a guerilla trap and Joe witnesses the slaughter of most of the 
   rebels he is with. He saves the lives of Kia and Tatu (Rene Abadaza) 
   and they begin to accept him as one of their own. They agree to get 
   Joe across the border and, on their way<A HREF="tiger_joe_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/tiger joe vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   there, Joe witnesses the many hardships and atrocities the rebels 
   must endure to stay alive. Joe becomes sympathetic to their cause 
   (although he pretends not to care) and falls in love with Kia. 
   Meanwhile, Midnight, with the help of mechanic Lenny (Luciano 
   Pigozzi, a.k.a. &quot;Alan Collins&quot;) and fey gun supplier 
   Bronski (Giancarlo Badessi), begins a search and rescue mission. Kia 
   is nearly raped by two guerillas, Tatu is shot and stabbed saving Joe 
   (he eventually dies) and Joe must contend with cobras, dodging 
   bullets and trying to keep Kia safe. Midnight crashes his plane in 
   the jungle and he, Lenny and Bronski join forces with Joe and Kia and 
   look for the rest of Kia's rebel group. They find a cache of weapons 
   (which leads to Lenny and Bronski's death) which they will use to 
   right some wrongs, including blowing up a guerilla train depot. While 
   Kia leads a village full of children to safety, Joe and Midnight hold 
   off the advancing guerillas and steal an enemy gunboat, leading to 
   Midnight's death. Joe finds Kia later on and they live happily ever 
   after.&nbsp; This is a very minor war/adventure film directed by <A HREF="antonio_margheriti_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Antonio
    Margheriti</A>, using his frequent &quot;Anthony M. Dawson&quot; 
   pseudonym. Simplistic in it's approach to right and wrong (the 
   guerillas kill anything that moves, slaughtering villages of women 
   and children while, whenever the rebels are on screen, sad music 
   plays in the background), the closest this film ever comes to making 
   a political statement is when Joe says to Kia, &quot;It not sadness 
   that is killing the world, it's causes.&quot; or when Midnight dies, 
   Joe remarks, &quot;Causes. Those damn causes!&quot; Being an 
   Italian-made film, there's ample examples of racist dialogue 
   (Midnight, who is [what else?] black, is referred to as 'son of 
   Sambo&quot; and &quot;spearchucker&quot;.) but, strangely, nothing is 
   made of Bronski's overt homosexuality (Midnight just calls him 
   &quot;fat ass&quot; a lot). There's also an out-of-place fight 
   between Joe and Midnight towards the end of the film when Lenny dies 
   that makes absolutely no sense and an actual tiger does make an 
   appearance, but it is dropped as fast as it appears. There's also 
   plenty of bloody gunfights, sharp bamboo booby traps and some graphic 
   violence, but the story is just not very involving, as all the 
   characters are one-dimensional or uninteresting (Wait until you hear 
   Midnight scream when Lenny dies!), the situations unbelievable and 
   the violence unremarkable. Antonio Margheriti would use the late

    MISSION</A><A NAME="TopMission1987"></A> (1987) -</B> Here's a 
   little-seen cut-and-paste actioner from director/screenwriter Godfrey 
   Ho (who uses the pseudonyms &quot;Henry Lee&quot; and &quot;Benny 
   Keung&quot; respectively) for producer Tomas Tang's Filmark 
   International Limited production company (although Tang's name isn't 
   listed in the credits). The newly-shot footage concerns two

   sent to stop ex-agent Mike Graves (Philip Gordon), an old friend of 
   the two agents that has gone rogue and formed his own terrorist 
   organization. Lester and Bruce try to talk some sense into Mike 
   before bringing him in (It seems all three of them like to practice 
   martial arts together while wearing brightly-colored ninja outfits 
   with matching masks!), but Mike tells them that he's tired of being a 
   good guy and wants to make some real money (His exact words are, 
   &quot;There is no honor. It's all just bullshit!&quot;). Lester and 
   Bruce walk aw<A HREF="top_mission_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/top mission german dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ay,
    telling Mike that the next time they meet, it won't be under 
   pleasant circumstances. The old footage, the major portion of this 
   film, is some unreleased Filipino actioner (I recognize one of the 
   actors as Yusuf Salim, the star of <B><A HREF="#KrisCommando">KRIS COMMANDO</A></B> 
   [1987]) about a soldier named Abbott, who comes home to find his wife 
   being raped by four scumbags, but before he can stop them, he is 
   knocked-out and his wife and young daughter are killed. He gets 
   revenge by killing the four scumbags in a disco (he shoots one of the 
   guys in the balls), but he is arrested and sent to prison. While 
   behind bars, Abbott joins a gang of crooks called the Tigers and they 
   break out of prison. Meanwhile, another gang of crooks (who are 
   supposedly working with Mike, in a bad melding of old and new 
   footage) have kidnapped an American Professor and two women, but they 
   are saved by a crack team of commandos called the Eagle Force, led by 
   Capt. Alvarez, after a prolonged shootout in an abandoned building. 
   About every twenty minutes or so, Mike sends some of his men to kill 
   Lester and Bruce, which results in quick scenes of gunfire where 
   Mike's guys end up dead. After Abbott and the Tigers escape from 
   prison, they hop on an airplane bound for Manila and hijack it, 
   threatening the lives of the passengers and crew (which includes a 
   horny pilot and his stewardess girlfriend). Abbott demands that a 
   top-secret laser targeting system is delivered to the plane in 
   exchange for the lives of those on-board. Capt. Alvarez and the Eagle 
   Force are sent in to resolve the situation, while Lester and Bruce 
   battle Mike to the death in the finale.&nbsp; While nothing special, <B>TOP
    MISSION</B> does contain plenty of violence and much more nudity and 
   sex than a normal Godfrey Ho film (The first time we see Lester, he's 
   making love to his girlfriend Julie [Olivia Ortiz] and Ho makes sure 
   that the camera lingers lovingly on her erect nipples). The film is 
   basic Ho formula: Grab some unreleased film (Ho has used films from 
   Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand) and 
   rejigger the plot slightly so that the newly-shot footage can be 
   incorporated (You just know that whenever anyone answers or picks up 
   a phone or radio in the old footage, someone in the new footage will 
   be on the other end trying to justify the insertion of the footage. 
   In this case it's Mike, who talks with both the military and the 
   crooks on the phone to make it look like he's behind the plane 
   hijacking). Truth be told, Abbott's transformation from vigilante to 
   heartless hijacker really doesn't make much sense in this version, 
   but I'm sure it does in the original version, which seems to be a 
   cheap knock-off of <B><A HREF="delta_force_1986.htm">THE DELTA FORCE</A></B> 
   (1986). I'm also pretty sure that Abbott and the Tigers didn't ask 
   for a laser targeting system as payment during the hijacking in the 
   original film, but that's half the charm of Ho's pastiche films, 
   spotting the badly-intercutted sequences and laughing at the 
   absurdity of it all. There's also the usual hilarious dubbed dialogue 
   (My favorite: &quot;Killing is one thing, but rape's another. Keep 
   your damn pecker in your pants!&quot;), lots of bullet squibs and 
   three (count 'em, three) rape scenes, making this one of Ho's better 
   entries in his non-martial arts cut-and-paste films. It's total 
   nonsense, but it is lively nonsense. Also starring Mike Smith, Bembol 
   Roco, Marco Antonio, Paul Roldan, Jerry Hart and David Anderson.

   Prete; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#New Barbarians">THE NEW BARBARIANS</A></B> 
   - 1983) and a small platoon of Green Berets are dropped by helicopter 
   behind enemy lines to destroy a Vietcong ammo dump. The helicopter 
   pilot gives Captain Harlow twelve minutes to complete the mission, 
   because it is far too dangerous to be there any longer. If they are 
   not back by then, he is taking off without them. They come upon a 
   village in the jungle that looks abandoned, so Captain Harlow sends 
   two men to check it out, but it turns out the land leading to the 
   village is mined and the two soldiers are instantly killed when they 
   step on landmines. The platoon starts firing their weapons, but Sgt. 
   Maggio tells them to cease-fire because no one is firing back at 
   them. Captain Harlow orders soldier Tom (David Brass; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#JailWomensHell2006">THE
    JAIL: THE WOMEN'S HELL</A></B> - 2006) to go into the village, but 
   Sgt. Maggio tells him to ignore that order, asking Captain Harlow 
   that they already lost two men, what does he want to do, wipe out the 
   platoon? The Captain doesn't want to hear it, ordering Tom to move 
   his ass, the rest of the platoon will cover him. Tom runs toward the 
   village, steps on a landmine and shatters his right leg (a gory shot 
   of bones jutting out of the skin). The Captain says it is probably 
   clear of landmines now, so he gets up and orders the platoon to 
   follow him into the village. When they get to the village, they 
   discover it is an enemy ambush from all sides and it turns into a 
   real firefight this time and they lose another soldier's life to the 
   gunfire, but they kill all the Vietcong in the village. The Captain 
   orders the platoon back to the helicopter, but Sgt. Maggio goes to 
   retrieve Tom (he did promise to come back for him). The Captain 
   doesn't want to wait, ordering the helicopter pilot to take off, 
   which he begrudgingly does, leaving Maggio and Tom behind enemy lines 
   (Tom says, &quot;That bastard is always on schedule!&quot;). Maggio

   Margheriti's <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#JungleRaiders">JUNGLE RAIDERS</A></B> 
   - 1985) wants Maggio to tells him all about Captain Harlow, because 
   he believes the Captain is guilty of putting his men's lives in 
   unnecessary danger, but Maggio refuses, telling Freeman, &quot;We're 
   all in this together&quot;. But does he really believe that?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Maggio tells the base commander that three men are dead and one lost 
   the use of his leg on a mission that could have been done better with 
   a single pass of a Skyhawk armed with two rockets. The base commander 
   doesn't want to hear it, telling Maggio he knows he is tired and strung-out,
    but Maggio tells him, &quot;And some are so strung-out they can't 
   make rational decisions any more.&quot; The base commander warns him 
   that one more act of insubordination and all the citations in the 
   world will not save his ass. Just who is the base commander? Why, 
   none other than Captain Harlow!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The platoon gets five days leave, so everyone celebrates at the 
   local bar. Maggio catches some of his platoon smoking hashish, so he 
   tells them they may think hash makes them invincible, but all it does 
   is slow them down and make irrational decisions. The men ask Maggio 
   why he is so down and he tells them it's because he just learned Tom 
   had to have his leg amputated. Maggio goes to drive them back to 
   base, but one soldier buys a souvenir from a little gook boy on the 
   street, only to have it explode in his face in the back of the Jeep. 
   Maggio drives the soldier to the hospital, where he and his men wait 
   for the news on his condition. Another soldier is in the hospital, 
   telling Maggio that he, too, was the victim of a booby-trapped 
   trinket, but he was lucky because he only received a small scratch, 
   saying to Maggio he doesn't know which is worse, the jungle or the 
   city. It turns out neither is safe if you are an American.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    On their next mission, Maggio and his men are about to discover just 
   how dangerous the jungle really is, as the helicopter they are in is 
   shot down and they are, once again, pinned behind enemy lines, but 
   this time they only lose one man to the violence (even one man is too 
   many to Maggio) before a rescue copter picks them up. Meanwhile, 
   Freeman begins asking some important people why Captain Harlow has a 
   60% casualty rate, which begins to open some eyes, but not in the way 
   you would think. When Maggio returns to base, he discovers that Tom 
   has killed himself in his hospital bed, the pistol still smoking in 
   his hand (Tom was a sprinter back in high school and can't stand only 
   having one good leg, asking Freeman earlier if he knows what it feels 
   like to kick a bed sheet off your body, only to discover you have no 
   leg to do it.). Maggio loses it and runs to put a beatdown on Captain 
   Maggio, but M.P. Sgt. Pike (Ronnie Patterson; Margheriti's <B><A HREF="#CommandoLeopard1985">COMMANDO
    LEOPARD</A></B> - 1985) subdues him. Captain Pike then enters the 
   room and makes a disparaging remark about Tom, so Maggio punches the 
   Captain in the face and throws him over a table. Harlow makes Sgt. 
   Pike arrest Maggio and promises him a court martial, but the truck 
   carrying Maggio to transport him to prison is shelled by the enemy 
   and he escapes (The M.P. tells Maggio to run away, but not to take a 
   gun because then it will be a &quot;shoot on sight&quot; situation 
   which he will not be able to ignore.). Will Maggio be able to teach 
   Captain Harlow a lesson he will soon not forget, while Freeman 
   continues his crusade exposing Harlow as a dangerous command officer? 
   Harlow paints Maggio as a deserter (something akin to a serial killer 
   during wartime), but is anyone buying it? Maggio learns some 
   important lessons in the jungle, where he is captured by the enemy 
   and put through all kinds of torture, as Harlow and some soldiers who 
   have drunk his kool-aid hunt him down, but are the lessons enough to 
   free him from a life spent behind bars? I'm afraid you'll have to 
   watch the film to get the answers to those questions. Needless to 
   say, the finale, which tosses some <B><A HREF="wages_of_fear_1953.htm">WAGES
    OF FEAR</A></B> (1953) action into the mix, is bittersweet, yet 
   satisfying in a strange way. None of Margheriti's war films end on a

   learns sacrifices have to be made, but unlike Captain Harlow, he 
   discovers self-sacrifices are necessary, not other men's lives, even 
   though they are the enemy. While there are some lessons to be

   action come first and foremost and delivering it as only Margheriti 
   can, with style, suspense and a look of professionalism, missing from 
   most Italian war films. This may not be top tier material, but 
   Margheriti delivers what he promises, nothing more, nothing less. 
   This film also has a fairly large role for actor Luciano Pigozzi, 
   who, as &quot;Alan Collins&quot;, had been acting since the mid-'50s. 
   He is best known for the Italian films he appeared in the '60s, like <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#WerewolfGirlsDorm61">WEREWOLF

   - 1968 (he appeared in many of Margheriti's films). This is perhaps 
   his largest role in any film he did in the '80s (he passed away in 
   2008) and he's very good here as a reporter on a mission (I have been 
   a fan for a long time and I have read where one person describes him 
   as Italy's answer to Peter Lorre and it's quite apt, in both looks 
   and acting style.). His conversation with a legless Tom in his 
   hospital bed is the film's most poignant scene, so rather than 
   explain it, I'll let you discover it for yourself. If you are a fan

   arrive by plane in Switzerland and the first thing he does is go to a 
   bank and rent a safety deposit box, where he places his wallet and a 
   tiny envelope (we don't see what is in it) and hides the safety 
   deposit key in a secret compartment in his dog tags, which he wears 
   around his neck. He then goes to a mercenary recruitment center 
   looking for a job, telling the recruiter he doesn't have any 
   identification, but he spent twelve months in Angola. The recruiter 
   then says something in Portuguese (Angola's native language) to 
   Martin and when he doesn't respond, the recruiter gets suspicious. 
   Martin turns to him and says, &quot;I only had to kill them, not talk 
   to them&quot; which the recruiter understands, giving Martin a job 
   that starts in the morning. When morning comes, Martin boards a small 
   plane, noticing a woman named Stella (Lorenza Rodriguez Lopez), who 
   was also at the bank where he rented the safety deposit box. Is this 
   woman keeping a close eye on Martin or is it just a coincidence?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the pilot of the plane, Whitey (actor unknown), asks Martin why 
   he is going to this destination, he replies, &quot;All I know is a 
   bunch of niggers are trying to kill another bunch of niggers. I guess 
   I'll spot my enemies when they start shooting at me.&quot; Whitey 
   lands the plane, telling Martin that this country (I'm guessing 
   somewhere in Africa, because the name is never mentioned) has been at 
   war ever since they declared independence and &quot;Since this 
   country is rich in oil, they can afford white mercenaries.&quot; On 
   the ground, Martin meets his contact, O'Sullivan (Laurence Stark), 
   who tells Whitey he better take off because this region is hot with 
   enemy fire. Whitey tells him he's not worried, the safest place is on 
   his plane. These are Whitey's last words, as an enemy shell explodes 
   near him, killing him and destroying his plane. O'Sullivan looks at 
   the plane and says it's too bad, the plane had twelve cases of booze 
   on board, because he hates scotch, forcing him to buy three cases of <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">J&amp;B
    Scotch</A> (what else?) from a black marketeer.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    O'Sullivan points out the people Martin will be working with, 
   including Major Haggerty (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#NewGladiators1983">THE
    NEW GLADIATORS</A></B> - 1983, who is trying to figure out if 
   recruit DuShane (Isarco Ravaioli; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Mania1974">MANIA</A></B> 
   - 1974) is command material by dropping a live grenade at his feet to 
   see how long it takes him to move (the longer you stay still, the 
   more likely you are to become command material, that is if the 
   grenade doesn't blow you up!). Unfortunately for DuShane, he ducks 
   for cover before Haggerty does and fails the test. There's also 
   Polansky (Wolfango Soldati; <B><A HREF="hotel_fear_1977.htm">HOTEL FEAR</A></B> 
   - 1977), a &quot;Pollock&quot; who carries a white rabbit with him 
   (&quot;Why settle for the foot when you can have the whole

    NIGHT OF THE GLASS DOLLS</A></B> - 1971) and various other war film 
   stereotypes. The Major decides to test new recruit Martin, so he 
   makes him run an obstacle course against black man Wabu (Percy Hogan; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HumanCobras1971">HUMAN
    COBRAS</A></B> - 1971). Martin loses, so the Major makes him a 
   member of the black brigade over Martin's protests. Wabu is forced to 
   sit in a vat full of feces by Leon, who threatens to cut off his head 
   with a machete if he doesn't hold it under the crap for a long period 
   of time. Stella ends up working at the mercenary camp bar and she is 
   still keeping a close eye on Martin, telling him he's 
   &quot;mysterious&quot;, but &quot;nosey&quot;. Wabu, who can't speak 
   a lick of English, becomes friends with Martin, who trains with the 
   black squad. Major Haggerty, who is a raving racist, tries the 
   grenade trick with Martin, but Martin outlasts the Major and nearly 
   gets blown to smithereens. This brings out the Major's admiration for 
   him and he is now part of the white mercenary platoon.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Major announces he is about to go on a &quot;suicide 
   mission&quot; and asks for twenty volunteers. No one volunteers until 
   the Major announces that there will be hefty bonuses for those who 
   survive the mission. Then everyone volunteers, including Martin. The 
   next morning, Martin and the rest of the mercenaries make the trek on 
   foot to their destination, but Martin discovers that Wabu is 
   following him. The racist Major is none too pleased, telling Martin 
   he's responsible for this &quot;boy&quot;. Martin puts his life at 
   risk saving Leon from some quicksand and we soon find out why (and 
   it's all so confusing, I was getting dizzy!). Martin tells the Major 
   his mission is to bring Leon in dead or alive and he will be paid a 
   million dollars. The Major says he will join him on his mission as a 
   partner. O'Sullivan and Polansky overhear the conversation and offer 
   their services to Martin for a piece of the pie and he agrees. The 
   Major makes DuShane and the other mercenaries stay behind (they are 
   all soon killed by the enemy), while he, Martin, O'Sullivan, Polansky 
   and an uninvited Wabu (who doesn't understand because he doesn't know 
   English) take the captive Leon deep through enemy territory to 
   deliver him to the intended destination. Who will survive and collect 
   the hefty reward money (which Martin says is hidden in a safety 
   deposit box)? It turns out a person will do anything for a million 
   bucks. A mercenary will turn against his fellow mercenaries, even 
   kill them in cold blood, to not share the reward money. But which one 
   is it?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   - 1976; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmanuelleCannibal77">EMANUELLE
    AND THE LAST CANNIBALS</A></B> - 1977), is pretty poor, lacking 
   D'Amato's usual flair for bloody violence or sleazy situations. All 
   this film ends up being is another &quot;walk a few miles and lose 
   another member&quot; type of war flick, filmed (cinematography by 
   D'Amato, using his real name, Aristide Massaccesi) without any style 
   or urgency. If it wasn't for Donald O'Brien (listed in the credits as 
   &quot;Donal O'Brien&quot;), I would have turned off the film after 
   the first fifteen minutes, something I never do. He is the only actor 
   in this film to give his character any meaning or energy, even though 
   he is portraying a racist. When it is revealed who the person Martin 
   was <A HREF="tough_to_kill_1978.htm#Ad Mat"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/tough to kill italy ad mat2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>assigned
    to bring in for the million dollars, a collective &quot;Huh?!?&quot; 
   can be heard from the audience, as it makes no sense at all. I mean, 
   why do they have to traverse enemy territory when Leon was already at 
   the mercenary camp? It makes no sense. Wouldn't it have been easier 
   to radio-in for another plane or helicopter to land at the camp than 
   to walk through miles of enemy territory? Screenwriters D'Amato, 
   Giuseppe Zaccariello (as &quot;Joseph McLee&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A
    BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1971) and Sergio Donati (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WeekendMurders1970">WEEKEND
    MURDERS</A></B> - 1970) rather you not think about that because 
   logic has no place in this film. Top-billed star Luc Merenda (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP
    SYNDICATE</A></B> - 1975) spends the final half of this film with a 
   bullet in his leg, so he's basically worthless as this film's action 
   hero, as his fellow mercenaries have to assist him walking and when 
   they are dead, using Wabu to carry him on his shoulders as his own 
   personal slave until Wabu can take no more (Martin says to Wabu, when 
   he doesn't have the strength to carry him any longer, &quot;You dirty 
   nigger, don't do this to me!&quot; Real nice, Martin, you are no 
   better than the Major. Some would say you are worse.). This film is 
   full of possibilities, but none of them are ever realized, such as 
   Martin cutting off Leon's head after his body becomes to smelly to 
   carry (Martin tells the other mercs, &quot;Teeth are just as good as 
   fingerprints!&quot;). Since this is a D'Amato film, you would think 
   he would show Martin cutting off Leon's head but, no, it's not in the 
   budget, just as when some jungle animal is about to attack Martin, 
   all we see is Martin firing his weapon, we never see the animal! Even 
   the &quot;surprise&quot; reveal is not much of a surprise at all. <B>Warning:
    SPOILERS!!!</B> It turns out Wabu can speak and understand English 
   very well, killing Martin and then taking the security deposit box 
   key and cashing-in on Leon's head. But do we see what's in that tiny 
   envelope? No, I guess it just wasn't that important to reveal to us 
   (or they just plain forgot). Even the Stella subplot is dropped 
   mid-film without any explanation. <B>END OF SPOILER!!!</B> Do 
   yourself a favor and skip this one. Just like that tiny envelope, it

   Chucho to share Betsy with them, he refuses and has the crap kicked 
   out of him. They gang-rape Betsy (one member of the gang is a 
   lesbian), pump her full of drugs and turn her out on the streets as a 
   two-bit whore. Jim drives to L.A. in his beat-up pickup truck and 
   goes to the police to report Betsy as a missing person. When Sergeant 
   Miller (John Kerry) discovers that Betsy is underage and tells Jim, 
   &quot;We only handle people, not kids!&quot;, Jim realizes that he 
   will have to find Betsy on his own. Meanwhile, Betsy ends up being

   and a case of culture shock (Jim is hit-on by a gay cowboy and 
   attacked by a gang of black transvestites!), Jim and Lynn trackdown 
   Chucho and he agrees to help Jim find Betsy. What follows next is 
   Montana-style justice, as Jim uses his fists and guns to find his

   free Betsy from Johnny's control, but when Sergeant Miller tells him 
   that vigilante justice may be the only way to get his sister back, 
   Jim gets the hint and turns into a Wild West vigilante, making Johnny 
   Dee's life and business a shambles. When Jim discovers that Betsy is 
   dead, the film turns into a crowd-pleasing revenge actioner with an 
   obvious twist that will fool no one, but is fulfilling

   young runaways, yet the story doesn't pander to the situation. Betsy 
   seems pretty at ease in her new life as a high-priced call girl 
   because the money is good, but just like all less-than-legal 
   occupations, there are drawbacks, including death. When one of her 
   rich johns beats the shit out of her (it's his &quot;thing&quot;) and 
   Johnny refuses to take her to a hospital (He says, &quot;I need this 
   like I need a hole in the head!&quot;), Betsy dies of her wounds. 
   Though most of the action doesn't come until the final third of the 
   film, the story contains enough twists and turns to keep viewers 
   thoroughly entertained. Just like his brother Christopher, the 
   erstwhile Jim Mitchum is stiff as a board, but completely likeable, 
   and both Erik Estrada and Anne Archer register in their roles. While <B><A HREF="trackdown_1976c.htm">TRACKDOWN</A></B>

   kicking some drug-dealing butt when one of her<A HREF="transformed_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/transformed dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   parishioners, Martha (Gina Honda), loses her little boy Kevin (played 
   by the director's son, Efren Pinon Jr.) to a drug overdose. The 
   ass-kicking Pastor does her best to clean up the town, but it is 
   obvious she can't do it alone. A secret government agency 
   unofficially helps Pastor Debra in her quest to rid Westgate of drugs 
   by hiring two vigilantes to help her: The Hammer (a paunchy Fred 
   Williamson, reprising the character from his 1972 blaxploitation 
   classic <B><A HREF="hammer_1972.htm">HAMMER</A></B>) and The Fist (a 
   black-clad and round sunglasses-wearing Leo Fong). The Mayor and 
   Cholo fight back by unifying all the street gangs into one massive 
   entity, but when Cholo's young son is shot in the head by a rival 
   drug dealer and ends up in a coma, Cholo sees the ways of God and 
   prays to the Big Guy to spare his son's life (Uh, oh! I think I can 
   see where this film is heading!). Cholo goes to Pastor Debra and begs 
   for forgiveness, not only from her, but also from her boss, God. 
   Cholo suddenly becomes a good guy and, along with The Hammer, The 
   Fist, Special Agent Dillman George and the high-kicking Pastor Debra, 
   cleans up the town of drug-dealing scum and the crooked Mayor. God 
   rewards Cholo the gift of his son's life, as he miraculously comes 
   out of his coma. The police also forgive Cholo for his 
   drug-dealing-to-kids ways and he apparently gets off scott-free. I 
   guess God forgot about poor Nancy and her dead son. You know what 
   they say: &quot;God works in mysterious ways.&quot; Or is it &quot;The
    good die young?&quot; I think it's just lazy scriptwriting, but I'm 
   afraid to say so because God may not understand.&nbsp; How can I 
   describe how truly awful this film really is? Besides having that 
   flat, shot-on-video look (even though it was filmed in 35mm by Frank 
   Harris, the director of <B><A HREF="#Killpoint">KILLPOINT</A></B> 
   [1984] and <B><A HREF="#LowBlow1986">LOW BLOW</A></B> [1986], both 
   starring Leo Fong) with bad sound recording to match, <B>TRANSFORMED</B> 
   has that preachy &quot;God forgives all&quot; tone that is mixed with 
   scenes of violence towards children that made me want to reach 
   through the screen and slap everyone silly for participating in this 
   God-fearing mess. This film basically tells its audience that it's OK 
   to murder innocent people (including children) and get people 
   (including children) hooked on drugs as long as, in the end, you 
   confess your sins to God, ask for forgiveness and then turn State's 
   evidence against your partners-in-crime. It makes me want to puke on 
   the next preacher I run into. This film is nothing but thinly-veiled 
   religious programming disguised as an urban actioner, which basically 
   preaches that it's fine to kick the shit out of or kill your enemies 
   as long as God is on your side (Isn't that what's religion is really 
   about, anyway?). It's insulting to genre audiences that aren't 
   religious (that includes me) and is really nothing but a double 
   standard, showing violence against children as a pretext to 
   redemption. Director Pinon has no problem showing young kids getting 
   shot in the head or overdosing on drugs because it is 
   &quot;relevant&quot; to God's plan. Fuck that shit. If another film 
   showed the same type of violence without the religious overtones, the 
   Christian Fundamentalists would be up in arms, calling for boycotts 
   or burning the films in community bonfires. Shame on everyone 
   involved here. The only novelty factor this film holds is watching a 
   bunch of over-the-hill action stars (including Tadashi Yamashita [<B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Sword Heaven">SWORD
    OF HEAVEN</A></B> - 1984] as &quot;The Ninja&quot;) beating the crap 
   out of actors less than half their age. Still, it's not enough to get 
   that bad religious taste out of my mouth. Also starring Charles 
   James, Jeremy Flynn, Louis Luciano, Susanne Bonner and D'Arcy Ludwig.

   are driving to California when they become hopelessly lost. They come

   taken a right, because they end up in the unfriendly town of 
   Luddigger in Trapper County, North Carolina (Jesus Christ, how long 
   were they driving before they noticed that they were lost?). After 
   stopping at the local diner and meeting waitress Lacey Luddigger 
   (Betsy Russell; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Camp Fear">CAMP FEAR</A></B> 
   - 1994), who Ryan takes an instant shine to, the two boys get a dose 
   of Southern inhospitality in the form of deputy Walt Luddigger (Don

   - 1987), who tells them to take their faggot earrings and get the 
   hell out of town. Rather than heed the warning, Ryan and Bobby decide 
   to stay (it wouldn't be much of a film if they left) and, at the 
   local bar that night, Ryan hooks up with Lacey and is forced to beat 
   the crap out of Walt when he tries to ambush them in the parking lot. 
   Lacey tells Ryan her sordid story (She an<A HREF="trapper_county_war_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/trapper county war vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>d
    her brother Elmore [Todd Maxwell] were taken in by the Luddigers 
   when their parents were killed and &quot;step-brother&quot; Walt has 
   tried to rape her on several occasions), so Ryan tells her to pack 
   her bags and they'll leave town that night. They should have left 
   right then and there because walt arrests Ryan and Bobby on 
   kidnapping charges when they try to leave town with Lacey (who is a 
   few weeks short of eighteen years-old) later that night. As Ryan and 
   Bobby are hauled off the jail by Sheriff Sam Frost (Bo Hopkins; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sweet Sixteen 1982">SWEET
    SIXTEEN</A></B> - 1982), Walt brings Lacey home to Mom and Pop 
   Luddigger (Sarah Lunley and R.G. Armstrong), who nails her bedroom 
   window shut and locks her in her room. A few hours later, Walt 
   kidnaps Ryan and Bobby from the jail and brings them to the middle of 
   the woods, where Mom and Pop are waiting to torture them with a 
   sledgehammer. Ryan and Bobby break free, but during the ensuing 
   fracas Bobby is shotgunned to death, Elmore is accidentally hit on 
   the head with a sledgehammer and killed, while Ryan escapes into the 
   forest. Mom, Pop and Walt must find and kill Ryan before he spills 
   the beans to Sheriff Frost, who is tired of the Luddiggers' brutal 
   hold on the town. Ryan is about to find out that the Luddiger's reach 
   is long (there are more Luddiggers in the county than the name Chin 
   in a Chinese phone book, thanks to what looks like centuries of 
   inbreeding), but he finds an ally in Vietnam vet Jefferson Carter 
   (Ernie Hudson; <B><A HREF="leviathan_1989.htm">LEVIATHAN</A></B> - 
   1989), who has a long-standing feud with the Luddiggers that needs to 
   be settled. The finale finds Ryan and Jefferson battling the 
   Luddigger clan in a forest full of boobytraps, with Lacey (who is 
   tied to a tree in the best villain tradition) separating the good 
   guys from the hicks. When Sheriff Frost joins the side of Ryan and 
   Jefferson, the odds even up a bit, as the Luddiggers all meet their 
   demise one-by-one until only Mom is left. Lacey makes sure that Mom 
   doesn't live to take another swig of moonshine. The only good 
   hillbilly is a dead hillbilly, or so I'm constantly reminded in films 
   like this.&nbsp; This is one in a long line of hicksploitation

   couple of uncomfortable scenes between Don Swayze and Betsy Russell, 
   the rest of the Luddigger clan is about as threatening as the sight

    VERNONIA INCIDENT</A><A NAME="VernoniaIncident"></A> (1989) -</B> 
   Two thieves, Link (David Jackson) and Bike (Shawn Stevens), drive 
   into the town of Vernonia, Oregon and hold up the town's mini mart. 
   After killing the town's only police officer, the thieves attempt to 
   leave town, but the citizens follow them in their cars (they keep in 
   touch with each other by CB radio). The thieves kill another guy by 
   forcing his car off the road (in one of the slowest car chases in 
   film history) and then hear on the radio that they are wanted by 
   authorities (this, just a mere three minutes after pulling off the 
   robbery!). The citizens block all the roads out of town, forcing Link 
   and Bike to crash through a blockade, which disables their car. With 
   the townspeople not far behind, Link and Bike hole-up in a farmhouse 
   and hold the family inside hostage. As the townspeople surround the 
   house, Link calls his brother Hank (Robert Louis Jackson) on the 
   phone and asks him to come to Vernonia and rescue him and Bike. As Hank<A HREF="vernonia_incident_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/vernonia incident vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   steals a car and heads to Vernonia, he and partner-in-crime Vern 
   (Tony Hyde) are cornered by police, but manage to commandeer a 
   helicopter! With the townspeople shooting at the farmhouse (ignoring 
   the fact that there's an innocent family in there!), Link and Bike 
   keep low and get drunk until Hank arrives. Hank forces the helicopter 
   pilot to stop at a construction site, where he steals a crate of 
   dynamite and then heads for Vernonia. Meanwhile, Link tries to rape 
   the woman hostage, but is interrupted when tear gas in lobbed into 
   the house (again ignoring the innocent family). Hank begins throwing 
   lit dynamite from the helicopter at a police car, causing it to crash 
   and burn. Hank makes it to the farmhouse, throwing dynamite at the 
   citizens (blowing up empty cars parked in the middle of a field) and 
   they, in turn, return fire at the helocopter. Link and Bike run to 
   the helicopter with the little girl hostage as a shield. When they 
   attempt to take off, they find they are out of fuel. It is at this 
   time, the little girl's mother (who was nearly raped) and the 
   townspeople surround the helicopter and open fire, supposedly killing 
   everyone inside (we never do actually see the carnage).&nbsp; This 
   pitiful excuse for a film is a prime example of how not to make a 
   film. Filled with terrible acting, bad post-synch dubbing and a 
   grating music score, <B>THE VERNONIA INCIDENT</B> is the type of film 
   that's best forgotten and tucked away in some dark corner and never 
   heard from or seen again. Director/producer/scripter Ray Etheridge 
   (whose next film would be <B><A HREF="fart_the_movie_1991.htm">FART: 
   THE MOVIE</A></B> - 1991) hasn't got a clue how to frame a scene and 
   definitely hasn't a clue how to stage an action scene. It's plain to 
   see that all the cars used in explosions and crashes are gutted 
   junkers, as most are missing windshields and are rusted beyond 
   repair. This is the type of film where everyone owns a gun, but no 
   one could hit the side of a barn (they do manage to shoot a lot of 
   windows, though). There are also entire scenes where it switches from 
   day to night (One scene shows a citizen firing at the thieves and 
   it's plainly daylight. When the thieves are dodging the bullets, it's 
   pitch dark!), Shawn Stevens (as Bike) is constantly humming out loud 
   (even when he's getting shot at) and the people point guns and we 
   hear a &quot;bang!&quot; even though they never pull the trigger (I 
   guess that saved some money on blank cartridges). Wait until you see 
   the tear gas canisters: They are nothing but tin cans with holes 
   poked in them! Though most of this movie is shot on film, videotape 
   is utilized for most of the helicopter scenes and the finale. The 
   finale is edited in such a haphazard way, that it gives the 
   impression that the mother and the citizens kill the little girl and 
   the innocent pilot, along with the crooks. I can honestly say that 
   this is one of the crappiest, most boring pieces of celluloid sludge 
   that I have ever seen. Don't take that as a recommendation, though, 
   because it's not even worth viewing for shits and giggles. It's just 
   bad. Believe it or not, Sub Rosa Studios released this on DVD under

   (1983) -</B> Outlandish Filipino actioner. A gang of bald-headed, 
   chopper-riding drug peddlers (even the female members are bald!) roll 
   into town and get into a fight with police sergeant W2 (Anthony 
   Alonzo). He ends up shooting one of the gang members and his boss, 
   Major Medina (Joonee Gamboa), suspends W2 from the force. The gang 
   members steal their comrade's dead body from the morgue and bring him 
   back to their leader, Nesfero (Johnny Montero), who declares war on 
   W2 because the dead gang member happened to be his brother. The gang 
   attack W2 and some police buddies (they all have single letter names 
   followed by a number) at a restaurant using machine guns, but W2 and 
   his buddies escape. Things really go south for W2 on his honeymoon, 
   where Nesfero and his men castrate W2 and rape his wife (Ann Marrie). 
   When W2 wakes up in the hospital, discovers that his package is a 
   little light and realizes that he will no longer be able to satisfy 
   his wife, he vows revenge (Later on, he watches his naked wife 
   masturbate in the shower and totally loses it. He screams to his 
   wife, &quot;I'm useless! I'm a eunich!&quot;). Nesfero is expecting a 
   huge shipment of opium and the Syndicate is worried that he is 
   fixating too much on W2, so Nesfero kidnaps <A HREF="w_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/w 1983 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>W2
    and tortures him (he's strung-up and hung horizontally by ropes 
   between four posts). He is rescued by female gang member Pratings 
   (Ada Hubert), who tells W2 that Nosfero raped her and that he's the 
   Devil (&quot;He's gone mad!&quot;). Major Medina assigns Lieutenant 
   V1 (Bing Davao) to find the missing W2. So what's the first thing V1 
   does? Why he goes swimming in flesh-colored Speedos with W2's horny 
   wife and then makes love to her! W2 returns home and catches them in 
   the act (She says haltingly, &quot;I really don't know what 
   came...over us!&quot;) and throws his wife out of the house. Pratings 
   tells W2 about Nesfero's upcoming opium shipment, so W2, Pratings and 
   some buddies intercept and steal the shipment, which puts Nesfero in 
   hot water with Syndicate boss Praxis (Paul Vance). What Nesfero does 
   next is truly brain-busting. He and his men take an entire Catholic 
   nursery school hostage and threaten to kill all the children unless 
   the opium shipment is returned and W2 is delivered to them! Police 
   reporter Alice (Alicia Alonzo, Anthony's real-life sister) gets 
   involved in the case when she finds out her daughter is one of the 
   hostage children, but her stupidity gets her daughter killed. W2 
   comes out of hiding (after he creates an armor-plated car, body armor 
   and a hand-held rocket launcher) and faces Nosfero and his gang in 
   the explosive finale.&nbsp; This crazy Philippines-lensed action 
   flick, directed and scripted by Willie Milan (<B><A HREF="ultimax_force_1986.htm">ULTIMAX
    FORCE</A></B> - 1986), is one wild ride. The plot makes absolutely 
   no sense and looks like it was edited with a chainsaw (some violence 
   and nudity seems to have been cut out in this version, especially 
   noticable in the shower masturbation scene), but this film is so 
   perverse and out-there (A castrated man as an action hero? Who would 
   have thought?), you'll wonder what alternate universe this film was 
   made on. Filled with hilarious dialogue (When one of the cops asks 
   Major Medina where they should look for the missing W2, he snaps 
   back, &quot;Search in Hell if you must!&quot; or W2's rant to Major 
   Medina when he won't lift his suspension: &quot;I put my ass on the 
   line while you sit back and polish your medals!&quot; That line of 
   dialogue is repeated at least three time while Major Medina has a 
   crisis of conscience in his office!), and mindless violence, 
   including explosions, multiple gunfights, child killing and W2's 
   assault on Nesfero's beach compound in the finale, where both he and 
   Pratings don handmade steel helmets, which make them both look like 
   the Rocketeer! Hey, this isn't rocket science, but <B><A HREF="w_1983b.htm">W</A></B>

    BUS</A><A NAME="WarBus"></A> (1985) -</B> After their goodwill 
   mission is attacked by the Vietcong, the remaining survivors escape 
   in their yellow schoolbus. A short distance down the road, their bus 
   is commandeered by Sgt. Dixie (Daniel Stephen) and his two-man squad 
   of American Marines. The missionaries, which includes three women; 
   Ronny (Don Gorden Bell), a nervous man; Debrard (Steve Eliot), an 
   Australian soldier and a VC Major named Kutran (Ernie Zarate), form 
   an uneasy alliance with the American soldiers as they make the 
   perilous journey behind enemy lines to freedom. Running low on gas, 
   the soldiers raid an enemy depot looking for some fuel, not knowing 
   that the sweaty (and possibly traitorous) Ronny has reserve gas 
   hidden under the bus. While the soldiers are on the raid, Ronny fuels 
   up the bus and tries to take off, but is stopped by Debrand<A HREF="warbus_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/warbus vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and Major Kutran. Sgt. Dixie and his men, Gus (Romano Kristoff) and 
   Ben (Urs Althaus), become pinned-down at the enemy depot, but the 
   bus, driven by Major Kutran, comes to their rescue. They manage to 
   get the gas and blow up the enemy depot, thanks to the Major's help. 
   Their next obstacle is a bridge they need to cross that is guarded by 
   enemy soldiers. Ben comes up with a plan and it goes off without a 
   hitch (they manage to kill dozens of enemy soldiers with no 
   casualties on their side), which earns them respect from the Major 
   (he salutes the soldiers for their bravery). They next happen upon a 
   field of dead American soldiers, all of them crucified and 
   boobytrapped. Since they can't bury them, Sgt. Dixie blows them up 
   (the film's most affecting scene). They find a cave to hide the bus 
   in while the soldiers check out a village with an American helicopter 
   in the middle of it. They find all the American soldiers dead (one 
   body is riddled with steel nails!) and then realize that the enemy 
   was waiting for them. Everyone manages to escape alive, thanks again 
   to the Major and Ronny, who proves to be no traitor. They next stop 
   at a deserted VC village, where Major Kutran finds a radio and calls 
   for help. Instead of being saved, our ragtag group of soldiers and 
   civilians must fight for their lives when enemy soldiers intercept 
   the Major's transmission and not everyone will make it out alive. War 
   is truly hell and hell is for heroes.&nbsp; Directed with much 
   pyrotechnics and a surprising amount of humanity by Ferdinando Baldi (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#CominAtYa">COMIN'

   is one of the better Italian-made Vietnam War action flicks. The 
   action comes at a steady clip as dozens of people are gunned-down, 
   blown-up or stabbed. There are many surprises along the way, such as 
   the reveal that Ronny is a schizophrenic epileptic (which explains 
   his earlier actions) and that Debrand is a convicted murderer. The 
   three women on the bus have precious little to do except look scared, 
   go skinnydipping or act as romantic interests for the soldiers. 
   There's a scene towards the end where Major Kutran finds a radio in a 
   deserted VC village and tunes to a station playing music and, for a 
   few short moments, everyone on the bus and in town relaxes and 
   forgets the trouble they are in. It's a poignant scene that's unusual 
   in a film like this and foreshadows the tragic events that are about 
   to happen. The final assault by the enemy on the town is well-handled 
   and full of scenes of bravery. <B>WAR BUS</B> tells an excellent 
   story to go along with the action and should satisfy fans of the

   Hondo, wishes to see him. His father pleads with Johnny to go to 
   Afghanistan to retrieve important documents that he left on a school 
   bus years earlier and rescue some friends and colleagues he had to 
   leave behind. Ross puts together a team to help Johnny in his

    Cain (Savina Gersak), Bobby Lee and Norton, who will all help Johnny 
   get across the Afghanistan border to safety once he finds the 
   documents and rescues the prisoners. Johnny is forced to bail out of 
   his helicopter way too early and lands 82 miles from his objective, 
   so he must fight his way to the bus, while Ross and the team wait to 
   hear from him. It's also plain to see that Ross and Linda know more 
   about this mission than they're letting on. Johnny finally makes it 
   to the bus after getting help from a young boy named Kabir (who he 
   promises to take to America), but he is captured by an Russian 
   captain and tortured. Kabir's sister frees Johnny, but she loses her 
   life in the process. Johnny and Kabir find his father's colleagues, 
   but Ross informs him by radio that his team cannot come and rescue 
   him. Johnny and his ragtag group then decide to fix the bus and drive 
   themselves to safety. First they must find the parts to fix it and 
   reinforce it with armor plating. They are then relentlessly pursued 
   by Russian troops. Running low on gas, they raid a remote Russian 
   depot, steal some fuel and destroy the depot before continuing on 
   their way. In the finale, Johnny learns that there's traitors within 
   his ranks, but instead of getting even, he just shrugs it off. The 
   Green Berets would not be pleased.&nbsp; The two main distractions 
   that severely affect this film are obvious: Mark Gregory is an 
   unappealing and stiff action hero here and his only facial expression 
   makes it seem like he is always smelling someone's stinky farts. It 
   gets annoying after a few minutes and it's apparent he's a one-note 
   actor. So apparent, that he quit acting soon after starring in this. 
   Good move. The second glaring distraction is the dubbed voice used by 
   John Vernon. Any lover of film is well aware what the late John 
   Vernon's voice sounds like, so to hear such a strange voice come out 
   of this mouth every time he speaks is just not right. It throws the 
   viewer off balance and Vernon's scenes don't work because of it (I 
   guess the producers couldn't afford Mr. Vernon's dubbing fee). The 
   action scenes are also very dry and not very exciting. While there 
   are plenty of gunfights and explosions, director Pierluigi Ciriaci 
   (using the pseudonym &quot;Frank Valenti&quot;) uses a minimal amount 
   of bullet squibs and keeps the blood and carnage to almost 
   non-existent levels. Ciriaci, who also directed <B><A HREF="delta_force_commando_1987.htm">DELTA
    FORCE COMMANDO</A></B> (1987) and <B><A HREF="delta_force_commando_2_1990.htm">DELTA
    FORCE COMMANDO 2</A></B> (1990), hasn't got a clue how to film an 
   action scene and the script, by Dardano Sacchetti (using the name 
   &quot;David Parker Jr.) is a generic war clich&eacute;s that offers 
   no surprises and even less excitement. While the first <B>WAR BUS</B>

   by the enemy before they can deliver Wild Weasel into safe hands. 
   Wilson and Garvey are then &quot;rescued&quot; by some Vietnamese

   arduous road to safety, marked by many gunfights and explosions, as 
   everyone, from the enemy, the U.S. government and the Russians (one 
   of them played by Filipino film staple Nick Nicholson) wants to get 
   their hands on Wild Weasel and don't care if Wilson or Garvey survive 
   (One American arms smuggler, working as a liaison between the 
   Russians and a crooked U.S. government official, calls up the crooked 
   official and says, &quot;You realize you just screwed-up my 
   future!&quot; to which the crooked official replies, &quot;I'm sorry 
   to hear that.&quot; and then hangs up the phone. A few seconds later, 
   the arms smuggler is shot dead by the Russians!). As the film 
   advances, it becomes apparent that both Lt. Garvey and Ngu-Yen may 
   not be who they seem. Ngu-Yen mortally stabs Garvey one night and 
   delivers the Wild Weasel to the commander of the enemy forces (who 
   promptly shoots and kills Ngu-Yen for being a traitor!). When Garvey 
   commits suicide because he can't stand the pain, Wilson and Nam (who 
   have fallen in love) must find their way across the Thailand border 
   into safety, but there are a few surprises to be had along the way 
   (especially concerning a necklace that Nam wears, which is a doozy!). 
   This is another crazy Filipino war actioner, directed by the late 
   Teddy Page (<B><A HREF="#Blood Debts">BLOOD DEBTS</A></B> - 1983; <B><A HREF="#Ninja'sForce">NINJA'S

    SOLDIERS</A></B> - 1987), that contains plenty of &quot;What The 
   Fuck?!?&quot; moments and dialogue. My favorite is when the foursome 
   finds a disabled dune buggy in the middle of the jungle and, in true 
   80's montage fashion, go through a lot of trouble getting it in 
   running condition and outfitting it with a machine gun torrent. They 
   end up abandoning it a few miles down the road when it stalls and 
   refuses to start back up. For all the time and effort they spent on 
   fixing the cursed buggy (Which Garvey calls an &quot;FRV&quot;, but 
   never explains what it stands for!), they could have walked ten times 
   the distance the damned buggy traveled before it broke down. Another 
   hilarious sequence comes when the foursome are lost in the jungle and 
   Wilson says, &quot;If we only had a map!&quot; Ngu-Yen looks at him 
   and says, &quot;I have a map...but it's in French!&quot;. I nearly 
   pissed my pants. Toss in plenty of bloody bullet squibs, fiery 
   explosions and a coincidence during the finale that's too good to be 
   true (Nam and the Commander of the enemy forces are long-lost sister 
   and brother and he suddenly turns into a good guy and helps her, 
   Wilson and Wild Weasel escape from the nasty Russians and corrupt 
   U.S. officials!) and what you have is a film that's short on logic, 
   but hugely entertaining. I've just scratched the surface on what's on 
   view here. I'll leave the rest for you to discover for yourselves

   but they know Don Alfredo protects him. Calise doesn't care and 
   leaves to make a phone call. When one of Santoro's hoods tells him he 
   is losing too much money and he should quit, Santoro tells him, 
   &quot;I'm a successful man in life because I never give up.&quot; 
   Later in the night, when Santoro leaves the gambling den, he is 
   blitzed by three men with guns, who open fire, killing Santoro's 
   driver. As the hoods fire away at Santoro in his car, they discover 
   that the car is bulletproof, so one of the hoods grabs the dead 
   driver's keys and goes to unlock the car's door. Just when it looks 
   like Santoro is about to die in a hail of bullets, Belli arrives on 
   the scene, shooting and killing one of the hoods and saving Santoro's 
   life. Santoro thanks Belli for saving his life and asks him if he 
   knew if it was him he was saving (he didn't), would he have saved his 
   life? Belli replies, &quot;They pay me to protect everyone, the 
   honest people and pimps like you.&quot; Santoro tells Belli he has no 
   idea who was trying to kill him, but that's an obvious lie. Santoro 
   knows that Calise and Licata are behind the assassination attempt and 
   he is about to dish out his own brand of justice, beginning with two 
   of his hoods blowing up Calise's unfinished mansion with dynamite, 
   which was still under construction.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   trucks, which runs a family of four off the road, causing their car 
   to roll down and embankment and fall off a cliff, exploding and 
   killing them all. When Belli's police car is disabled in the chase, 
   he commandeers a van on the highway, telling the driver to follow the 
   truck. Belli is quite the acrobat, jumping out of the van onto the 
   back of the truck, walking on top of the two tankers until he gets to 
   the driver, whom he shoots in the head when he pulls out a gun, 
   pulling the truck to the side of the road.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Santoro and his men then rob the payroll from an oil refinery; 
   killing everyone they come in contact with. This results in two car 
   chases, one between the police and Santoro's hoods and one between 
   Belli and Santoro. When one of the officers is severely burned when 
   their car rolls over and catches fire (and the hood's car explodes, 
   killing them all), Belli and Santoro's chase ends when both of their 
   cars are destroyed (Santoro just drives his car head-on into 
   Belli's). Santoro can easily kill Belli as he lies on the ground 
   dazed from the impact, but he decides not to, telling Belli, &quot;Now
    we're even.&quot; This action casts doubt on Belli being an honest 
   cop, especially with his superiors. Belli tells them this is exactly 
   what Santoro wants them to think and promises to bring Belli into 
   their office alive to prove he is not corrupt (&quot;Even though I 
   would like to stick my gun down his throat and pull the 
   trigger.&quot;). Three of Santoro's masked men rob Licata &amp; 
   Calise's gambling parlor, taking all the money and everyone's 
   wallets, only they are not Santoro's men, they are Belli's undercover 
   officers. They deliver the money and wallets to Belli, who finds a 
   very incriminating letter in Licata's wallet (Belli tells an officer 
   to donate the money, 27 million lire, to the fund for orphans of 
   police officers killed in the line of duty and make sure it is from 
   an unnamed benefactor). Belli then goes to Licata and threatens to 
   release the incriminating letter to the Press unless he plays ball 
   with him. Licata agrees and agrees to set-up Santoro (he's now a 
   wanted man with charges that will stick). After taking one of 
   Santoro's associate's car, Licata calls the associate and tells him

   tires from the car and selling them to an illegal chop shop. This boy 
   has a real future as a conman, that is if Belli doesn't catch him in 
   the act and send him to reform school. Now that Santoro is a wanted 
   man, Belli puts his plan into action. When Santoro's associate finds 
   his car missing, he takes a taxi, driven by Guidi, to Santoro's 
   hideout, but he is far too cunning and escapes capture, after killing 
   his associate, whom Belli was following (like I said before, he 
   leaves no witnesses!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Gianni sees a photo shoot taking place on the streets of 
   Naples, where a famous racecar driver is being photographed, he 
   steals the driver's racecar, taking it for an extremely fast joyride 
   through the busy streets of Naples and then ditching the car by the 
   side of a road. Belli knows it was Gianni, but he can't prove it (He 
   actually admires the kid's moxey). An undercover officer, who is 
   watching one of Santoro's associate's apartment, tells Belli that 
   something smells fishy; the associate hasn't left his apartment for 
   days. When Belli goes to investigate, he finds that Santoro is there. 
   Gianni's driving skills come in handy when Belli gets into a foot 
   chase with Santoro and captures him, but several of Santoro's men 
   approach Belli, knives and guns drawn. Gianni shows up in the nick of 
   time in Belli's car and saves Belli, who takes Santoro to his 
   superiors' office, proving he is not a corrupt cop. Even in prison, 
   Santoro's reach has no boundaries, as two of his hoods kill the 
   undercover cop who fingered Santoro by decapitating him with a wire 
   strung around two trees as he speeds down the road on his motorcycle 
   (a scene copied nearly verbatim in <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Raiders Of Atlantis">RAIDERS

    We then see a pedophile (Adolfo Lastretti; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   -1974) being attacked in a park by parents and on-lookers when he 
   tries to abduct a young girl. He is sent to the same prison Santoro 
   resides in, which is key to him escaping from prison. When the 
   pedophile is sitting in the prison yard, a riot breaks out when all 
   the prisoners beat up and stab the pedophile. Santoro swaps places 
   with the pedophile as he is being transported to the hospital, a plan 
   cooked-up by Don Alfredo. Alfredo tells Santoro that he should get 
   out of Naples for good, so Santoro make plans to travel to Metz, 
   France, which Belli find out about. Belli discovers that an old flame 
   of Santoro's, Lucia Parisi (Evelyn Stewart; <B><A HREF="#SyndicateSadists75">SYNDICATE
    SADISTS</A></B> - 1975), lives in Metz and Belli comes up with a 
   plan to capture Santoro again by transporting Lucia back to Naples 
   and making sure that Santoro finds out about it (Santoro knows that 
   Lucia is coming to Naples to sign an affidavit that could put him 
   away for life). With Guidi protecting Lucia on the train, Belli 
   stakes out the train station for Santoro. Gianni and Nardi are also 
   at the train station, selling tap water that they have bottled 
   themselves and selling it as expensive mineral water to people on the 
   train. Santoro arrives and Gianni tells Belli where he is. A shootout 
   between Belli and Santoro takes place, which results in Santoro 
   getting shot and falling from a moving train; getting graphically run 
   over by the train's metal wheels. In what should be a satisfying 
   ending to Belli's mission, he discovers that Gianni has been shot by 
   one of Santoro's stray bullets. Gianni tells Belli that he decided to 
   go to regular school and become a professor or engineer, as he dies 
   in Belli's arms. Films like this rarely have a happy ending, as Belli 
   walks away with a dead Gianni in his arms.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   director Umberto Lenzi's <B><A HREF="violent_naples_1976.htm">VIOLENT NAPLES</A></B> 
   (1976), which starred Maurizio Merli as Commissioner Betti. Those of 
   you who have seen the film (as I have) will instantly recognize 
   Massimo Deda as Gianni and know why he walks with a limp in the 
   sequel. Deda is the only actor to return as the same character, but 
   many more actors from the first film return for the sequel, but in 
   different roles. (Notice the difference between &quot;Betti&quot; and 
   &quot;Belli&quot;, as Belli makes a reference to Betti by mentioning 
   him as a &quot;predecessor&quot;, but not mentioning his name). This 
   is one of the best poliziotteschi films out there (but I prefer to 
   call the genre &quot;Eurocrime&quot;), due to its early eye-opening 
   full-frontal female nudity (once again, yowza!), graphic violence 
   (including a decapitation, a fire gag [we get to see the burned 
   policeman's face towards the end of the film, as he is still alive 
   and tells Belli that he's going to return to duty] and too many 
   bloody bullet squibs to count) and non-stop action, including 
   shoot-outs, car chases and fistfights. I always admired Mario 
   Caiano's directing style and this film cements that admiration. The 
   music score, by Francesco De Masi (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982) is also very memorable, especially 
   the music used whenever Gianni is on the screen, giving his petty 
   crimes some added humor (you'll have to listen to it to appreciate 
   it). I also believe this is Leonard Mann's best role of his career 
   (he's still alive [at the time this review was written]), but he 
   suddenly quit acting in the late-'80s and became a film teacher in 
   the Los Angeles school district! He was one of those American actors 
   that fell in love with Italy, but when genre movie-making waned there 
   (and never recovered), he moved back to the States, appearing is 
   films such as <B><A HREF="night_school_1981.htm">NIGHT SCHOOL</A></B>

    his last film, an Italian production titled <B><A HREF="last_emotion_1989.htm">THE
    LAST EMOTION</A></B> (1989), an erotic thriller that has basically 
   gone unseen since its theatrical release in Italy, before retiring 
   from his profession and becoming a teacher. I often wonder if the 
   downfall of Italian cinema had anything to do with his quitting the 
   profession, because in the documentary <B><A HREF="eurocrime_2012_documentary.htm">EUROCRIME!</A></B> 
   (2012), he states that he would gladly return to Italy if genre 
   filmmaking were to become popular again. What can I say about Henry 
   Silva that hasn't already been said? He's one cool cat as Santoro, 
   killing friends and foes alike, always with a smile on his face. It's 
   easy to see why he was in demand in Italy. No one could play a 
   villain better than Silva. His bad guys (and even good guys, such as 
   the flawed cop in <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST HUMAN</A></B> 
   - 1974) were always very memorable. Silva is in very poor health as I 
   write this (He's 90-years-old for Christ's sake!), but if anyone 
   could beat the Grim Reaper at his own game, it's him! Be aware that 
   even though Evelyn Stewart (real name: Ida Galli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977) is given star billing, her role is basically 
   an extended cameo, appearing during the finale of the film, her 
   screen time no longer than three minutes. But it's Massimo Deda as 
   Gianni who steals the show here, giving his character just enough 
   street smarts and sass to make his death an emotional journey for the 
   viewer. It is too bad that his career never materialized, this being 
   his penultimate performance. If you want to watch a Eurocrime film 
   that fires on all cylinders and then steals some more to fire on, you 
   can do no better than this film. I'm a huge fan of this genre and 
   this film is what most Eurocrime flicks aspire to be. No bullshit.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   interests on the island hire a squad of mercenaries to rescue the

   saves all their hides. Martin and his team head down the 
   crocodile-infested river and make it to the halfway point, where they 
   must traverse the rest of the way through the jungle by foot.

   but is captured by the mean Fuego (Ivan Rassimov; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B>

   they watch an entire village of innocent women and children being 
   slaughtered by Gomez's soldiers, so Martin and his squad kill all the 
   soldiers in retribution (Paco is extremely talented with his bow).

   hiding them? They definitely weren't lugging them along on their 
   trek!) and fly through the air, landing less than a mile from the 
   boy's location. They battle their way to the jungle camp, where Paco 
   silently infiltrates the camp and takes-out the generator, turning 
   off the electric fence that surrounds the camp. Then, Martin and his 
   team do what they do best: Killing the bad guys, blowing up 
   everything and everyone they can get their hands on and rescuing the 
   boy. Things take a tragic turn when the mining conglomerate switch 
   sides and assassinate Cordura and then try to kill Martin, his team 
   and the boy, which results in Marius getting killed and Theo heading 
   out on his own. As the little boy leads the rest of the team to 
   safety, Theo is captured by Fuego and turns traitor. The finale finds 
   our heroes battling it out with Fuego and a platoon of soldiers while 
   the boy tries to discover if a local legend (a hidden tunnel behind a 
   waterfall that will let them escape through the mountains) is true. 
   Who will make it to safety?&nbsp; This is a pretty enjoyable and

    FINAL EXECUTIONER</A></B> - 1983) provide plenty of bloody violence 
   (squishy bullet squibs; arrow impalements; people being blown apart) 
   and enough twists and turns in the plot (even though most of them are 
   telegraphed early on) to keep the viewer's mind from wondering about 
   some of the gaping plot holes (the storage of the hang gliders being 
   one of the biggest &quot;Huh?&quot; moments). The inclusion of the 
   psychics to find the boy's location was a very entertaining idea, but 
   it is dropped after a couple of minutes (it's a shame, too, because 
   it would have been an interesting running gag). Although the boy 
   seems to have some kind of supernatural power (How else to explain 
   how he made an attack dog so docile?), but it is never really 
   expanded upon throughout the rest of the film. Lenzi does that with a 
   lot of his films: He throws anything he can come up with at the

   to a police inspector (Tomas Milian; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST

   tell him what their next move is. It's robbing a bank, as Paul 
   callously shoots and kills the assistant manager.&nbsp; Paul and Joe

    After robbing the bank and throwing the money out the car window to 
   some appreciative pedestrians (they do the robberies for kicks, not 
   for the money), they ditch their car and steal another one, always 
   keeping a step ahead of the police. The Inspector brings the trio's 
   parents into his office in hopes of learning anything that will 
   result in their arrest and capture, but all he learns is that they 
   come from privilege, their parents not caring much of what happens to 
   their sons. The trio hide out at the house of Paul's friend, Lucio 
   (Diego Abatantuono), where Louis calls Lea on the phone. Joe, who is 
   always laughing and cracking jokes at the most inopportune times, 
   nearly rapes the girls Lucio has staying at his house, before Paul 
   breaks it up. Lea tells Louis to get away from the other two, unaware 
   that the Inspector has tapped her phone. Lucio, who is about to rob a 
   supermarket with his friends, has a wall full of automatic weapons, 
   so he and Paul put some of them in a bag and head out to the 
   supermarket. The trio leave the house just before the Inspector and 
   his men arrive. Lucio and his friends rob the supermarket and the 
   trio tag along, Paul killing Lucio's friends in cold blood as they 
   rob the market. Once again, Louis does not participate in the robbery 
   or the killings (Paul promises to tell the police that if they are 
   ever caught), ignoring the fact that the law doesn't discriminate, as 
   there is no difference in the law's eyes between participating or 
   guilt by association. Louis then meets Lea, so Paul kidnaps her, 
   telling Louis that he doesn't trust her, not knowing that they have 
   crossed the line with the law, as kidnapping is punishable by death. 
   They stop at an auto junkyard to get some forged passports and 
   papers, but when one of the forgers (Salvatore Billa; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WerewolfWoman1976">WEREWOLF

   he better turn himself in to the police (there is a lot of heat on 
   the streets), they are repaid with a hail of bullets and one of the 
   forgers is crushed by a car, driven by Louis. Lea goes bonkers, 
   finally realizing that Louis' friends are cold-blooded murders and

    Trying to escape the country, the trio stop their car at the border 
   when they see a roadblock up ahead. Paul keeps Lea close by his side, 
   pretending to be boyfriend and girlfriend, distracting the officers, 
   while Louis and Joe sneak by the roadblock on foot. Once across the 
   border, Paul steals another car and Lea stops him from killing the 
   driver, who runs to the roadblock and tells the officers what just 
   happened. This leads to a lengthy car chase, where Joe cracks wise 
   while the cops chase them, disgusting Lea. Luckily, Louis is a great 
   driver, which Paul notices (paying him a compliment), as the police 
   cars behind them get into wrecks (in spectacular fashion). They stop 
   at a farm to steal another car (Joe says, &quot;Maybe we can steal 
   one of their tractors!&quot;), but they find the farm empty, no car 
   to steal. They hide their current car in a barn while Louis tries to 
   comfort Lea, but she will have none of it, finally realizing that 
   Louis is just as bad as his two new friends. The quartet, unable to 
   find a car, travel by foot through the beautiful countryside, hiding 
   whenever they hear police sirens (The farmer has alerted the 
   Inspector that someone left a car in his barn). Suddenly, a police 
   helicopter appears overhead and Paul makes Lea take off her blouse, 
   jumping on her topless body, making it look like two young lovers 
   having some afternoon nookie. The ruse works and the copter flies 
   away, but the look on Louis' face speaks more than any words can 
   convey (Joe jokingly [?] says, &quot;Maybe he is really going to bang 
   her!&quot;). Lea is thoroughly disgusted with the trio, especially 
   Louis for letting this happen to her (during their fake lovemaking 
   session, we and Louis see Paul fondling Lea's breasts).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Realizing that they haven't eaten in a while, the quartet try to 
   find something that will satisfy their hunger (Joe says, &quot;I'm so 
   hungry I could eat a traffic cop!&quot;). Paul discovers a couple of 
   campers eating and tells his friends that he will ask them for 
   something to eat and if they won't give it to him, he'll take it by 
   force. Louis has had enough and points a gun at Paul, telling him 
   that he and Lea are leaving. Paul tells him to pull the trigger, but 
   Louis can't, because he is really a good guy at heart (Is he 
   really?). The quartet then approach the campers, a big Dutchman named 
   Oberwald (<A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_2.htm#PeterBerling">Peter Berling</A>,
    one of the screenwriters of the great giallo flick <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#RingsOf Fear1978">RINGS
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1978) and his son. When Joe tries to steal some of 
   their food, Oberwald grabs him by the neck and begins to choke him. 
   Paul then murders the father and son, shooting them in the back. Joe 
   is unconscious, so Paul, Louis and Lea leave him behind (some 
   friends, huh?), where one of the police dogs the Inspector has 
   following their trail rips Joe's throat out, killing him. Paul, Louis 
   and Lea meet a forest ranger who has no idea who they are. When the 
   ranger leads them to civilization, Paul pays him for his kindness by 
   shooting him in the back (Paul's preferred method of killing, proving 
   him to be a coward). The Inspector and his men are getting closer to 
   their prey, as they find the dead body of the ranger, still warm. 
   Louis steals another car but, before Lea can get in, he takes off 
   without her, making Paul &quot;proud&quot; of him, yet he still holds 
   a gun to Louis' head as he drives. Lea sits crying in a public 
   bathroom, unaware that Louis has just saved her life. As in most of 
   these Eurocrime films, we know the guilty and even the innocent never 
   get away, without leaving some scars. Louis, who finally realizes the 
   deadly spot he is in, drives the car over a bridge, killing himself 
   and Paul, while Lea continues crying. All the Inspector can do is 
   sigh at the uselessness of it all, the expression on his face telling 
   us that he has seen this same thing more times than he cares to 
   remember. Murder is a coward's way out.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Although nothing spectacular, this is an entertaining potboiler full 
   of nudity and senseless violence. Director Romolo Guerrieri, who also

   to keep our minds off the fact that this film is populated by a bunch 
   of unlikable people, from the trio to their parents, who are more 
   worried more about lawsuits than they are for their sons' lives. This 
   should come as no surprise, since one of the screenwriters is 
   Fernando Di Leo, director of the brutal <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SlaughterHotel1971">SLAUGHTER

   as the main protagonists. There's a reason why Di Leo is called 
   &quot;King of Eurocrime&quot; and one look at this film will tell you 
   why. Stefano Patrizi as Paul is a real charmer. Every time he smiles, 
   someone dies, which makes his character fascinating. Less fascinating 
   is Benjamin Lev as Joe, who makes a joke out of everything, even his 
   death. His character is a cliche, which brings this film down a notch 
   for me. The screenplay was co-written by Nico Ducci, who wrote the 
   screenplay to director Guerrieri's <B><A HREF="covert_action_1978.htm">COVERT
    ACTION</A></B> (1978), but it is easy to see Di Leo did the majority 
   of the writing, as this film contains his &quot;touch&quot; for the 
   dramatic. But this is still an interesting film, full of unexpected 
   deaths, some eye-opening nudity, tense situations and a nihilistic 
   ending, typical for a '70s Eurocrime film. Not that it's a bad thing 
   but because it runs opposite to most American crime films of the '70s

   happened to many people with this disc. I went to Raro's website to 
   see if they offered the .PDF booklet to people who purchased this

   us a physical booklet, but more of their later releases have a .PDF 
   booklet instead, saving them paper and money. I just wish this film 
   had one or the other. There is an extra on the disc, though, an 
   interview with director Romolo Guerrieri, who regales us with info on 
   making this film and why he changed his name (His last name is

    and then proceeds to show a film that sucks so hard, you'll swear it 
   was made by a vacuum cleaner salesman. Kevin Carrigan (James Van 
   Patten) is a frustrated college student who expresses his emotions by 
   making trippy animated films and hazing fraternity pledges by shaving 
   their asses, making them sit bare-assed on a block of ice and 
   attaching bricks to their peckers. His younger sister, Tiffany (April 
   Dawn), is out on a date with high school senior Roger (Nels Van 
   Patten), when their car is run off the road by a street gang in a 
   black van. Roger burns to death in the car, but Tiffany escapes, only 
   to be gang-raped by the gang (she screams &quot;Mommy!&quot; over and 
   over). She ends up in a coma at the hospital and eventually dies 
   while Kevin's policeman father, Lt. Bob Carrigan (Ernest Borgnine), 
   tells him that there's nothing that the police can do until more 
   evidence can be found. Kevin, tired of all the red tape, decides to 
   take the law into his own hands and gets help from friends Fred (Mike 
   Norris), Jorge (John Alden), Stan (Ed De Stefane) and Scott (Tom <A HREF="young_warriors_1983b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/young warriors cannon vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Reilly).
    They go back to the scene of the car crash and find a matchbook (I 
   guess the police are sloppy as well as ineffectual) which leads them 
   to a dive bar in town. It leads nowhere (although the audience is 
   shown one of the gang members was there when Kevin was questioning 
   the bartender) and Kevin becomes more frustrated, venting his anger 
   at a snooty college professor (Dick Shawn). His friends decide that 
   Kevin is right, the police are worthless, so they band together and 
   form a vigilante squad. They stop a car robbery, but they end up 
   arrested, which pisses off Kevin's father and his new partner, Sgt. 
   John Austin (Richard Roundtree). The Young Warriors begin cruising 
   the streets, which is noticed by the street gang, who slit Jorge's 
   throat. They begin cleaning up the streets, collecting guns and other 
   weapons from the people they beat to a pulp. They become so obsessed 
   in their roles as crimefighters that they kill three guys who have 
   kidnapped and raped a girl. The finale finds Kevin and his friends, 
   now nothing but lawless vigilantes, shooting up the dive bar, killing 
   the innocent as well as the guilty and losing most of their lives in 
   the process. Kevin finally wakes up and realizes what he has done and 
   blows himself up with a hand grenade.&nbsp; I can't begin to describe 
   how truly awful and banal this film is, but what else would you 
   expect from director/co-writer Lawrence D. Foldes, who also gave us 
   the mind-numbing horror film <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nightstalker">NIGHTSTALKER</A></B> 
   (1979) and the similarly-themed action film <B><A HREF="#Nightforce">NIGHTFORCE</A></B> 
   (1986). This film is full of scenes that lead nowhere, pointless 
   dialogue scenes between Kevin and his father and badly-staged action 
   scenes that are few and far between. This overlong (103 minutes) film 
   takes forever to get moving, but there are some nude scenes early on 
   by Linnea Quigley, who plays Ginger, and Anne Lockhart, who plays 
   Kevin's girlfriend, Lucy. Ernest Borgnine and Richard Roundtree are 
   wasted in their roles (Borgnine looks totally embarassed and 
   Roundtree disappears before the film is finished) as is Lynda Day 
   George, who plays Kevin's mother. The main problem with this film is 
   there are no real villians to truly hate. The street gang is 
   basically faceless (none of them are even given names) as are all the 
   other crooks, rapists and thieves on view. A good action film usually 
   has at least one bad guy for the audience to hiss at. This one has 
   none. Director Foldes' only bright spot is showing Kevin's spiral 
   into depression as a series of his animated films, which get darker 
   and more alarming as the film progresses. This film also cements the 
   fact that the only talented Van Patten sibling is Timothy (who is now 
   an Emmy-winning TV director), as both James and Nels have the 
   emotional range of a piece of quartz. The violence in this film is 
   limited mainly to gunshot deaths and one guy gets his foot blown off 
   with a shotgun blast. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by, 
   unless you are a masochistic glutton for punishment. Originally known

   Frank Savage (Austin Stoker) and his partner, Detective Marty Wilson 
   (Hugh Smith), are called to a crime scene; a house where three women 
   (two white, one black) are found viciously slashed to death. Also at 
   the scene is a note left by the killer that cryptically says, 
   &quot;One Down 13 To Go&quot; and is signed &quot;MAC&quot;. One girl 
   is found alive hiding under a bed, but she is in such bad<A HREF="zebra_killer_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/zebra killer poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   shape, it will be at least 24 hours before Savage can question her. 
   The killer then plants a bomb in the car of a suburban white family 
   and blows it up, killing Dad, Mom and three young kids, cackling like 
   a madman as the car is engulfed in flames and the kids scream out in 
   their last breaths. Savage finds a note nearby that reads &quot;Two 
   Down 12 To Go&quot;. I think you can see where this is heading. 
   Savage can find no link between the two crime scenes, so he heads to 
   the hospital to question the woman who survived the first massacre 
   (The woman, who is black, says to Savage, &quot;Did they pick you 
   because you are black?&quot; He says to her, &quot;No, baby. They 
   picked me because I'm good!&quot;). The only thing she can tell 
   Savage about the killer is that he is black, has a big afro and has a 
   wicked laugh. After breaking up a fight where a bunch of hookers are 
   beating up their pimp (played by D'Urville Martin, whp wears the same 
   zebra pimp suit in William Girdler's <B><A HREF="sheba_baby_1975.htm">SHEBA,
    BABY</A></B> [1975]), Savage and Wilson are called to the scene 
   where a man had his head caved-in with a sledgehammer, a note painted 
   near the body that says, &quot;Three Down 11 To Go&quot;. A pattern 
   begins to emerge, as all the murdered people were killed with tools 
   from their trades. (The three women, who were nurses, were killed 
   with a scalpel. The family, whose father was a contracter, were 
   killed with explosives. The most recent murder was a man who was a 
   construction worker, killed with a sledgehammer.) Another clue turns 
   up: A synthetic black hair, which means the killer's afro is a wig 
   and he may not be black after all. We soon find out that is true, as 
   the killer murders a cleaning woman (he tosses her down a flight of 
   stairs in her cleaning cart) and is nearly caught by the cops. It 
   turns out that the killer is a raving white lunatic in blackface 
   (played by James Pickett) and he calls Savage and gives him a clue: 
   &quot;November 1971&quot;. What could this possibly mean? Savage 
   better find out quick, because MAC is still on a murder spree. Maybe 
   this riddle will help: What contains twelve people, a lawyer and a 
   judge? Yes, it's a trial and all the people being killed served on 
   one that sent the killer's father to prison (where he was murdered by 
   other prisoners) and MAC is murdering all those involved in sending 
   Dad to jail in retribution. Savage better make the connection quick, 
   as the killer has kidnapped his lady (Valerie Rogers) and the clock 
   is ticking.&nbsp; This is probably the rarest of director William 
   Girdler's short output of 70's exploitation films (nine total) before 
   his life was cut short in 1978 in a helicopter crash while scouting 
   locations for a film in the Philippines. Made in 1973, just before

   having James Pickens (the star of Girdler's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Three Meathook">THREE
    ON A MEATHOOK</A></B> - 1972) dress in blackface (Pickens pulls it 
   off) and spewing-out racial epithets, but it becomes clearer as the 
   film progresses that it's less about race and more about a lunatic 
   who wants to make it seem like his killings are racially motivated 
   when they are, in fact, anything but. Austin Stoker (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HorrorHigh1973">HORROR

   along fine with his new white partner (He says to Marty: &quot;I 
   don't know how to tell you this, but I really think you're 
   black!&quot;) and doesn't get very upset when his fellow cops use the 
   word &quot;nigger&quot; (which is a lot). Maybe that's because he's a 
   pretty lousy cop. Everything he does in this film endangers his 
   partner, witnesses and fellow cops, like refusing help when he really 
   needs it; he never calls for backup, even when he really needs it; he 
   mistakenly shoots at his own partner (not once, but twice in the 
   film!); and he roughs-up an innocent citizen on the street when he 
   simply asks him for a match. It's hard to believe that this film 
   received a PG rating, considering the amount of racially-charged 
   language, subject matter and violence on display. While the 
   bloodletting is kept to a minimum (most of the killings are shown 
   after the fact, although there are bloody bullet squibs every now and 
   then), the overall tone of this film is dark and relentless, but not 
   without some humor, such as the scene of the hookers beating the shit 
   out of their pimp or the appearance of the &quot;city's biggest 
   pimp&quot;, a black midget who steps out of a huge limousine.&nbsp; 
   While <B><A HREF="zebra_killer_1973c.htm">THE ZEBRA KILLER</A></B>

    may be an obscure 70's actioner, it doesn't deserve to be. It's 
   quite entertaining in a way only films from the 70's can be: It's 
   politically incorrect, contains plenty of &quot;wah-wah&quot; guitar 
   on the soundtrack and makes you wish films like this were still being 
   made today. A piece of trivia: Not once is the phrase &quot;Zebra 
   Killer&quot; mentioned in the film. Filmed in Girdler's hometown of 
   Louisville, Kentucky. Also starring Charles Kissinger (the star of 
   Girdler's first film, <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Asylum of Satan">ASYLUM
    OF SATAN</A></B> [1971], who has appeared in nearly all of Girdler's 
   films), Tom Brooks, Ruby Brown, Harriet Knox, Mike Clifford and Don 
   Henderson. I don't believe this ever got an official home video 
   release in the United States. The print I viewed looks to have come 
   from a beat-up 16mm print. <B>Rated PG</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>
