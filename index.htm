    to the Critical Condition web site. For those of you unfamiliar with 
   Critical Condition, let me give a little background. Critical 
   Condition (CritCon for short) was started as a small&nbsp; bi-monthly 
   newsletter in 1982 to alert my friends about the new horror films 
   that were released to theaters. The early 80's were a boon to the 
   horror business as many home-grown and foreign-made horror films <A HREF="dedicated_to_dario_argento.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dario argento artwork small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="261" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="This site is dedicated to Dario Argento.

    being released to theaters every month. Some were good (Lucio 
   Fulci's </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE BEYOND</A></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">;
    Gary Sherman's </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><A HREF="dead_&amp;_buried.htm">DEAD

    but most were bad (Jim Henley's </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><A HREF="junior_1985.htm">JUNIOR</A></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">;
    Bruno Mattei's </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellLivingDead1980">NIGHT
    OF THE ZOMBIES</A></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="NAVY"> and countless 
   others). Being the horror maven that I am (and will always be), I 
   started CritCon to separate the cream from the crap. The first 
   CritCon newsletter was merely one typewritten xeroxed page that I 
   passed out to my friends. By 1985 CritCon had mushroomed into a 20 
   page semi-pro magazine that had a circulation of about 1,000. The 
   year 1985 was a turning point in the horror film business. It was the 
   year that home video became wildly popular and forever changed the 
   way we viewed movies. Cheap horror films were no longer being 
   screened in theaters. Video distributors got wise and started 
   releasing every cheap horror film they could get their hands on. I 
   must have viewed over a thousand horror movies on video in 1985 
   alone! By 1987, I had burned-out writing about all the horror films 
   that I had watched and ceased publishing CritCon with one final 100 
   page issue. By this time&nbsp; there were plenty of other semi-pro 
   magazines on the market that were covering the same market that I 
   was. I took a much-needed rest from the writing game and began to 
   read all these other magazines. For the next five years I kept a low 
   profile but I was also becoming somewhat disillusioned. While some of 
   these magazines flourished and were quite well done (Tim &amp; Donna 
   Lucas' <B><A HREF="http://www.videowatchdog.com">VIDEO WATCHDOG</A> </B>[which
    stopped publishing as a print zine], Mike Accomando's </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><A HREF="dreadful_pleasures_magazine_covers.htm">DREADFUL

    now no longer publishing]), most were merely rants disguising 
   themselves as film reviews. You would be lucky to get the name of the 
   actor who starred in the films they were reviewing. Forget about 
   getting the directing, producing or screenwriting credits because 
   they were non-existant. They seemed more interested in raving about 
   their political views or complaining about some insignificant pimple 
   on their ass. By 1992, I'd had enough and decided to begin publishing 
   Critical Condition on a semi-regular basis. I kept my own politics to 
   a minimum (usually confined to the editorial page) and concentrated 
   on the films and filmmakers themselves. Each issue of CritCon was 
   jam-packed with reviews of films that you probably never heard of 
   along with full cast and crew credits as well as original rare ad 
   mats. CritCon accepted no advertising making it a complete read from 
   the first page to the last. NOTE: After a long and hard look at the 
   publishing business (or the &quot;rip-off business&quot; as I call 
   it), I will no longer be publishing Critical Condition. It will now 
   be completely web-based. I hope you enjoy this web site. If you do 
   (or if you don't), drop me an e-mail and let me know what you think. 
   Check back often to read the new reviews, news, scans and informative 
   emails. NOTE #2: Now with the advent of &quot;Publishing On 
   Demand&quot; there has been a new proliferation of genre zines 
   flooding the market, some excellent and some self-serving. But 
   bringing print back to horror is always a good thing and I wish these 
   people nothing but the best of luck. I buy a lot of these POD zines 
   and enjoy the hell out of them (check out Tim Paxton's <B><A HREF="odds_n_ends.htm#BestZines 2014">MONSTER!</A></B>,
    Brian Harris, Paxton and Tony Strauss' <B><A HREF="odds_n_ends.htm#BestZines 2014">WENG'S
    CHOP</A></B> and Billy &amp; Vanessa Nocera's <B><A HREF="odds_n_ends.htm#BestZines 2014">EVILSPEAK</A></B> 
   to read some of the best new zines on the market [look them up by 
   name on Facebook for ordering information]), but don't look for me to 
   revive <B>CRITICAL CONDITION</B> in print form. I'm a lazy bastard.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

    For all of you that have emailed me asking if I sell the films I 
   review, the answer is NO!!!. I do this for the sheer joy of it and 
   would never think of turning a profit off of something I love so 
   dearly. While most of the films I review are available from reliable 
   distributors, some of the films have been out of circulation for 
   years and will probably never get a legal DVD or Blu-Ray release in 
   the near or distant future. If you do not see a link to a distributor 
   at the end of my reviews, I could probably make you a copy of the 
   film on DVD-R (which will play on most DVD players sold in the last 
   couple of years) if you have films to trade. Email me with your 
   inquiries (I have over 10,500 films in my library) and I'll see what 
   I can do for you. These films are to be distributed from one 
   collector to another (Legal disclaimer). Don't expect crystal clarity 
   as they are being copied from VHS to DVD-R and you may be able to get 
   your hands on a film that you've been dying to see for many years. 
   (Good news: I've completely turned all my VHS tapes to DVD-R, so you 
   can probably get any film you want reviewed on this web site.) Good 
   luck! To see my VHS and DVD library list (it's not complete and badly 
   needs an updating), click <A HREF="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/critconvideos&amp;dvds.xls">HERE</A>.

     29, 2021: Everyone knows how much I love Roku-only channel B-Movie 
    TV, but as I self-isolate in my apartment (don't ask) I come to the 
    conclusion that B-Movie TV is becoming somewhat stale. It has nothing 
    to do with the movies, but with the filler that is shown between 
    movies. How many times can we watch the same cartoon and not become 
    bored with it? Same thing with the music videos (especially those 
    guitar instrumentals by Ethan Brosh). And since 'Madame Burlesque' 
    has become the new spokesperson for the channel, why can't she name 
    the hosted shows properly? It's not &quot;Mary Deth's Horror 
    Night&quot;, it's &quot;Mary Deth's Subbed And Dubbed 
    HorrorFest&quot;. It's not &quot;Midnight Sleazies&quot;, it's 
    &quot;Midnight Sleaze&quot;. And Jake From Slashers Podcast is not 
    only a listening experience, it's also a feast for the eyes, so, 
    yeah, you are stupid. This is pure laziness, plain and simple. Ditch 
    95% of your filler and never, ever bring it back. When boredom sets 
    in, it's hard to get rid of it. I would also ditch Vincent Vlado's 
    convention footage on Saturday mornings because each episode has been 
    played ad nauseum. Same with Cad Adver's Fried Rice Dojo and The 
    Pervy The Clown Show. There hasn't been new episodes in nearly two 
    years. There's hundreds of PD cartoons, movie trailers and music 
    videos on YouTube, so if you are too busy to create new 25-minute 
    filler segments for the channel, ask your fans to create them for 
    you. I'll bet there will be a lot of takers. Oh, and keep Gothic 
    Industry's 'Thrice' and bring back 'Amazing Horse'! </FONT>UPDATE: <FONT COLOR="MAROON">It
     looks like Ken 'Ace' Brewer has listened and agrees with much of 
    what I had to say! The New Year started off with a whole bunch of new 
    filler and even some new films not seen on the channel before. 
    There's changes coming to B-Movie TV.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     21, 2021: The Kyle Rittenhouse verdict of &quot;Not 
    Guilty&quot;&nbsp; on all five counts of murder and attempted murder 
    only shows us how the Trump mentality has infected the judicial 
    system. From a biased judge, who worked the bench as an entertainer 
    would work an audience, to a jurist pool who wouldn't know right from<IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kyle rittenhouse photo1a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="142" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"> 
    wrong even on their best day, this was justice in a communist regime, 
    not in a country where evidence outweighs personal feelings. Remember 
    how shocked we were when Rittenhouse shot and killed two innocent 
    people and wounded a third? Apparently, no one in the courthouse did 
    and let this twisted kid skate on all charges. This wasn't justice, 
    it was a monumental loss of human responsibility. Shame on everyone 
    who had a hand in letting this murderer go free, especially Fox News, 
    who is treating this scumbag as some national hero. I'm sick and 
    tired of this &quot;New Normal&quot;, especially if it means losing 
    your soul in exchange for YouTube and Internet stardom. Rittenhouse 
    wants President Biden to apologize to him for calling him a 
    &quot;White Supremacist&quot;, telling asshole Tucker Carlson that 
    the President defamed his name with &quot;malice&quot;. Are you 
    kidding me? My only hope is that Kyle Rittenhouse spends the rest of 
    his life looking over his shoulder, hoping another him doesn't take

    he wanted to do was make people laugh. I happened to love Norm's 
    sense of humor. His dry delivery would make me laugh out loud, even 
    though some people were known to not like his sense of humor at all. 
    I think he was the best Weekend Update anchor on <A HREF="saturday_night_live_tv_series_1975.htm">SATURDAY
     NIGHT LIVE</A> (from 1994 - 1997), as he was able to cover the O.J. 
    Simpson trial and the Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton sex scandal with 
    acerbic humor, most of it improvised. His spot-on impersonation of 
    Burt Reynolds in those SNL Jeopardy skits were some of my favorite 
    moments on the show. It was said he was fired from SNL in 1998 
    because of his off-the-cuff remarks about O.J. Simpson, as one of the 
    corporate bigwigs (Fred Silverman) at NBC was good friends with 
    Simpson. But Norm turned that episode in his life into a positive, 
    not a negative, as he did stand-up concerts, starred in movies and TV 
    Series and became a well-respected voiceover artist on many animated 
    TV shows and films (He would eventually return to SNL as a host [and 
    as Burt Reynolds] in 2009). Norm was also well-versed in politics and 
    would become a guest on many political TV shows, using his sense of 
    humor as a weapon against political chicanery. Goodbye Norm 
    MacDonald. You were a welcomed breath of fresh air in a world of 
    stagnant pollution. I will miss you greatly.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    are and not slap them on the wrist when they are judged by a court of 
    law. These two recent dates in history will be in the history books

    ratings [it was still a popular show], but because Asner's political

    political and humanitarian activist, which earned him a lot of 
    distain from his rivals (Asner was a staunch liberal Democrat). He 
    also served as President of The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) for two

    Asner always was acting in other projects, be it TV series, TV Movies 
    or theatrical films. He was the consummate actor. He won an amazing 
    seven Emmy Awards from the years 1971 to 1980, the most of any male 
    actor on TV (the late <A HREF="#ClorisLeachmanRIP">Cloris Leachman</A>

    '80s &amp; '90s working on television, either in TV Movies, busted TV

    series, where his voice was very much in demand. His gravelly voice

    as&nbsp; &quot;Takuma 'Terry' Tsurugi&quot; in the ultra-violent <A HREF="streetfighter_1974.htm">THE
     STREET FIGHTER</A> (1974), which was the first film to be slapped 
    with an X-Rating by the MPAA just for violence (Or as the MPAA 
    described it: &quot;This film unsuitable for viewers under the age of 
    17 because of its extraordinary fight sequences.&quot;) Later on, New 
    Line Cinema edited out 16 minutes of violent footage so it could be 
    released to theaters with an R-Rating. This was an unqualified hit in 
    theaters, even with its X-Rating and two sequels quickly followed: <A HREF="streetfighter_1974.htm">RETURN
     OF THE STREET FIGHTER</A> (1974) and <A HREF="streetfighter_1974.htm">THE

     STREET FIGHTER</A> (1974) is not a sequel, as Chiba doesn't portray 
    Terry Tsurugi. New Line Cinema renamed the film to ride on the 
    success of the three films that came before it (and it worked). 
    Suddenly Chiba's other films became very successful across the world 
    and especially in America. Titles such as <A HREF="karate_bullfighter_1975.htm">KARATE

     21, 2021: Is it possible we jumped the gun by allowing everyone who 
    was vaccinated for Covid-19 to move freely around the world maskless? 
    Not only are many TV Series and Films being shut down temporarily due 
    to Covid infections on set, but atheletes from around the world are 
    being infected at the Tokyo Olympics and are either being quarantined 
    or sent home. We have also discovered that getting<A HREF="vaccines_save_lives_2021.htm"><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vaccines save lives image2b.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="254" HEIGHT="143" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    the two vaccinations does not stop people who had the shots from 
    getting Covid, even if they have had it before and it does not stop 
    them from infecting people who haven't had the shots (idiotic as 
    these people may be). Granted, those who have been vaccinated and 
    catch the virus, don't suffer the most dire symptoms as those who 
    weren't vaccinated, but it doesn't stop them from infecting others. 
    Until the majority of the population around the globe are vaccinated, 
    we should be careful who we come in contact with. Getting vaccinated 
    is only the first step in wiping out Covid, the rest is pure common 
    sense. Stay away from people who haven't been vaccinated (yet try to 
    get them to see the light and tell them that the Covid vaccine is not 
    a government conspiracy) and if they refuse to get the shots, stay 
    away from them permanently. No matter how good they are as friends, 
    it is not worth killing people over. The Delta variant of Covid is 
    just one new strain out there, so be vigilant and, most of all, be 
    careful and use your brain when you come in contact with people. And 
    for God's sake, get vaccinated and wear your masks when coming in 
    contact with a group of people, either indoors or outdoors! Better 
    safe than sorry. We are not out of the woods yet and I would hate to 
    experience another pandemic, yet all these Karens and SovCits 
    (Soverign Citizens) think they are above the law and threaten to 
    destroy not only the United States, but the entire planet. Remember: 
    People Are Stupid and their stupidity has no bounds. They only care 
    about themselves. It's only a matter of time before the governments 
    of the world recognize how dangerous they are and do something about 
    them (At least I hope they do. Charging them with involuntary 
    manslaughter is a good first step.). Believe in science, not 
    political conspiracy theories that Republicans are dishing out to 
    their uneducated and feeble-minded followers.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    favorite '80s action films, as bad guy Striker in <A HREF="eye_of_the_tiger_1986.htm">EYE

    (1965 - 1967); appeared as &quot;Adonis&quot; on the last episode of <A HREF="batman_1966.htm">BATMAN</A>

    (1979 - 1980). Since Bill has over 270 film and TV credits, it would 
    be impossible to list them all (go to IMDb for that), but since he 
    spoke over five languages (Fluent in Russian, German, French and

    releasing nearly fifty albums in his career, including a <A HREF="metropolis_1927_ronnie_cramer_soundtrack_album.htm">new

    let's quit thinking that all films should be Disneyfied. Only time 
    will tell if this will be a good deal. I'm hoping it is. This deal

    varied career in television and film, he made precious few movies 
    that would fit the criteria of this site, but he does have a handful. 
    I loved Mr. Grodin for his appearances on Johnny Carson's Tonight 
    Show and David Letterman's Late Night (and Late Show), where he would 
    adopt a character that was verbally combative at every question asked 
    of him, as if he was pissed to be there. He was not only 
    wet-your-pants funny, he was usually right on target with his answers 
    and both Carson and Letterman loved that, inviting him back countless 
    times over the years. As far as Charles Grodin's genre film roles are 
    concerned, he first appeared as an uncredited child in Disney's <A HREF="20,000_leagues_under_the_sea_1954.htm">20,000
     LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA</A> (1954) and spent the rest of the '50s &amp;
     '60s appearing on Television. His career began to take off when he 
    appeared as a doctor in Roman Polanski's <A HREF="rosemarys_baby_1968.htm">ROSEMARY'S
     BABY</A> (1968), followed by <A HREF="catch-22_1970.htm">CATCH-22</A>

    when it first happened on April 2nd, they were quick to mention he 
    was hospitalized due to a drug overdose that caused his cardiac 
    arrest. Thousands of people attended a vigil for a comatose DMX 
    outside the hospital in NYC he was in, praying for him to get better 
    and not once during that vigil were drugs ever mentioned. Is this the 
    message we want to send our children? The death of DMX is certainly a 
    tragedy, but we cannot leave out the truth as to the cause of his

     made nearly $50 million in its first five days, the most a film has 
    made in a theatrical release in the U.S. since before the pandemic 
    started). I have to say that I enjoyed the film immensely, as it hit 
    most of the right notes and managed to pay tribute to both <A HREF="godzilla_saga_japan_posters_1954-2016.htm">King
     Kong and Godzilla films</A> of the past. While the film mainly pays 
    attention to Kong throughout most of the film, the battles between 
    Kong and Godzilla were done very well, be it the first attack 
    underwater or the battle they have in Hong Kong, completely 
    destroying it. But when Mecha-Godzilla makes an appearance (that's 
    the only spoiler you are going to get from me) the battle changes 
    completely and it had me applauding on my couch in approval and I 
    even got choked-up a little. A Kaiju film that does that to me can't 
    be all bad, so if you are sitting on the fence whether to watch it or 
    not, I say go for it, you will probably like it. There are some 
    clich&eacute;s here (A small deaf girl is friends with Kong and the 
    human baddie has intent on ruling the world), but they are easily 
    overlooked because this film does nearly everything else beautifully, 
    from the remarkable CGI (yes, I'm praising it!), the wonderful 
    scenery of Hollow Earth (Man, I wish it did exist!) to the epic 
    battle sequences. And it doesn't overstay its welcome, as it runs 
    less than two hours (unlike the <A HREF="godzilla_2014.htm">three</A> <A HREF="kong_skull_island_2017.htm">other</A> <A HREF="godzilla_king_of_the_monsters_2019.htm">films</A> 
    in the Monsterverse series, which went way over the two hour mark, or 
    at least it seemed they did). So does Kong or Godzilla die in this 
    (Director Adam Wingard [<A HREF="youre_next_2011.htm">YOU'RE NEXT</A>

     01, 2021: The CPAC Republican convention proves to me that 
    Republicans want to overthrow Democracy in the United States. Not 
    only did they create a giant gold statue of Trump (Made in Mexico!), 
    they also allowed the ex-President to give a rambling 90-minute 
    speech where he once again repeated his lies about winning the 
    election, but he and his fellow Communists also put down Dr. Fauci 
    and President Biden, while telling everyone that the COVID-19 
    pandemic was a hoax (A half-a-million Americans dead is a hoax? How 
    stupid do you have to be?), every Republican in the conference 
    applauding, hootin' and hollerin' in approval at every single lie 
    that came out of their mouths. This just proves one thing to me: Do 
    we want people like this running our country and making the most 
    important decisions of our lives? I mean, we already put up with four 
    years of lies and misinformation, do we need any more? If it weren't 
    for the millions of uneducated people who swallow up these lies and 
    believe they are the truth, these seditious idiots would have been 
    kicked out of office a long time ago. When any Republican Governor, 
    Senator or House Representative comes up for re-election, vote for 
    the other guy or gal. Send a message to them that we are sick and 
    tired of being fed lies and we are smart enough to distinguish the 
    truth from outright false conspiracy theories. And to those millions 
    of uneducated assholes who believe this ten pounds of shit in a five 
    pound bag, all I have to say is this: grow up and take pride in your 
    country. The pride you have now is nothing but treasonous behavior 
    wrapped in a lie that you swallowed without hesitation. Use your 
    brain (if you know how). And one other thing: Support President 
    Biden. He has the empathy that Trump failed to convey at every turn. 
    He's not perfect, but he is a million times more productive than that 
    idiot former President! This is the first time in my 63 years on this 
    planet that a proven dictator is trying to take over the United 
    States of America and idiotic people are feeding off his lies. I 
    wouldn't worry so much if it was just a tiny percentage of the 
    population believing his lies, but we are talking over seventy 
    million people who voted for him in the last election. It's time for 
    action, any legal action to stop this from happening, but we know 
    from experience that these treasonous people don't care about laws. 
    They will do anything, including murder, to get their way. I always 
    say, &quot;People Are Stupid&quot;, but I should change that to, 
    &quot;People Are Stupidly Dangerous.&quot; It's up to us intelligent, 
    freedom-loving citizens to stop this insurrection from destroying our 
    Democracy. I don't know about you, but I have no problem stooping to 
    their level to make sure this never happens. If that's all they 
    understand, so be it.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     15, 2021: After stewing in my own juices for the past two days, I 
    have to voice my disgust for all the Republican Senators who voted to 
    acquit Donald Trump of impeachment. They spit on the Constitution 
    while saying the Constitution dictates that it is illegal to impeach 
    a President who is no longer in office. Bullshit! Show me where in 
    the Constitution it says that; the fact is it doesn't exist and was 
    mearly a weak excuse used by these spineless bastards because they 
    don't want to admit that they are afraid of the former President and 
    many of them were just as guilty as he was for the insurrection at 
    the Capitol Building on January 6th. By supporting this treasonous 
    idiot who nearly took down our Democracy, it has proven to me one 
    important thing: These Republican Senators should be banned from 
    politics forever. They don't support their sworn duty to protect 
    Democracy and the American way of life; they support the exact 
    opposite. Remember every one of them when they come up for 
    re-election, especially the two-faced Mitch McConnell, who is nothing 
    but pond scum (sorry, pond scum, I didn't mean to debase you), 
    delivering a speech after the impeachment that proved what a 
    bold-faced liar he actually is. With these treasonous bastards in the 
    Senate, nothing will get done that doesn't put more money in their 
    pockets and sets-up Trump for another term as President in 2024. Up 
    next: Trump facing criminal charges for what he did during his 
    Presidency. This won't be so easy for him since politics don't play a 
    role in criminal justice (at least it shouldn't). We'll see. The 
    common citizens who still support him are beyond the pale. Can't they 
    see he doesn't give a damn about them? Their blind committment to 
    Trump is what led to the murderous insurrection in the first place. I 
    always think that people are stupid, but to be this stupid even makes 
    me shake my head in disgust. America is in turmoil, but I hope that 
    President Biden handles it in a way that is fair and just. It looks 
    like that is happening right now, but the future offers many surprises.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     08, 2021:<A NAME="GiuseppeRotunnoRIP"></A> Yes, you guessed it, 
    another death to report, this time famed Italian cinematographer 
    Giuseppe Rotunno, who passed away yesterday of unknown causes at the 
    age of 97. You may not be familiar with the name, but I am sure you 
    have seen many of the films he photographed, as he not only shot 
    Italian films, but many International and American films, too. Mr. 
    Rotunno had a certain style that added atmosphere and intensity to 
    the many films he photographed, including <A HREF="on_the_beach_1959.htm">ON

    including many of Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini's films. I'm 
    sure you have seen at least one of these films and can understand the 
    certain style Giuseppe Rotunno added to it, using non-standard camera 
    angles and other strange set-ups to his films (especially when it 
    came to lighting a scene), giving them a sense of urgency and a lot 
    of class. In 1966, he became the first non-American cinematographer 
    to be accepted as a member of American Society of Cinematographers 
    (ASC), mainly because of his trademark style. He retired from 
    filmmaking in 1997 and taught cinematography at a film school in 
    Rome. Thanks for giving us your special brand of entertainment, 
    Giuseppe Rotunno, something we can enjoy for an eternity.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    the films they appeared in to keep us entertained. Mr. Sabato left 
    acting in 2006 after appearing in several episodes of an American 
    soap opera (!), but I never forgot about him thanks to my love for 
    Italian genre films. Mr. Sabato was 77 years-old. Rest well, Antonio 
    Sabato, and never forget that you have fans down here who admire your 
    work. Only nine days into this New Year and it is already turning out 
    nothing but bad news. It doesn't give me much hope that the rest of 
    the year will be any different.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     06, 2021:<A NAME="TrumpTreason2021"></A> Never in my life did I 
    think I would regret being an American, but today made me think 
    otherwise. The actions by Donald Trump and his followers in 
    Washington D.C. are nothing short of treasonous behavior. With 
    Trump's permission, thousands of his followers gathered and rioted at 
    the Capitol Building to violently protest the disproven 
    time-and-time-again &quot;fradulent&quot; Presidential election, 
    which resulted in one innocent woman (turns out she wasn't as 
    innocent as we first thought) being shot and killed by police after 
    illegally storming inside the Capitol Building. President-elect Biden 
    called on Trump to tell his followers to cease and desist, but 
    Trump's response was a one-minute rant where he told his followers to 
    &quot;go home&quot; and &quot;I love you&quot; and then railed 
    against the fixed election, giving his followers a very mixed 
    message. If Trump doesn't face severe criminal charges for this 
    murderous stunt, then there is no justice in this country. He has 
    proven himself to be anti-democracy, so let's give him a taste of 
    what democracy does to any person who incites a riot where people are 
    killed. Instead of a taste, we should give him a seven course meal in 
    democracy justice. And while we are at it, let us also charge all the 
    Republicans who tried to void Biden's elections results by trying to 
    block the Congress from certifying the election, especially in the 
    States that Trump swore he won. The delusions by these Republicans 
    and Trump have ruined this country for a long, long time and was only 
    done because Trump doesn't like to lose (his actions reminds me of a 
    child who is being punished for lying) and his Republican cronies are 
    too afraid to go against him (although a few Republicans have vocally 
    supported Biden, but not enough of them). It's also going to make it 
    tough going for Biden when he takes office on January 20th, but if 
    anyone can straighten out this total mess, it is him. Unfortunately, 
    this is not a time to talk about films, but a time to put Trump in 
    his place. A prison would be perfect. A firing squad would be better 
    (after he is found guilty of treason in federal court). Trump thinks 
    he is made of teflon. Let's prove him wrong.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    was also known for his role as &quot;Zeus&quot;, a wrestler on WWE

     20, 2020:<A NAME="Non-MaskWearers"></A> As the pandemic rages on 
    across the world to very serious and deadly levels, I have to address 
    a certain group of people in my country who refuse to wear masks. You 
    are fucking idiots, as well as murderers! You think this Covid-19 
    pandemic is a hoax? Then you are simply fooling yourselves and 
    committing murder for your psychotic beliefs! I only hope that people 
    like you (including &quot;Mark K.&quot;, a former member of a certain 
    Canadian collective) are arrested for manslaughter when you are 
    tested for the virus and come up positive.&nbsp; You may not feel 
    sick, but that doesn't mean you are not passing on the virus to 
    people just for the simple reason you are not wearing a mask. You can 
    have your insane beliefs (saying things like &quot;Wearing a mask is 
    against my First Amendment Rights and my liberty as a U.S. 
    citizen!&quot;), but not when it comes to infecting other people, 
    which could lead to their deaths. I caught the virus from such a 
    person in June and I am still suffering from the effects of the 
    virus, even though now I no longer am infected and have tested 
    negative for it. As Mark K. once said to me in a Facebook post, 
    &quot;If I can blow smoke through a mask, what's the use of me 
    wearing one?&quot;, totally ignoring the basic reasoning for wearing 
    masks in the first place. If everyone wore them, the pandemic would 
    be long over, asswipes! It's not just you wearing a mask, it's 
    infecting everyone you come in contact with (they also ignore the 
    &quot;six feet apart&quot; recommendation), which then has a domino 
    effect. You may be able to blow cigarette smoke through a mask, but 
    if you were wearing a mask like everyone else, your chances of 
    infecting anyone are greatly reduced (Mark K. also believes that 9-11 
    was a government conspiracy, telling me that a large shipment of 
    plastic explosives were left in the Twin Towers the day before the 
    two planes hit it, which is why both towers crumbled to the ground! 
    It just proves to me he is not in his right mind, but there are 
    plenty of idiots who believe him, which makes him dangerous.). My 
    hope is this: Don't wear a mask + test positive for virus = time in 
    prison for manslaughter. Fuck your First Amendment Rights and your 
    liberty, you are killing people! Maybe a few years in prison will 
    make you see the light, but you will go down in the history books as 
    people who killed thousands upon thousands of people just for 
    refusing to wear a mask. You don't deserve pity, you deserve all the 
    scorn that is coming to you.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    that Biden will treat everyone equally, whether they voted for him or 
    not. He is a much better man than me. If I had my way, I would have 
    all of Trump's supporters go back to school and learn what being a 
    true patriot really means. It's not carrying guns and rifles to vote 
    counting centers or shooting innocent people because they think Black 
    Lives Matter, it's about making America a better country than it was 
    before. That includes treating everyone equal no matter their skin 
    color, religious convictions or sexual preferences. When you start 
    understanding that, you will become a better person. That is what 
    America is really about! Emotionally, I'm a complete mess and it was 
    beginning to affect me physically, too. Now let's get back to what 
    this web site is really about: MOVIES!!!</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     06, 2020:<A NAME="KickTrumpOut"></A> Donald J. Trump is a worm of 
    the highest order, still trying to destroy this country with his 
    blatant lies and refusal to submit to the will of the people. He is 
    incapable of understanding how to lose gracefully and will spout lies 
    until his contemptuous inbred hillbilly followers brandish weapons 
    and storm vote counting buildings shouting &quot;Stop Counting 
    Now!&quot;, knowing full well that counting these mail-in votes are 
    the law of the land and they are only in place due to Trump's 
    criminal mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic. There would hardly be 
    any mail-in voting if people weren't scared to vote in person, afraid 
    of contacting the virus from Trump supporters, who refuse to wear 
    masks because, in Trump's words, &quot;It's a hoax&quot; (Even though 
    we also know that was a lie when he spouted it, as proven by his 
    recorded phone tapes to the Washington Post reporter). Trump is also 
    scared of spending the rest of his life in prison, not only for 
    defaulting on hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars in 
    loans, but also for the treasonous way he and his Republican cronies 
    have treated the United States to such favorite Trump dictators such 
    a Vladimir Putin and that short scuzzy-looking dictator from North 
    Korea, Kim Jong-un (Trump wanted to rule the U.S. like they ruled 
    their countries). Sorry, you orange-skinned bastard, the majority of 
    the people are done with your deadly nonsense and want you to leave 
    office come January 21st, 2021. If not, expect an armed escort to 
    take you out of office, either willingly or kicking and screaming, 
    yelling for your dead father to reach out and save you, like he did 
    hundreds of times when he was alive, bailing you out of legal trouble 
    for your failed business dealings. You see, America is not a 
    business, it is a democratic government. People only elected you 
    (barely) because they wanted to see how a businessman and a 
    &quot;celebrity&quot; and not a politician would run our country. Now 
    that we know, we can't wait for you to leave office and leave this 
    country, as you have repeatedly said you would should you lose. 
    Goodbye, loser. Don't let the doors hit you in the ass on the way 
    out. Now you will know how it feels to be an &quot;illegal alien&quot;
     when Putin welcomes you into his country (I can think of no other 
    country [besides the aforementioned North Korea] that would accept 
    him, as he will be broke and destitute. Oh, well, he could always 
    write another book [via ghost writer, because I doubt he can write a 
    single sentence on his own] that will also be full of lies.). I hope

    Presidential election turns out, I need to say something that is 
    important to me. The year 2020 has been the worst year in my 63 years 
    on this planet, thanks to the horrifying way Trump has treated the 
    United States and the people who live in it, so </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">IF
     YOU ARE A TRUMP SUPPORTER AND/OR BELIEVE IN THE STUPID THINGS QANON 
    SAYS, YOU ARE NO LONGER WELCOME ON THIS WEBSITE!</FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> 
    I know this really doesn't matter to you, because I cannot stop 
    anyone from reading this site (unless I make it password protected, 
    something I would never do), but Trump supporters and Qanon followers 
    are destroying this country. I know I usually shut down any mention 
    of Hitler or the Nazis whenever having a conversation with anyone, 
    but the parallels between Hitler's rise in Germany and Trump's rise 
    in America are remarkable. Hitler was able to convince much of 
    Germany's population that those with non-Aryan blood were inferior 
    and must be eliminated, which led to the worst massacre of Jews or 
    anyone with Jewish blood in them in modern history. Germany is still 
    reeling from this over eighty years later and for good reason. Trump 
    is basically doing the same thing in America, calling all 
    &quot;illegal aliens&quot;, especially Mexicans and Muslims, 
    &quot;murderers&quot;, &quot;rapists&quot; and &quot;pedophiles&quot;,
     taking their children away from them, locking the young kids in 
    metal cages and ruining their lives forever. Trump's supporters have 
    shot and killed innocent people simply because they believe Black 
    Lives Matter and Trump supports all this, even refusing to condemn 
    racism and racist militia groups (I don't want to name them because 
    it only gives them validity by doing so) because they support him. 
    Trump supporters are even forming roadblocks to voting places so they 
    cannot vote Democratic and they even stand outside voting booths 
    threatening voters if they will not tell them who they are voting 
    for. If Trump wins a second term (deriding mail-in voting, incapable 
    of understanding that his criminal mishandling of the Covid-19 
    pandemic is why we need mail-in voting!), it will be the end of the 
    U.S.A. and I think everyone sees that, but people are stupid and 
    follow a man who is incapable of telling the truth. Every word that 
    comes out of his mouth is a lie and if he repeats it enough, these 
    feeble-minded inbred rednecks, with nothing to look forward to in 
    their miserable lives, start to believe him and praise him for his 
    racist values. His supporters are the new Nazis and I cannot in good 
    conscience abide by that, so if you are one of these despicable 
    people, please do not support this site as I hate you with all my 
    heart and soul. I believe in facts, something you never seem to 
    understand (I had one member [who shall remain nameless] of the 
    Canadian collective &quot;The Internet Astronauts&quot; call me a 
    pedophile [which seems to be a codeword for &quot;Qanon 
    believer&quot;] because I disagreed with him about Covid-19 being a 
    hoax and there was no need to wear a mask because a smoker could 
    could blow smoke through it! He ignored all the other valid points 
    about why wearing a mask is beneficial to everyone's health, which 
    includes keeping a six foot distance away from everyone when out in 
    public. Idiots like him seem to think they are more knowledgeable 
    than scientists or doctors!). Trump supporters are what is keeping 
    Covid-19 alive, as their refusal to wear masks and throwing huge 
    parties are what is killing thousands of people weekly. I know I am 
    going to catch a lot of flak for this, but my doctor (whom I trust 
    with my life, unlike most Trump supporters) told me if I didn't find 
    a reasonable outlet to release my anger (I've been keeping it inside 
    for most of the year), my life would be over very soon. I have 
    survived two bouts of leukemia, broke my back when I was younger 
    (which led to a lifetime of painful inoperable back pain) and had a 
    growth removed from my neck that led to months of rehabilitation to 
    learn how to speak again, but that is all child's play when compared 
    to the year 2020. I love my country and will do anything to return it 
    back to its former glory, but stupid people are ruining it with their 
    constant beliefs in unprovable conspiracy theories and racist 
    attitudes. If you are one of these people and are friends with me on 
    Facebook, please delete me, because I have nothing but contempt for 
    you. I'm done with you for now, but it's not over by a longshot. I'd 
    like to thank all who believe in me and who have supported me through 
    these very tough times. One of the reasons I haven't posted any new 
    reviews recently is because of the state of mind Trump and his 
    supporters have put me (and many, many others) in, but, hopefully, 
    that will end very soon. If not, I will find a way to survive. I 
    always do.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     new policy is, I was watching a two minute movie trailer and YouTube

    would they do that? I'll tell you why: They know that most people are 
    trapped in their homes during this pandemic and they know their 
    audience is captive, so they ram commercials down our throats. This 
    is not only annoying, it's downright insane! I'm calling for a freeze 
    on YouTube, just to show them that we are not going to take it any 
    more. People have said to me, &quot;Fred, but they are only

    YouTube forces channels to edit their films of nudity and violence, 
    under fear that, if they don't, YouTube will terminate their channel 
    permanently (They have done it to many of my favorite channels, some

    computer! There are also several sub-programs that run in the 
    background that search your hard drive so they can send you ads that 
    caters to your taste. It is the most intrusive, privacy-stealing

    but don't you let me find you not wearing a mask in public, 
    especially when other people are nearby. I'll punch your lights out 
    because you are putting many innocent people's lives at risk. Being 
    one who survived the virus, I can tell you it wasn't easy and I 
    wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, but if you are stupid enough to 
    go outside or into public places without wearing a mask, because you 
    don't &quot;believe&quot; in them (or some other asinine excuse), 
    expect someone to tap you on the shoulder. That will be the last 
    thing you remember for hours (after I sanitize my hands for touching 
    and knocking you on your ass). It's time we all started acting like 
    thinking, breathing human beings who actually care about each other, 
    not Trumpeteers who care for nothing except themselves. Stop acting 
    like idiots! Full Disclosure: I caught the virus when videotaping a 
    Black Lives Matter rally in my town. I always wear a mask when 
    outside, but there were some Trump supporters protesting against the 
    rally. And none of them were wearing masks. When I passed by them, a 
    few of them tried to grab my camera away from me, telling me I had no 
    permission to film them, causing me to push their skanky, disease-ridden
     bodies off me. It's the only way I could have caught the virus 
    because I am always careful about what I do.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    that I report that music soundtrack master Ennio Morricone passed 
    away today at the age of 91. Mr. Morricone taught everyone that a 
    proper music score actually enhanced the film experience, as he 
    scored over 500 films. Everyone has their favorite Morricone score, 
    from <A HREF="good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_1966.htm">THE GOOD, THE BAD 
    AND THE UGLY</A> (1966) to John Carpenter's <A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE

    to Quentin Tarantino's <A HREF="hateful_eight_2015.htm">THE HATEFUL EIGHT</A> 
    (2015). My favorite Morricone music score was for Sergio Leone's <A HREF="duck_you_sucker_1971.htm">DUCK
     YOU SUCKER</A> (a.k.a. <A HREF="fistful_of_dynamite_1971.htm">A 
    FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE</A> - 1971), which was one of the most romantic 
    music scores my ears ever heard. I watch this film at least once a 
    year and the score never fails to tug at my heart. Mr. Morricone was 
    nominated for an Academy Award&reg; another five times and was 
    awarded an Academy Award Honorary Award&reg; in 2007 &quot;for his 
    magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film 
    music&quot;, which was well deserved. His contributions to film 
    scoring were unsurpassed. He always managed to give the film music he 
    scored a &quot;hook&quot; that would become earworms to all film and 
    music lovers and he worked on many films (especially the giallo films 
    reviewed on this site) that were made memorable by his music scores. 
    He scored everything from A-list Hollywood films to many Italian 
    genre films that most people would consider &quot;minor&quot; (but 
    not by me). Everything he touched was greatly improved by his music. 
    I could go on and on about Mr. Morricone's film scores, but I'll 
    leave that for his obituary, which I am working on at this moment. We 
    lost a musical genius today and the world will never be the same, 
    especially when it comes to film music scores. Rest In Peace, Ennio Morricone.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    are these short commercials intrusive, they appear without any rhyme

    but they are becoming much worse than Network TV with their 
    commercials. Sure, they are shorter, but they are just as bothersome, 
    if not more so, than the longer commercials on Network TV, because 
    they appear much more frequently (Do the math: Fifteen commercial 
    interruptions in a 90-minute film!). YouTube, get your act together

    reviews for, be it Animation, Comedy and films about Sports. He also 
    writes about films in genres I do cover, including Horror, Action, 
    Sci-Fi, Martial Arts and Westerns, but they are films that I would 
    never think of reviewing for reasons only known to me and Steven 
    (It's hard, if not downright impossible, to find a person on the same 
    wavelength you are on. Steven and I share the same wavelength. I 
    consider him a brother that I never knew I had!). Steven has a 
    &quot;voice&quot; unlike any writer today and if you don't laugh when 
    reading his reviews, then you, my friend, have no sense of humor at 
    all. I would like to welcome Steven to Critical Condition. He adds

    the George Floyd murder. It reminds me of what happened after 9-11, 
    when songs were banned from radio, movies showing the World Trade 
    center were taken off TV and people were scared for their lives, 
    blaming all Muslims for the crimes. Different circumstances, same 
    mindset. I don't believe defunding the police or even going as far as 
    to delete police departments from cities is the answer, because, 
    believe me, there are criminal elements out there who live for these 
    situations and will take advantage of them. No police means 
    lawlessness. And lawlessness means more loss of lives. Let's train 
    our police officers to be a little (or a lot) more racially

    by the unnecessary death of George Floyd? People have been cooped up 
    in their houses for two months and this one single violent action 
    caused them to leave their homes and protest. Yes, some of the 
    protests have turned violent and I blame that on people who are using 
    this as an excuse to loot and pillage. They always come out during 
    times like this, but this is actually a once-in-a-lifetime experience 
    for this planet. People have to remember that COVID-19 is still not 
    on the wane and their protests may bring a spike in the virus for a 
    second round. I have seen many protesters not wearing masks and that 
    is wrong. This isn't fake, as the President and the Republican 
    majority wants you to believe, this is real and many innocent people 
    are dying from this virus. If you are going to protest the death (or, 
    more realistically, the murder) of George Floyd, please remember that 
    the person next to you not wearing a mask may have the virus and when 
    you go home, you will spread it to your family and friends. This 
    virus doesn't attack indiscriminately, it affects everyone, so please 
    be careful and wear a mask when you are outside. This way, everyone 
    is protected. The last thing we need is the protests causing more 
    unnecessary deaths. Also, please remember that not all police are as 
    violent and unfeeling as the one who put the knee on Mr. Floyd's 
    neck. The vast majority of them are actually doing it for the sake of 
    the innocent. They care about people. But, I still defend the right 
    to protest, because, as they say: &quot;To be silent is to be complicit.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     29, 2020: A big &quot;FUCK YOU!!!&quot; to YouTube for forcibly 
    inserting commercials during any program you watch. I'm use to seeing 
    commercials before or after a program, but to insert them willy-nilly 
    during any film or short-form program you may be watching is 
    inexcusable, making YouTube no better than network or basic cable TV. 
    There seems to be no rhyme or reason in their insertion of 
    commercials. I was watching a 12-minute <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBnbnH7DGXT9yBBVFbZeIwQ">Nuke's
     Top 5</A> paranormal program and it was interrupted 3 times for 
    commercials! And any film I may watch on YT is interrupted at least a 
    dozen times. I know programs like YouTube are privately owned 
    companies, but their greed and passion for making money off the backs 
    of honest people just trying to entertain us is beyond the pale. A 
    few people have told me that they haven't experienced it yet, so this 
    may be a pilot program, but, even if it is, there is no need to force 
    commercials on anyone, earning YouTube a second big FUCK YOU!!! And 
    here's another big eff you to YouTube for permanently deleting 
    long-standing channels such as &quot;Giallo Realm&quot;, 
    &quot;Eurocrime Realm&quot; and &quot;Horror Realm&quot;. Why delete 
    the channels permanently? If they are showing films they don't have a 
    license to, block those, but don't completely delete the channel! 
    That's putting the cart before the horse. I use to enjoy YouTube, but 
    now it's becoming too much of a chore to endure. And it's not gone 
    unnoticed by me that they did it during the COVID-19 pandemic, fully 
    knowing that they have a captive audience. Bad medicine, YouTube, bad medicine.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     28, 2020: After several months of posting nothing but short DTV 
    reviews, due to my internet connection being spotty because everyone 
    is working from home, I'm glad to report that I have finally posted 
    my first full-length review, this one being for the film <A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Specters1987">SPECTERS</A> 
    (1987)! My internet connection has been stable for the past week, 
    giving me the impetus to start posting new reviews every other day. I 
    have at least fifty new full-length reviews that need to be posted, 
    since I never stopped writing reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. I 
    literally have two 150-page notebooks full of new handwritten 
    reviews, all of them for Euro or Italian genre films, some you may 
    have heard of and a lot you haven't! I'm a little rusty at this, so 
    please be patient with me as I get myself re-acclimated to posting 
    long reviews again. And, as always, thanks to my veteran readers for 
    sticking with me. I know it wasn't easy during this time of 
    uncertainty, but I appreciated your emails, especially when they are 
    full of information that may have skipped my attention. So thanks, 
    Steven, Michael, William (Bill) and everyone else out there that took 
    the time to write me. Oh, and this message is for Edward J. McKenney: 
    Thanks for your postcard, but I don't have a DVD catalogue to send 
    you! I never take money for any film I review. It keeps me grounded 
    and honest.&nbsp; I do have a library of films that just passed the 
    7,000 mark, but none of those films are for sale. I'm a collector and 
    always will be! It's both a gift and a curse. Any collector can 
    understand that. I will continue posting shorter DTV reviews, but not 
    with the regularity that I have been doing for the past few months. 
    In other words, I'm back to normal business, baby!</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     25, 2020: A very special Happy Birthday to one of my favorite people 
    in this entire fucked-up world, <A HREF="ken_ace_brewer_photo_2020.htm">Ken
     &quot;Ace&quot; Brewer</A>, the genius creator of the Roku-only 
    streaming channel B-Movie TV, 53-years-old today. Being trapped in my 
    apartment for the past four weeks, Ace and his channel has kept me 
    from going stark raving mad, thanks to the choice of films he plays 
    all hours of the day and night. As readers of this site know, B-Movie 
    TV has replaced most of my TV watching, keeping me focused on films 
    from the '70s, '80s &amp; '90s. I know I'm always singing B-Movie 
    TV's praises, but it's not something that I do lightly. There is 
    NOTHING like this channel streaming today; it's a trip back to 
    kinder, more wilder, times that brings a rush of nostalgia to a 
    senile old brain such as mine, reminding me of things that happened 
    in my life that I thought I have totally forgotten. And for that I 
    say this to Ace: I consider you a brother I wish I had when growing 
    up. I really can't say more than that. Enjoy your day, Ace, and I 
    hope you enjoy a thousand more birthdays to come. You are my hero.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     18, 2020: The last thing I want to do is sound like an alarmist, but 
    for three weeks I, and everyone in my apartment building, have been 
    under forced quarantine. We are not allowed to leave our apartments. 
    While I understand why this is being done (a resident in my building 
    has COVID-19), the fact of the matter is we are not allowed to go 
    grocery shopping, depending on grocery stores to deliver. We only 
    have one grocery store in our town that delivers, ShopRite, but since 
    everyone is self isolating, delivery times have been backed up for 
    over two weeks and we can't get an open stot for a delivery. Even if 
    we can, nearly 3/4 of our order will be out of stock, so we must go 
    to the store and pick out alternatives, but we are not allowed to, as 
    we have police cars parked outside the front and back of our 
    apartment building, stopping people from going in and stopping people 
    from leaving. Here's my conundrum: I don't want to act like those 
    idiotic protesters in Michigan, who are causing traffic jams and 
    putting other people's lives at risk, but if we are put under forced 
    quarantine, the least they can do is feed us, not let us starve. And 
    we are going hungry (it's not a money thing, as we have plenty of 
    that). Personally, I can only eat one meal a day, so I can ration the 
    food I do have and I am tired of having pizza and sub sandwiches 
    delivered from the only restaurant in town that will deliver (all the 
    other ones are closed). All we are asking is to be treated like human 
    beings, but we are being ignored by everyone (including news 
    outlets), like we are disposable. Never in a million years did I ever 
    consider that we would be treated this way (and we are not getting 
    out of quarantine until May 15th), but if one family in this building 
    suffers, there will be hell to pay and I would be more than happy to 
    dish it out. If things don't change and soon, things are going to 
    turn ugly. We are The Forgotten during this strange time in our 
    planet's history. This should never happen. We are not asking for a 
    handout, we are asking to be treated like ordinary people.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    (all of which is generic and dull) like seriously what a fucking 
    rip-off! I can't remember the last time ANY film pulled a bullshit 
    stunt like that, like when the film was announced I was willing to 
    give it a shot because I don't think any subject should be off limits 
    for a film, but once I found out what a rip-off and lie this movie 
    was...... So I'd recommend letting people know about this rip-off of 
    a film on the front page as a PSA so people don't get fooled into 
    wasting money on this, much as I love Full Moon this feels 
    depressingly cynical and calculated on their part and I hope they

     24, 2020: Here is a message to all people: Quit hoarding food and 
    think of those less fortunate than you. I went to two grocery stores 
    today and I could find nothing of substance to eat on any of the 
    shelves in both stores. They were sold out of nearly 90% of stock and 
    didn't know when they would be able to restock. All I was able to 
    pick up was some soda and milk. I couldn't even find any breakfast 
    cereal or eggs. Hey, I'm not one of those &quot;less fortunate&quot; 
    people, so I will find some way to buy food, but we have to think 
    about those who lost their jobs and have very little money to spend 
    on things they need, such as food to stay alive. Not being able to 
    pick up what they need at the local grocery store is going to stretch 
    their very thin budget to the breaking point. As a society, we have 
    to stop being selfish and stop hoarding. We all will survive if we 
    just think about everyone, not just ourselves. Shop like you normally 
    do and quit shopping like the Apocalypse is coming. If we all do 
    this, we all survive. STOP BEING SELFISH!</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     28, 2020: Let's face it, it's only a matter of time before the 
    coronavirus begins infecting people in the United States. Over 65 
    people have already been diagnosed with it here and more cases are 
    being reported daily. But, if we are to listen to our psychotic 
    President, it's not such a big deal, as, according to him, only 15 
    people in the U.S. have been infected with it and nearly all of them 
    are getting better. He seems more interested in the Stock Market 
    falling due to the coronavirus outbreak than he is in human lives (He 
    even blames the Democratic Primaries for the spreading of the 
    virus!). We have to stop listening to his lies, because he thinks if 
    he keeps repeating those lies long enough, people will believe him. 
    And some people loyal to him are! He has put a muzzle on the CDC and 
    other health organizations, including his own health czar, so they 
    cannot tell us the truth. It will be at least twelve to eighteen 
    months until we have some type of vaccine to combat this (according 
    to President Liar, it will be ready in a month!), so be careful out 
    there, but don't be like our President. Don't believe a word he says 
    because he is incapable of telling the truth. The United States has 
    sunk to a country of despair thanks to this President (who thinks he 
    can do anything he wants since his cronies made sure he was aquitted 
    for impeachment). He doesn't care about human lives. He only cares 
    about money, as the Stock Market falling means less money for him and 
    his businesses. President Liar is incapable of running a country 
    during a crisis, or even without a crisis. Remember this come voting 
    time, that is, if we survive until then! I'm not kidding about this, 
    folks! </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">UPDATE:</FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> 
    Over 180 people have been infected in the U.S. with nine reported 
    deaths so far (as of March 4, 2020) and it is increasing 
    exponentially every passing day. While President Liar sits on his 
    orange hands, residents across the country are panicking, surgical 
    masks and hand sanitizer is sold out at every store and people are 
    making hard decisions, such as the newest James Bond film being moved 
    back from this coming April to November (well, that is not a hard 
    decision, but a financial one), sports outings (and whole seasons) 
    are being canceled, schools closed, nightly live late-night programs 
    being taped without an audience and yearly film festivals are being 
    postponed or outright canceled, all because of the COVID-19 
    Coronavirus. President Liar has put the least qualified person, Vice 
    President Dunce, in charge of this disaster (and it IS a disaster!), 
    as his record on health care is abominable (just look at his record 
    on AIDS as Governor of Indiana), and the President keeps going on TV 
    and lying to us all, giving us wrong numbers, wrong &quot;facts&quot; 
    and wrong decisions (such as restricting travel from Europe to the 
    U.S. without telling the leaders of European countries in advance).

     24, 2020: A jury has found sleazebag Harvey Weinstein guilty of of 
    sexual assault and third-degree rape, which could get him 29 years 
    behind bars, yet the jury also decided not to believe Annabella 
    Sciorra's testimony that Weinstein had raped and assaulted her at her 
    Gramercy Park apartment in the early 1990s. I believe this is nothing 
    but the jury trying their best to seem &quot;fair and balanced&quot;, 
    even though they knew Weinstein actually did rape Sciorra and would 
    put the scumbag behind bars for life. Juries have to realize that 
    there is no such thing as partitioning their &quot;fairness&quot;. 
    Weinstein was (and is) a pig, who used his fame and wealth to rape 
    and assault women, including Sciorra. At least the judge in this case 
    is making Weinstein stay in prison until his sentencing hearing in 
    March of this year. Let's hope he serves the maximum&nbsp; and gets 
    the same treatment in prison that he handed women when he was free. I 
    just hope his money doesn't earn him a minimum sentence. My heart 
    goes out to Annabella Sciorra, who was brave enough to tell the 
    truth, yet made to look like a liar by the jury's split verdict. I 
    only hope this doesn't stop women from testifying in their own rape 
    cases. I also hope that Weinstein's vicious lawyers never get paid. 
    Their treatment of Sciorra and other women who testified can politely 
    be called inhumane. </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">UPDATE:</FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> 
    Harvey Weinstein complained of chest pains while being driven to

    hospital. Oh, no, Harvey. You don't get off that easy. Your pain will 
    be much greater in prison, but the pain will not be in your chest 
    (think lower). </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">UPDATE #2:</FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> 
    March 11, 2020: Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison, 
    even though his scumbag lawyers were asking for five years, citing 
    Weinstein was involved in many charitable organizations while 
    awaiting his trial. Thankfully, the judge presiding over this case 
    didn't buy this load of horseshit and sentenced the rapey Weinstein 
    to nearly the maximum sentence. Even Weinstein's closing statements 
    to the judge and his victims (many who were in the courtroom to hear 
    the sentence) was a weak mea culpa. Weinstein will probably die in 
    prison, but are we to feel sorry for him? Hell no! My faith has been 
    restored in the U.S. justice system, even though Weinstein's scumbag 
    lawyers plan to appeal the sentence.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     20, 2020: Well, folks, IMDb has done it again, only this time they 
    didn't just shoot themselves in the foot, they also put the pistol to

    IMDb have &quot;improved&quot; their homepage so that it looks like a 
    bastardized version of Netflix, or better yet, it looks like some 
    teen tech puked it up after drinking too much Mountain Dew. IMDb 
    seems to be going all digital (They are &quot;rolling out&quot; the 
    new look, so if you haven't seen it yet, you soon will), which is 
    strange for a site that thrives on printed information and what use 
    to take one click of the mouse (such as reading the latest, movie, TV 
    and celebrity news), now takes three clicks. Will someone please tell 
    me how this is an improvement? I have just one thing to say to IMDb: 
    Wise up, idiots! They put a newbie IMDb employee on the boards to 
    deliver this news (it was her first post!), so, of course, she will 
    be the sacrificial lamb, but people who are a whole lot smarter than 
    me can see where this is headed. IMDb wants to pull in the youth 
    market, you know the ones, young adults who watch movies on their 
    phones (and will have severe eye problems when they get older), and 
    throw out all the veteran users of the site. Don't let this happen. 
    Voice your displeasure and let IMDb know that change doesn't have to 
    mean a complete overhaul of their home page. There's change and then 
    there's CHANGE. How long before the entire site follows suit? </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">UPDATE:</FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> 
    Rather than complaining to IMDb (who don't seem to give a fuck), I

    membership (IMDb's new homepage is an exact copy of Amazon Prime's 
    Video homepage) if they don't revert the homepage back to its 
    previous incarnation. Customer Service will say that they can't help 
    you in this matter, but if enough people complain, they will have no 
    choice but to listen and respond. IMDb now thinks of us as 
    &quot;customers&quot; rather than &quot;readers&quot; or 
    &quot;users&quot; and that is purely Amazon's doing. Don't let them

     12, 2020: This new year is starting off on the wrong foot and if we 
    don't stop thinking like idiots, this could be the end of our planet. 
    I am, of course, talking about people backing their party line, no 
    matter how wrong it is. With the recent shooting down of a Ukraine 
    airliner by Iran using Russia missles, how can this not be traced 
    back to &quot;President&quot; Donald Trump's actions regarding Iraq 
    and Iran? Yet, Trump cronies keep insisting that their 
    &quot;savior&quot; Trump is doing what any President would do. 
    Really? Would any President do such a thing to get the peoples' mind 
    off his impeachment by having people &quot;accidentally&quot; killed? 
    Wise up people and face the facts. Trump is nothing but a disgusting 
    businessman who wants you to watch his right hand while his left one 
    destroys the United States in ways we have never seen before. We are 
    becoming a joke to the world and people hate us in ways we have never 
    seen before. Think before you act or speak. Only common sense will 
    defeat such an evil. It's Trump's worst enemy. I hate talking 
    politics on this site, but it's time to for me to speak my piece 
    before my country and the world is destroyed by evil, twisted minds. 
    And, yes, I am talking about the people who back Trump, no matter 
    what he does or says. They are more dangerous than Trump himself, 
    because they give Trump a feeling of invincibility. That is where his 
    power lies. Lies ARE NOT the new truth! </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">UPDATE:</FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> 
    After the Senate hearings into Trump's impeachment, all I have to say

    lines, letting a criminal get away with his crimes. Have you no 
    shame? I hope people remember this treachery come election time, not 
    only for the Presidency, but for every House and Senate Republicans' 
    careers. They have no place in this country, other than to destroy 
    it. President Trump and Fox News have brainwashed a new generation of 
    people who will believe everything that they say. It is a real

    instilling common sense back to their brains by whatever means possible.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    September!). Not only has it cost an unacceptable amount of human 
    life (23 so far), it also caused the deaths of countless amounts of

    feel that they had to fix something that wasn't broken? Not only is 
    their new look hard on the eyes for people with vision problems (It's 
    a proven fact that white type on a black background, which is what 
    IMDb's new searchbar is, not only is detrimental to people with eye 
    problems, it could make their eyesight worse!), they've also omitted 
    some long-standing features, such as their poster gallery, which was 
    one of my favorite features! I tried contacting techs at <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">IMDb</A> 
    about this omission and they have given me a Google 'shortcut&quot;

    are eventually going to delete, like they did when they deleted the

    politicians on the NRA's payroll would just realize that human lives 
    are more important than gun rights. Contact your State's politicians

    give them a vote come election time if they don't do something about 
    gun violence, especially in our schools, where children should feel 
    safe, not scared out of their wits. Make them understand the harm 
    they are doing to our children by not growing a backbone and standing 
    up for our children's safety. The answer is not posting cadres of 
    police to stand guard at our schools. The answer is keeping guns out 
    of the hands of people who don't care about anyone's safety. Make 
    them understand this as clearly and succinctly as possible. They will 
    no longer be in office unless they take a stand about gun violence. 
    Let our children grow up not afraid of our school system. In other 
    words, let our children have normal childhoods! My thoughts and 
    prayers go out to Tiffany and her family, as well as the parents who 
    lost their children to sensless gun violence. I hope to live to see 
    the day when this senseless violence is abolished for good.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     14, 2019: I'm calling bullshit on Roku for not having customer 
    service of any type. Recently my Roku Express + was automatically 
    updated with new version 9.2.0 and ever since it was automatically 
    installed, it kicks me out of whatever I watch after 30 minutes and 
    takes me to the home screen. Since I use my Roku to basically watch 
    B-Movie TV and films on YouTube and Amazon Prime, it's frustrating 
    and annoying getting kicked out of what I am watching and I have to 
    log back on. After doing some research, I found that this is a 
    problem with the new update with Express + players only. Since I use 
    my player with a tube TV next to my computer (I have a Roku Ultra for 
    my 60&quot; plasma in my living room), I use it a lot and to have 
    this problem is unacceptable. The lack of customer service is 
    especially depressing. I even went to the Roku group on Facebook and 
    they are about as much help as tits on a rock. Since B-Movie TV is a 
    Roku-only channel, I want this problem fixed as soon as possible, but 
    Roku keeps ignoring my DMs or tells me to go to their web site, which 
    is basically worthless. Roku, wise up, or you are about to lose a 
    customer! If anyone has a workaround for this problem, please email 
    me. I'm at my wit's end! UPDATE: I joined the Facebook Roku Codes,

    were deleted! WTF is going on here? UPDATE #2: Like most remotes, the

     11, 2019: Here's some good news. Make that great news. According to <A HREF="http://theplaylist.net">The
     Playlist</A>: Without hesitation, horror fans will likely include 
    filmmaker Dario Argento among the very best directors to have ever 
    graced the genre. And not only is he one of the most iconic 
    filmmakers in horror history, his films, such as <A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A>,
     <A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP RED</A> and <A HREF="thriller.htm#Tenebre1982">TENEBRE</A> 
    revolutionized the giallo subgenre and introduced it to audiences all 
    around the world. However, in recent years, Argento has been 
    relatively quiet. Well, according to a new report, the filmmaker is 
    stepping behind the camera once again for a new TV series titled 
    LONGINUS. <A HREF="http://www.variety.com">Variety</A> is reporting 
    that Dario Argento will step behind the camera for a new 
    horror-thriller series, LONGINUS. The series is said to delve into 
    the &#147;obscure and terrifying&#148; imagination of Argento. The 
    production companies, BIM and Publispei, explained LONGINUS will be 
    an &#147;auteur series for the international market&#148; and will be 
    set &#147;between the French Alps of Grenoble and the Siena of the 
    Palio&#148; will fall between &#147;the real and the 
    supernatural.&#148; So, yeah, we still don&#146;t know much about it. 
    If you&#146;re familiar with your Biblical stories, Longinus also is 
    the name of the Roman centurion that stabbed Jesus Christ in the ribs 
    with a spear during the crucifixion. Though, it&#146;s unclear if the 
    series is set to tackle anything Biblical. LONGINUS marks the first 
    project for the filmmaker since 2012&#146;s <A HREF="dracula_3d_2012.htm">DRACULA
     3D</A>. Throughout the years, Argento has also dabbled in TV 
    projects, with his most recent small-screen effort being a couple of 
    episodes of the anthology series, <A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">MASTERS
     OF HORROR</A>. Recently, while at Fantastic Fest, the filmmaker 
    hinted that he had another film on the docket, as well, but there has 
    yet to be a formal announcement. Obviously, LONGINUS is still in the 
    early stages of development, with no network or streaming platform 
    announced as a partner. However, you have to imagine that the first 
    project from Dario Argento in almost a decade will attract plenty of buyers.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     18, 2019: It seems everyone wants a piece of the streaming pie and 
    it's the customer that loses. More and more streaming services are 
    being developed, each one costing the customer more and more money, 
    pricing streaming out of nearly everyone's pockets. Companies such as 
    Disney (Disney +), NBC (Peacock), Universal (HBO Max) and Apple 
    (Apple TV +) and streaming channel Quibi are forming their own 
    streaming services, each one of them costing about $12.00 a month on 
    average. The biggest problem I have with this is that most of their 
    programming should have ended up on Network TV, but companies got 
    greedy and decided to compartmentalize TV, charging the viewer to 
    watch something that they should have gotten for free. Throwing a few 
    &quot;fucks&quot; into the dialogue is no reason we should have to 
    pay for something that we should have gotten as part of our monthly 
    TV bill. The only thing we can do is not subscribe to these channels 
    and tell the money-grubbing executives that we are not going to have 
    any of this. Streaming is now no better than having a $200+ monthly 
    cable bill. As a matter of fact, it will now cost more to get 
    everything you now have on cable to what you will receive streaming.

    true by the firing of Shane Gillis as a new member of <A HREF="saturday_night_live_tv_series_1975.htm">Saturday

    on their hands dug up some past statements Gillis said and posted 
    them online, just to get him fired. And like all the times before, he 
    was fired. I only have one problem with this and it's a big one: What 
    ever happened to freedom of speech? While Gillis' remarks were said 
    in jest (he is a comedian, after all), they take on a whole new 
    meaning when taken out of context and this whole new meaning is why 
    he was fired. Stop this insanity! We all said something off color in 
    our past (I know I have). Would you want those words revealed today?

     15, 2019: The passing of another September day brings more bad news: 
    The death of musician Ric Ocasek, the rail-thin singer and guitarist 
    for the '70s &amp; '80s band The Cars. He not only mixed pop with 
    electronic music (he wrote nearly every song The Cars recorded), 
    creating a new brand of New Wave music, he later became a successful 
    music producer of such bands such as Weezer, Bad Brains and The 
    Killers. Thinking back, The Cars were a band that meant a lot to me 
    in the beginning days of New Wave and their sheer amount of hit tunes 
    (such as &quot;Good Times Roll&quot;, &quot;You Might Think&quot;, 
    &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; and, especially, &quot;Drive&quot;) 
    during the decade they were a band will be hard to beat and also 
    shaped my life during a really hard time. Damn, I hate when my music 
    heroes begin passing away. It makes me think of my mortality. Ric 
    Okasec was found dead in his New York apartment, the victim of heart 
    disease and he was 75-years-old. My condolences to his family and fans.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     better than I remember seeing it in theaters back in the day. This 
    is the perfect American giallo film, lensed in my backyard of 
    Paterson, NJ. I remember watching them film it on the streets and I 
    even had a short conversation with director/co-screenwriter Alfred 
    Sole, who was as gracious as he could be. It then disappoints me that 
    in the many extras (an Arrow trademark) supplied on the disc that 
    Sole mentions that he never watched a giallo film before he made this 
    film, because I remember him telling me that he was a fan of Dario 
    Argento. I know this was over 40 years ago and memories may be foggy, 
    but my journal (I kept a daily journal of my activities and still do) 
    tells me otherwise. But that makes no mind, because this 
    &quot;proto-slasher&quot; is as close as you can get to a giallo 
    film. The Arrow disc also contains a booklet and a poster, only 
    available for the first pressing. For those who order the disc too 
    late (and it is selling fast!), I have scanned the booklet <A HREF="alice_sweet_alice_1976_arrow_blu-ray.htm#Booklet">HERE</A> 
    for your reading and visual pleasure. No one does Blu-Rays as well as 
    Arrow and I thank them for giving us this film. It is a remarkable, 
    if overlooked, foray into mystery and terror, told with a scathing 
    religious subtext, something you won't easily forget once you see it 
    (Look for a review very soon on this site). Personally, I have seen 
    this film at least a dozen times and on every viewing I pick up 
    something new to discover, making this film 100% re-watchable. So hop 
    onto Amazon or whatever site you use for DVDs and Blu-Rays and 
    purchase this film ASAP! You won't regret it. Hey, have I ever 
    steered you wrong? Now, if I only could find the unedited version of 
    Sole's freshman film, the porno flick <A HREF="deep_sleep_1972.htm">DEEP
     SLEEP</A> (1972), a comedy/horror tale about necrophilia! It only 
    seems to exist in a heavily edited form, the original unedited

    certain movies were not allowed to be shown on TV, all done for 
    &quot;the people.&quot; Bullshit! This was done to cleanse the minds 
    of politicians, who have no idea on how to deal with violence in 
    society, especially gun violence, rather blaming music, TV, video 
    games and films for it. When will we learn, as a society, that this

     05, 2019: I have been staying away from politics for the past year 
    or so, but I have to remark on Trump's &quot;celebration&quot;, which 
    he called &quot;A Salute To America&quot;,&nbsp; last night. It was 
    straight out of Russia and North Korea, with Trump speaking at the 
    Lincoln Memorial surrounded by tanks, telling us how our 18th Century 
    forefathers protected airports (!) from the enemy (Blaming it on a 
    teleprompter error. Really?) Not only is Trump out of his fucking 
    mind, it only proves that his brain is slowly going blank, like he 
    has Alzheimers and that he admires Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-Un 
    more than anyone in the United States, but not the &quot;camps&quot; 
    he set up to house &quot;illegal&quot; border crossers, splitting up 
    families and causing death in some cases, which he is quite proud of. 
    These are not the acts of a President of the United States, these are 
    the acts of a dictator who thinks he can do anything he pleases, 
    including eliminating our God given rights as Americans. When major 
    TV networks (besides Fox, that is) ignored Trump's celebration, it 
    should give you an idea that something is majorly wrong and it is not 
    because they are prejudiced against the President. It's because this 
    &quot;celebration&quot; was nothing but back-patting propaganda, the 
    stuff we saw during the Cold War coming out of Communist countries. 
    And that is where the United States is heading! I wonder what Trump 
    would think of Putin if he knew Russia was laughing at him, one 
    Russian news commentator saying that the &quot;newest tanks&quot; 
    that Trump promised to show were &#147;Abrams and Sherman tanks, used 
    during World War II and withdrawn from service in 1957.&#148; Caught

    science fiction films (including the colorful mid-'60s space operas 
    by Antonio Margheriti and the turgid late-'70s <A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR
     WARS</A> rip-offs by Alfonso Brescia), such as the early-'80s 
    post-apocalypse genre (my favorite of all Italian genres), giant 
    monsters on the loose, <A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A> (1979) 
    rip-offs and even a chapter on the films of gonzo director Elio Petri (<A HREF="10th_victim_1965.htm">THE
     10TH VICTIM</A> - 1965). It deals mainly with films from 1958 to 
    2000, but there is a chapter on much more recent Italian genre 
    efforts, many of which I never heard of before and which I intend to 
    search out. The price for this book is more than reasonable, 
    especially if you are a fan of Italian genre flicks and it can be 
    purchased from Amazon. If more books were as reasonably priced like 
    this one, I would buy more. I love the feel of a book in my fingers,

    Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Shannon, turn in amazing performances, 
    but what I found peculiar is that Doug Jones, who portrayed the 
    amphibian creature, never even got mentioned in any of the major 
    awards. His performance is key to believing such a creature exists 
    and he does it amazingly. The movie would not have worked without his 
    riveting performance, which is why I find it weird he was overlooked 
    for major awards. I applaud Guillermo del Toro for his expert 
    direction of his own original story and I especially applaud Sally 
    Hawkins for turning in such a brave performance, exposing her soul 
    (and so much more) for all to see. If you haven't seen this film, see 
    it now! </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Life is but the shipwreck of

    I do know that if someone posts a suicidal Instagram post on the

    than a minute to show everyone that he is OK, because that is not the 
    way it works. SNL dropped the ball here. Rather than showing his face 
    on TV, they should have made sure he got the medical attention that 
    he needs. As someone who has lost more than two people to suicide, I 
    can tell you that Davidson's Instagram post was a cry for help. If he 
    doesn't get proper attention soon, it won't be long until he goes 
    through with his promise. And then everyone loses. Yes, suicide is 
    painful, not only for the person who commits it, but for all the 
    people who knew and loved them. Take it from me SNL, putting him on 
    TV is not the answer. Get him the help he needs and do it quick or

    and only come before a film or when you first access the channel. 
    They also have some hilarious filler between films, including a 
    shocking ROBOCOP take-off (professionally realized, funny and 
    cringe-inducing to all men), bizarre animation (&quot;Amazing

    items at ridiculous prices. First of all, Wish seems to be run by the 
    Chinese, as nearly all of the items listed on the site ship from 
    China. Secondly, they are cheap knock-offs, not the real thing. 
    Thirdly, be careful of bait and switch, as the price of the item 
    changes if you don't look carefully. I ordered ten items, the price 
    range between $5 to $10 for each item, in early June. After waiting 
    over a month, only five of these items arrived and none of them were 
    as advertised. When the other five items didn't arrive, I contacted 
    Wish Customer Support and they did reimburse me (after telling me to 
    wait another 30 days, which I refused to do!): only 50% of what I 
    actually paid for each item! Yes, this site feels like a scam to me, 
    since even non-delivered items make money for Wish. I hate to be lied 
    to, especially when I read the rave reviews that &quot;customers&quot;
     have submitted. They all read as if English was their second (or

     1, 2018: There have been many theories on how Natalie Wood died in

     22, 2017: While I support the drive to make sure sexual abusers are 
    brought to justice and lose their livelihood, am I the only one that 
    feels like we are losing our long-fought-for right to Freedom Of 
    Speech? First off: John Schnattner, patriarch and TV spokesperson for 
    PAPA JOHN'S PIZZA chain, is forced to step down as the CEO of the 
    company he founded for saying what many of us felt. He blamed the low 
    ratings Professional Football and the downturn in business his 
    franchise experienced (it was the official pizza of the NFL) to the 
    disrespect players such as Colin Koepernick and others showed our 
    flag and national anthem. He was roasted in his own ovens for saying 
    what many of us were thinking (yet Schnattner remains as the official 
    TV spokesperson). These players deserve none of our respect and I did 
    watch less football this year because of it. Since when is telling 
    what you feel a fireable offense? It boggles the mind! And now, an 
    online petition has collected over 19,000 signatures to get Matt 
    Damon's cameo taken out of the film OCEAN'S 8 because he said what he 
    felt about women coming out of the woodwork to point fingers at 
    sexual abusers. He was not saying that Harvey Weinstein was innocent 
    of the charges leveled against him, just that it was common knowledge 
    in the industry for years. Blame the industry, not Matt Damon for 
    saying it. This country is turning into thin-skinned sissies who 
    refuse to hear an opposing view without trying to ruin a person's 
    credibility. I blame Number 45 and the way he lies constantly and 
    disguises it as truth. He is the chief abuser of Freedom Of Speech. 
    Just look at his Twitter remarks. He should be held liable for some 
    of his remarks, but stupid people eat it up. No President should act 
    this way and it is spreading across this country, infecting us like a

    Burton was engaged to Manson in 2014 and she ran several websites

    carved an &quot;X&quot; between his eyes during his trials in 1971

    and much like his followers who commited those heinous crimes, he 
    became a real cult item (Serial killers have <A HREF="charles_manson_appreciation_society.htm">groupies</A>).

     5, 2017: It seems we found a bigger pig than Bill Cosby! The 
    Weinstein Company faces potential legal jeopardy in the wake of a New 
    York Times expose detailing sexual harassment claims against 
    co-chairman Harvey Weinstein. Though the cases referenced in the 
    story have been settled, it is now possible that new accusers could 
    come forward. &#147;His company is extremely vulnerable,&#148; says 
    Debbie Katz, a Washington, D.C., attorney who represents plaintiffs 
    in harassment suits. &#147;The board has been on notice that there is 
    significant misconduct, settlement moneys have been paid, and there 
    has been no corrective action.&#148;The Times story alleged a pattern 
    of behavior, in which Weinstein would meet with actresses or young 
    female employees at hotel rooms. According to the story, he would 
    either expose himself or encourage the women to give him nude 
    massages. A former employee, Lauren O&#146;Connor, made a detailed 
    complaint about Weinstein&#146;s behavior, which reached the board 
    level. In Thursday Otober 5, 2017's damning New York Times 
    expos&eacute; &#151; an in-depth investigation by Jodi Kantor and 
    Megan Twohey titled &quot;Decades of Sexual Harassment Accusations 
    Against Harvey Weinstein&quot; &#151; the movie mogul admitted he has 
    issues and, thus, would be taking a leave of absence to deal with 
    them while consulting with therapists and lawyers.&nbsp; However, 
    because this is Harvey Weinstein, the outspoken executive who plays 
    by his own rules, he's not about to retreat from the spotlight 
    quietly. In fact, he's chasing his own story. Fox News reporter 
    Lauren Sivan claims that producer Harvey Weinstein once masturbated

    Company. &quot;In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey 
    Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The 
    Weinstein Company &#151; brother Robert Weinstein, Lance Maerov, 
    Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar &#151; have determined, and 
    have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The

     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A> is doing an episode about him, or rather a man

    events followed an Oct. 5 New York Times article by investigative 
    reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey detailing sexual harassment 
    claims spanning decades on the part of the mogul, including from 
    actress Ashley Judd. The paper also reported, citing two unnamed 
    sources, that &quot;Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements 
    with women.&quot; While Weinstein's wife, Georgina Chapman, has filed 
    for divorce and many other female actors, including Gwyneth Paltrow 
    and Angelina Jolie have came forward with tales of unwanted touching 
    and advances, The Weinstein Company is bleeding money. Channels are 
    canceling TV shows. Theatrical arms are putting films on permanent 
    hold and anything with the name Weinstein on it is suffering. And he 
    was Banned for Life From The TV Academy. Could this be the end of The 
    Weinstein Company? It sure looks so. And to think just a few years 
    ago they were a part of The Walt Disney Company (who are having 
    troubles of their own when they banned critics from an L.A. paper 
    from advance screenings of the new STAR WARS film after the critics 
    posted a story that Disney was sought out to be purchased by cable 
    giant ComCast. Solidarity has spread to other papers and magazines, 
    who also refuse to release reviews for the film and others in the 
    future.) Meanwhile, the Twitter account belonging to Rose McGowan 
    (who was one of the originators accusing Harvey Weinstein of sexual 
    harassment and rape) was placed on temporary suspension Wednesday 
    night for unspecified violations of the social media site&#146;s 
    rules. I have one question: If her account can be suspended, why 
    can't Trump's (another serial groper)? Amazon on Friday, October 13, 
    2017 became the latest outfit to distance itself from the 
    still-unfolding Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal, severing 
    ties with The Weinstein Company, and canceling an in-development 
    series from David O. Russell that was set to star Robert De Niro and 
    Julianne Moore. All three support Amazon's decision. October 14, 
    2017: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has expelled 
    disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein from its ranks. The Academy&#146;s 
    54-member board of governors &#151; which includes such Hollywood 
    luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Whoopi Goldberg and 
    Kathleen Kennedy &#151; held an emergency meeting at the 
    organization&#146;s Beverly Hills headquarters today and voted to 
    strip away Weinstein&#146;s lifetime membership. So many actresses, 
    including Eva Green, Lysette Anthony and Natalie Mendoza have accused 
    him of sexual abuse or rape, it's a wonder Harvey Weinstein got any 
    movies made. His membership to the Producers Guild of America has 
    also been terminated on October 16, 2017. On October 17, 2017, Harvey 
    Weinstein formally resigned from the board of The Weinstein Company.

    he was once molested by Kevin Spacey (in&nbsp; 2008, when he was 18 
    years old) while his own father was in the room. &#147;It happened

    Netflix is killing off Spacey's character, leveler heads prevailed at 
    Netflix an said they were officially severing ties with HOUSE OF

    Steroid use and dog fighting, why can't they forgive Actors? Now will 
    someone please shut Rose McGowan up? October 30, 2017: Rose McGowan 
    is the subject of an arrest warrant related to a felony drug charge 
    in Loudoun County, Virginia, the Associated Press is reporting. 
    Police issued the warrant on Feb. 1, following a Jan. 20 incident in 
    which traces of narcotics were detected on items left on a United 
    flight bound for Washington Dulles International Airport. Police say 
    McGowan did not respond to attempts to contact her to appear in 
    court, according to the AP. The actress was blunt in her assessment 
    of the charges, calling them &#147;a load of HORSESHIT&#148; late 
    Monday morning and accuses the authorities of trying to 
    &quot;silence&quot; her. McGowan became a prominent voice against 
    sexual harassment after going public with her accusation that she was 
    raped by Harvey Weinstein, and confirming in a New York Times report 
    that she was one of the women with whom Weinstein settled sexual 
    harassment lawsuits. She later said that just weeks before the New 
    York Times report was published, Weinstein offered her $1 million to 
    stay quiet about her accusations. Some say that McGowan is becoming a 
    little too prominet and should learn to keep quiet unless she has the 
    evidence to back it up. October 31, 2017: Now Jeremy Piven is being

     Henstridge claims that Ratner forced her to perform oral sex on him 
    in his New York apartment in the 1990s. The actress, then a 
    19-year-old model, was hanging out with the then-music video director 
    watching TV. Henstridge fell asleep, she told the Los Angeles Times, 
    and when she woke up the others had left and she was alone with 
    Ratner. He blocked the exit and began touching himself, she tells the 
    Times, and then he forced her to perform oral sex on him. He has been 
    annointed the &quot;King Of Pigs&quot; on Twitter. All projects with 
    Ratner&#146;s production company, Ratpac Entertainment are on hold, 
    including Ratner's biography on Hugh Hefner, that Ratner was attached 
    to direct and produce. Ratner's attorney Martin Singer dismissed the 
    accounts of Henstridge and the five other women, who opened up to the 
    Times in a series of interviews, saying the alleged sexual misconduct 
    occurred in private homes, on movie sets or at industry events. None 
    of the women the Times spoke to reported the allegations to the 
    police, the paper says in its Nov. 1 story and Ratner vehemently

    She soon discovers the camera has the power to murder those who come 
    in contact with it. The cast includes Kathryn Prescott, Mitch 
    Pileggi, Grace Zabriskie, Tyler Young, Keenan Tracey, Samantha Logan, 
    Priscilla Quintana, Madelaine Petsch, and Javier Botet. Producers are 
    Roy Lee and Chris Bender. At the 2016 American Film Market, Klevberg 
    and Lee made a presentation to buyers and touted the fright factor 
    for POLAROID.&#148; Lee, who helped develop <A HREF="ring_2002.htm">THE
     RING</A> and <A HREF="grudge_2_2006.htm">THE GRUDGE</A> franchises, 
    asserted that POLAROID would be a franchise starter. Weinstein&#146;s 
    brother Bob Weinstein, founder and head of Dimension, said at the 
    same event that Dimension would focus on fewer films with bigger 
    budgets in order to create franchises. And so it begins......no more 
    miniscule budgets for films like <A HREF="short reviews.htm#HellraiserRevalat10">HELLRAISER:
     REVELATIONS</A> (2010) or <A HREF="horror a - c.htm#ChildrenCornGenesis">CHILDREN

    being snatched-up by other companies. Dimension and Miramax were the 
    Kings of Franchises. Time for them to relinquish their mantle to 
    BlumHouse Productions or WWE Productions (That's taking into fact 
    that Jason Blum &amp; Vince McMahon are not accused of anything 
    sexual). Actress Julianna Margulies said in an interview that 
    producer Harvey Weinstein and actor Steven Seagal both tried to 
    sexually harass her earlier in her career. Doe this really surprise

    the filming of <A HREF="out_for_justice_1991.htm">OUT FOR JUSTICE</A> 
    (1991), Marguiles' first acting assignment. This is no way for any 
    woman to enter show business. Anna Graham has has accused Dustin 
    Hoffman in The Hollywood Reporter of sexually harassing her as a 
    teenager in a column that describes the actor as making lewd comments 
    and groping her on the set of the 1985 TV film adaptation of DEATH OF 
    A SALESMAN. Dustin Hoffman? There soon may be no males in Hollywood 
    if it keeps up at this rate. It seems that women are getting exactly 
    what they want: Dominence in Hollywood! Both LAPD &amp; NYC Police 
    believe they have a legal case against Weinstein, so look for<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/matt lauer photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"> 
    an arrest shortly (remember to bring two sets of hand cuffs, the man 
    is portly!). When Corey Feldman gets involved in the sexual abuse 
    name game, it is time to take a real close look at the allegations. 
    Corey says he has the names and even named one, a bit actor who 
    worked with him on <A HREF="lost_boys_1987.htm">THE LOST BOYS</A></FONT></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> <B>(1987)

     [The LAPD have dropped Feldman's case, but may reopen it, since they 
    finally found the audio tapes that Feldman made in 1993, where he 
    names his rapists. This tape was made when the LAPD was investigating 
    Michael Jackson on pedophilia charges]. One important thing for 
    victims of such horrendous allegations to remember: Charges Delayed = 
    Delayed Justice. The time for female empowerment is now! Add about a 
    dozen more well-known names, such as Charlie Rose (Who CBS &amp; PBS 
    terminated from CBS THIS MORNING, 60 MINUTES and THE CHARLIE ROSE 
    SHOW), Ryan Seacrest, Disney/Pixar's John Lasseter (Who took a six 
    month leave of absence for hugging women on his staff. Hugging? Give 
    me a break!) and, surprise!, actor Tom Sizemore (Who did more than 
    hug.) and it is beginning to look like it would be easier to point 
    out sexual predators in showbiz rather than pointing out the innocent 
    ones. Every day the list grows longer. Nearly all these people have 
    been suspended from their movies, TV shows, studios or outright 
    replaced (such as Kevin Spacey &amp; Jeffrey Tambor), that there is 
    going to be a male actor shortage when it comes to casting a TV 
    Series or Film. Remember men: Karma is a bitch. Women will no longer 
    be sexually abused and keep silent (but hugging is not sexual abuse 
    unless they grab her ass!). And that is a good thing. NOTE: November 
    29, 2017: Matt Lauer has been fired from THE TODAY SHOW and NBC NEWS 
    for &quot;inappropriate sexual behavior&quot;. That is a big loss for 
    NBC since Lauer has been with TODAY since 1993 and will surely put a 
    dent in their ratings. Of course, Trump Tweeted &#147;Check out Andy 
    Lack&#146;s past!&#148;, referring to the Chairman of NBC NEWS. Talk 
    about the pot calling the kettle black! This is your President, 
    folks! (He will never be mine because his behavior is beyond the 
    pale. Not presidential by any means.). Word is out that some tech 
    giants from Silicon Valley will be the next to get the ax. Stay 
    tuned. NOTE #2: December 5, 2017: Danny Masterson (<A HREF="that_70s_show_tv_series_1998-2006.htm">THAT
     '70S SHOW</A>) was written out of Netflix's streaming series THE 
    RANCH due to him being accused of raping multiple women. Masterson 
    says, </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;From day one, I have denied the 
    outrageous allegations against me. I have never been charged with a 
    crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed 
    innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it 
    seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I 
    understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> 
    What Masterson said is true. We, as a society, have to figure out a 
    way to separate the false allegations from the true ones and not jump 
    the gun and destroy a person's career and reputation (In Netflix's 
    defense, they did wait a long time before firing Masterson, saying 
    that they didn't believe the four women who accused him of rape, but 
    the women came out and accused Netflix of favoring Masterson. Netflix 
    fired Masterson merely not to get another black eye like they did 
    with Kevin Spacey and HOUSE OF CARDS). This has become a feeding 
    frenzy and people with a grudge against a certain person can allege 
    (or have someone else do it) inappropriate sexual abuse. Rather than 
    perform an investigation, studios fire the person assumed guilty and 
    then perform an investigation, not caring the the person fired may be 
    innocent. Masterson has been one of the few to deny the charges 
    against him. Netflix will resume shooting Season 3 of the series in 
    early 2018, but will keep Masterson in the episodes already shot. 
    NOTE #3: December 6; 2017: Time magazine named &#147;The Silence 
    Breakers&#148; of the #MeToo movement its 2017 Person Of The Year. It 
    looks like it's going to be a long ride until this finger-pointing 
    ends. At least Trump didn't get it (He came in second).</FONT></FONT></FONT></B><BR>

     20, 2017: My condolences to the family and children of Linkin Park 
    frontman Chester Bennington, who committed suicide by hanging at the 
    age of 41. They released their first all-Pop album in May of 2017 and 
    it hurt some fans' feelings because this was unlike anything they 
    have ever done before (Linkin Park had three albums go Diamond) 
    because it sounded nothing like their first album's cut &quot;In The 
    End&quot; from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. I hate to disagree with the 
    fans but their new album, &quot;One More Light&quot; is a delight and 
    the sixth song, &quot;Heavy&quot; is my favorite Linkin Park song of 
    all time. Listening to its lyrics will give you some idea of how 
    Bennington felt at the time (He sang Leonard Cohen's 
    &quot;Hallelujah&quot; at Chris Cornell's funeral and killed himself 
    on Cornell's birthday), but he left six children behind. We have to 
    start talking seriously about suicide because people are killing 
    themselves at a rate not seen since the Great Depression in the 
    1920's &amp; 1930's. It's time to bring suicide out into the open and 
    discuss it with all seriousness and not make fun of it like the 
    assholes on Facebook (Josh Hadley, I'm looking at you.). Suicide 
    doesn't mean only one person suffers. Everyone who knew the victims

     17, 2017: If people are wondering why I have not written obituaries 
    for Martin Landau and George Romero, the explanation is simple: Once 
    I do, it makes their death final in my eyes. I adored both of these 
    men because I did security for both men, both at conventions and at 
    film sites. You will never meet two nicer guys. I remember Martin 
    once mentioning to me that he wondered if people would remember him 
    after all the bad films he made and I told him all great actors like 
    himself always get a second chance at greatness and I proceded to 
    quickly name everything I remember he did and it was a long list. He 
    was shocked that I knew his career that well and less than five years 
    later, he won an Academy Award&reg; for Best Supporting Actor for his 
    uncanny portrayal of Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's <A HREF="ed_wood_1994.htm">ED
     WOOD</A> (1994). Martin sent me a letter and all it said was: 
    &quot;You were right, my friend.&quot; Martin and I remained friends 
    (I called him &quot;Uncle Marty&quot;) until the day he passed away 
    (He once invited me to join him as his guest on the first X-Files 
    movie, <A HREF="x_files_fight_the_future_1998.htm">THE X-FILES: FIGHT 
    THE FUTURE</A> [1998], but I couldn't because I was working. Now I 
    wished I did.). As for George Romero: I handled security for him at a 
    Pennsylvania convention, where thousands of people showed up for a 
    photo, autograph or both. He was very kind to each and every person 
    who stood before him and when it was over, I said to him, I never 
    seen someone treat his fans with such joyfulness. He said, &quot;Why 
    not? They were the ones who put me here. They deserve to remember me 
    as a kind person.&quot; And he was that kind of gentleman, even 
    though he made the best trio of gory horror films in the history of 
    film, <A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD</A> 
    (1968), which I remember, even at the age of 11, being the horror 
    film that would change horror films in the future forever; <A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_1978.htm">DAWN
     OF THE DEAD</A> (1978), one of the goriest films of the 70's which 
    was also a scathing treatise on consumerism; and <A HREF="day_of_the_dead.htm">DAY
     OF THE DEAD</A> (1985; mine and George's favorite of the trio), a 
    film that was panned by most Romero fans when it first came out, but 
    now seems to be on everyone's Top Ten list of horror films. My 
    personal favorite film of George's was <A HREF="martin_1977.htm">MARTIN</A> 
    (1977), which he was so happy to hear. People think that George only 
    made horror films, but he did much more than that, especially in the 
    beginning of his filmmaking career. As he got older, all production 
    companies wanted him to make was zombie films, so he did, but he also 
    threw a lot of social commentary into them. I am at a loss for words 
    for losing two great gentlemen, so please be patient with me when it 
    comes to writing their obituaries. I want them to be something

     Reporter</A>: In the upcoming drama <A HREF="blind_2017.htm">BLIND</A>,
     due out July 14, 2017, Alec Baldwin stars as a visually impaired 
    novelist who, after the fatal car crash that left him without his 
    wife or his vision, begins to rediscover life and his writing. The 
    Ruderman Family Foundation, an advocacy group for those with 
    disabilities, has come out against the movie's choice to cast Baldwin 
    as blind man, saying on their Facebook page that they are 
    disappointed with the casting, adding that the production is 
    &quot;once again overlooking the opportunity to cast actors with 
    disabilities.&quot; Note to The Ruderman Family Foundation from me: 
    Alec Baldwin is an actor and what he is doing is called acting. I 
    supposed if someone was dying of AIDS in a film, some advocacy group 
    would demand that an actor dying of AIDS play the role. People with 
    sight have been playing blind people since the beginning of film, so 
    my advice is to get over it. This political correctness crap is going 
    way too far for comfort nowadays. Ever notice that things that actors 
    and other famous people say on the internet are being torn apart by 
    people and groups you never heard of? Fuck them Alec Baldwin. You 
    keep doing what you do best. And let me ask this final question: Did 
    dwarves (or &quot;little people&quot;) protest Tim Conway in the 
    1980s for playing the dimutive <A HREF="dorf_tim_conway_videos.htm">&quot;Derk
     Dorf&quot;</A> in a series of Made-For-Home Video VHS tapes or on 
    Johnny Carson's TONIGHT SHOW? The answer: No they didn't. So get off

    viewing for a wider audience, giving people the chance to watch their

    all five versions of <A HREF="spider_man_2002.htm">SPIDER</A><A HREF="spider_man_2_2004.htm">-MAN</A>,
     along with 50 FIRST DATES, BATTLE OF THE YEAR, BIG DADDY, CAPTAIN

     HOUSE DOWN</A>.&quot; Now my personal opinion: Since most of these 
    films have been Rated PG-13 (and even PG!) when they were 
    theatrically shown (many of the films star Adam Sandler or Will 
    Ferrell), I fail to see the usefullness of cleaning them up. I can 
    now see it: A person in a movie says &quot;Fuck you!&quot; and in the cleaned-up
     version, the dialogue is changed to &quot;Fudge you!&quot;. And most 
    kids have already seen the uncut SPIDER-MAN films, so cleaning them 
    up seems kind of moot. I believe this was pressure put on Sony by the 
    religious right to clean up their films so religious people can show 
    these movies to their kids. No sex (The scene of Spider-Man kissing 
    Jane while he hangs upside-down will probably be edited out because 
    to the religious right, that is considered sex), no violence and no 
    foul language. Watch a Pixar film instead. Fuck them! (or rather, 
    Fudge them!); at least Sony makes sure you buy the original 
    theatrical version to get the cleaned-up versions. Many people, 
    including Seth Rogan, Judd Apatow and The Directors Guild Of America 
    (and myself) fail to see the point of all this. And companies have 
    tried this before, only to have all the major studios (including 
    Sony) shut them down in court. Now Sony is doing what it sued not to 
    be done to their films. Clean them up. I don't watch TV versions of 
    any movie unless it is uncut, unedited and commercial free on Pay TV. 
    Wise up Sony!</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    something a FBI Director never does, but Trump gladly kept him on 
    after he was sworn in. Now he fires him in the middle of a criminal 
    investigation (and suddenly said he was going to fire Comey after the 
    Clinton email server fiasco. So why didn't he?). No President has 
    fired the head of any head of any government law enforcement agency 
    during a criminal investigation, especially one that may involve him. 
    But here is Number 45 doing just that, because he can and it will 
    turn out to be the biggest blunder of his short Presidential career. 
    Politicians, law enforcement and most importantly, the people, will 
    question his timing of firing Comey. Did he come too close to the 
    truth for Number 45's own good? Or did he find out the real answer 
    and now that he is no longer an FBI agent, he doesn't even have to be 
    called to testify (but he will by the Prosecution)? Oh, Number 45, 
    how we will not miss you. You thought you could do anything you 
    wanted and then you hit a brick wall. I hope you serve some prison 
    time when the Trump/Russia illegal relationship turns out to be true 
    (and it is). NOTE: Comey wrote a letter to all his investigators 
    saying that he accepts his firing, but will miss the people he worked 
    with and the investigation. As with most letters, it is not what is 
    said, but what isn't said. Not once did he mention the President, so 
    that has to mean something. A few days before he was fired, Comey 
    asked for more funds and investigators to finish their investigation. 
    And then he was fired. Republicans are telling the people to 
    &quot;move on&quot; and forget about Comey's firing. Remember, they 
    are the great deceivers. <A HREF="trump_with_pope_photoshopped_photo_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trump photoshopped photo3 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="369" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Click On Photo To See Larger Version." BORDER="0"></A>And
     Number 45? Well, he is still Tweeting accusations and lawsuits that 
    Comey may have taped him, when, in fact, Number 45 tapes everyone 
    that comes into his office. Just another illegal offence to add on to 
    his list. And hey, Republicans, we will not &quot;move on&quot; until 
    this situation is taken care of in a proper legal way. And that does 
    not include anyone Number 45 hires to replace Comey in the 
    investigation. We need an independent investigation. We will not 
    settle for anything less. Good luck to the new impartial 
    investigator, Robert Mueller. If anyone can root out the truth, it is 
    him, but his findings still are reported to Number 45's 
    administration before anyone else. If I know Robert Mueller (and I 
    do), he will not settle for anything but the truth to reach the 
    public, whether Number 45 tries to cover it up or not. Number 45 
    better have a few pair of new underwear handy, because he is about 
    the shit the ones he's in. NOTE #2: Roger Ailes, the embattled former 
    CEO of Fox News, has passed away on May 18, 2017. Looks like Number

    being ignored when none of the news stations would show the 
    commercial (It's akin to yelling &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded 
    theater when there is no fire). This is what we can expect from 
    Number 45 for the next four years. They knew none of the news 
    stations would show the commercial because it is a blatant lie, but 
    they make the commercial anyway to make them look good and all the 
    news stations, besides Fox News (which is going through its own 
    problems, with Bill Shine, another FNC founder, being fired today, 
    but reasons were not given), as the bad guys. Any smart person can 
    see exactly how Number 45 is playing fast and loose with our Bill of 
    Rights and The Constitution, but his own lemmings, many born without 
    a working brain, are howling how our President is being denied his 
    rights. His rights of what? Spitting blatant lies? It is like showing 
    a man being killed live on SESAME STREET with all the children 
    watching it. Some things are not First Amendment issues, especially 
    when they are false. If Number 45 says something in public, the exact 
    opposite is true. UPDATE: April 7, 2017: Apparently every TV channel 
    has refused to show Donald Trump's Commercial. &#147;All of the 
    mainstream media television networks have decided to block the paid 
    placement of a campaign ad that celebrates the achievements of 
    President Trump in his first 100 days in office,&#148; railed 
    daughter-in-law Lara Trump. &#147;Apparently, the mainstream media 
    are champions of the First Amendment only when it serves their own 
    political views. Faced with an ad that doesn&#146;t fit their biased 
    narrative, CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC have now all chosen to block our 
    ad. This is an unprecedented act of censorship in America that should 
    concern every freedom-loving citizen.&#148; Are you kidding me? 
    Calling people names without a lick of proof is not only dangerous, 
    it is foolhardy and should be against the law. We all know how Number 
    45 feels about every channel except Fox News Channel (which Trump 
    seems to not care about all their sexual harassment suits), but he 
    and every Republican know that if a Democrat were to say the same 
    thing about FNC, there would be war in the White House. Everyone 
    knows this is a bunch of bunk put out there to keep our mind off the 
    Trump/Putin relationship (The organization that made this 
    &quot;commercial&quot; has no official ties to the White House). 
    &quot;Cock Holster&quot; is my new favorite term because it describes 
    our new President to a tee when it comes to Putin and Number 45. The 
    light at the end of the tunnel is not that far away. He is running 
    out of things to take our minds off Russia. And when that happens, He 
    will be forced out as President. Now he know how it feels not to be 
    accepted into one of his hotels because our bank statements aren't

    thing for all the wrong reasons. O'Reilly should have been fired 
    years ago for his views on women and non-white people in general, but 
    Murdoch kept him on because he was a moneymaker. O'Reilly (who is on 
    &quot;vacation&quot; in Italy) has lost so many advertisers since The

    minutes of major advertising per hour and now his show has just 3

    Vivek being appointed by President Obama two years ago)? Could it be 
    that Vivek is an Indian-American and we all know how our current

    are we going to let Number 45 get away with his prejudices? NOTE #2: 
    Now Fox News Channel anchorman Tucker Carlson (who took over 
    O'Reilly's time slot) is being accused by several women of making 
    inappropriate sexual remarks to them. It seems Fox News is in a big

     20, 2017: To prove that some Republicans are beginning to come 
    around to logical thinking (I think we all have Shepard Smith from 
    FOX News to thank for that), Tomi Lahren, who hosts a nightly show on 
    Glenn Beck's far-right leaning network THE BLAZE, has been suspended 
    for a week saying that she was Pro-Choice when it came to women 
    deciding what to do with their bodies when she was a guest on THE

    y&#146;know, someone that loves the Constitution. I&#146;m someone 
    that&#146;s for limited government,&#148; she said. &#147;So I 
    can&#146;t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I&#146;m for limited 
    government but I think the government should decide what women do 
    with their bodies. I can sit here and say that, as a Republican and I 
    can say, you know what, I&#146;m for limited government, so stay out 
    of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.&#148; She still 
    has the thought that we want to take away everyone's guns (nothing 
    could be further from the truth), but at least she spoke her mind on 
    abortion, which got her suspended for a week. She has been making fun 
    of her suspension on Twitter every day, so she may not ever come back 
    to THE BLAZE. People don't seem to realize that people like Glenn 
    Beck began their careers as comedians. They are entertainers, not 
    places to get real news. And as soon Ms. Lahren spoke something that 
    goes against every Alt-Right commandment, she was punished. Add to 
    that FOX News benching Judge Andrew Napolitano for telling lies about 
    the British wiretapping Number 45 with President Obama's approval 
    (He's back on the air as of March 29, 2017) and it looks like things

    on Twitter). But we have a long way to go. This is the country we are 
    living in now. Freedom of Speech means nothing anymore, especially if 
    you want to keep your job (at least in Tomi's case). UPDATE: March 
    27, 2017: What did I tell you? Tomi Lahren has been &quot;banned 
    permanently&quot; at THE BLAZE. One step forward, ten steps back. A 
    woman speaks her mind and a man tells lies. So who gets their job 
    back? A man, of course. Ms. Lahren has rightfully brought a freedom

    on Matt Damon's face as Casey walked up to the podium to pick up his

    moving backward, not forward. All the idiots that voted for him are 
    no better than Trump himself. Thanks for destroying our country, 
    mindless idiots. And for all of you that keep saying give the man a 
    chance and chill out: Fuck You!!! Trump will never be my President. 
    You want to know why? Because I have a brain and I use it. It doesn't 
    just fill the top of my head and is never used like Trump supporters. 
    They are drones who will chew their own arm off if Trump asked them 
    to. How will they be able to count to ten without taking off one of 
    their shoes? I saw a group of Trump supporters on CNN and the 
    interviewer asked one of the women Trump supporters how she can look 
    at all of his sexual assault charges and still support him? Her 
    answer did the same thing to me as it did to the female interviewer. 
    The female Trump supporter said (imagine I am saying this in my best 
    toothless hillbilly voice): &quot;We should overlook his past and all 
    support him for what he does in the future.&quot; Just like the 
    interviewer, I slammed the palm of my hand to my forehead. Support a 
    known sexual assaulter? Are you kidding me? It is enablers like these 
    people that are sending our country down the toilet, just like Trump 
    wants to jail or deport anyone who burns the American flag when the 
    Supreme Court already said years ago that it wasn't against the law. 
    Or when he calls the Chinese Premier out of the blue and sets back 
    relations with China 40 years (and then his cunt of a Press Secretary 
    says, &quot;Too damn bad!&quot;). Or when he declares that any 
    company that sends jobs overseas or to Mexico will be tarriffed out 
    of business. Or hiring businessmen and women to be part of his 
    cabinet (Linda McMahon as Small Business Administrator? Really? Or 
    Carl's Jr. and Hardee's CEO Andy Puzder as Labor Secretary? Are you 
    fucking kidding me?). Or when FOX News declares that the Democrats 
    are destroying this country, not Trump. Really, why are people 
    supporting an egomaniac/meglomaniac like this? Like I said before, 
    Trump will never be my President. Hell, I wouldn't even have him 
    shine my shoes (he'd probably steal one and then deny it, even though 
    it is on video). America is no longer the Land Of the Free, Home Of 
    The Brave. It is now the Land of the Fake News, Home Of the Mindless 
    Trump Idiots. In early January 2017, Trump held his first Press 
    conference and continually failed to take any questions from a CNN 
    reporter, barking out at him, &quot;You are Fake News!&quot; Really? 
    This coming from a person that makes up fake news (something which we 
    use to call &quot;lies&quot;) and expects everyone to believe him 
    (Even FOX News defended CNN!). His hypnotized group of mentally 
    deficient followers will believe everything he says, but I will never 
    let Fake News become the new truth. That is exactly what Trump wants. 
    CNN is not fake news just because they don't like Trump. Now on-line 
    site BuzzFeed is a totally different animal. They are the purveyors 
    of Fake News by publishing, in its entirety, the obviously fake 
    Russian report about Trump. All CNN did was report of its existence 
    and not mention a word of what was in the report. After the Press 
    conference was over, Trump went on Twitter (Where else?) to put down 
    CNN even more, saying &#147;CNN is in a total meltdown with their 
    Fake News because their ratings are tanking since election and their 
    credibility will soon be gone!&#148;. This is your new President,

    installed in the mid-80's, both knees replaced, surviving a 
    helicopter crash and having a major stroke in the 90's (which ended 
    his acting career [mostly] because it paralyzed one side of his 
    face), this strong old dog continues to write novels and 
    autobiographies, including the must-read &quot;The Ragman's Son&quot;.
     It is nice to write about legends who are still alive and Kirk 
    Douglas is a living legend. Some of his films that may interest 
    readers of this site are: <A HREF="holocaust_2000_1977.htm">HOLOCAUST 2000</A> 
    - 1977; <A HREF="fury_1978.htm">THE FURY</A> - 1978 and <A HREF="saturn_3_1980.htm">SATURN
     3</A> - 1980, but there are many non-genre films (like <A HREF="spartacus_1960.htm">SPARTACUS</A> 
    - 1960) where his presence shines brightly.&nbsp; Long may he be with 
    us. UPDATE: <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#KirkDouglas">Kirk Douglas</A>

     WITH THE WIND</A> - 1939; <A HREF="hush_hush_sweet_charlotte_1964.htm">HUSH...HUSH,

    was one. The 100-year-old two-time Oscar winner was named a Dame 
    Commander in Queen Elizabeth II&#145;s Birthday Honors list on 
    Saturday, June 17, 2017. UPDATE: June 30, 2017: On the eve of her 
    101st birthday, Miss de Havilland is not above suing the FX Network, 
    along with Ryan Murphy Productions, over her portrayal in the 
    excellent new TV Series <A HREF="feud_tv_series_2017.htm">FEUD</A>, 
    saying that it paints her in a false light, according to court 
    documents obtained by <A HREF="http://www.variety.com">Variety</A>. 
    The lawsuit claims that FEUD &#147;puts words in the mouth of Miss de 
    Havilland which are inaccurate and contrary to the reputation she has 
    built. For those unfamiliar with the series, Season 1 details the 
    feud between Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Jessica 
    Lange) had in front and behind the camera while making the film <A HREF="whatever_happened_to_baby_jane_1962.htm">WHAT
     EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?</A> (1962). Even though Miss de 
    Havilland did not appear in that film, she was portrayed by Catherine 
    Zeta-Jones in the series and was not happy with her dialogue or 
    actions in the series. She is a living legend and as much as I loved 
    the series (Season 2 is about the feud Princess Diana and Prince 
    Charles), I hope Miss de Havilland gets everything that is due to 
    her. UPDATE: Olivia De Havilland passed away on July 26, 2020 at the 
    age of 104.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     4, 2016: Again I have more bad news. My furry female feline family 
    member Allie passed away after 15 years of companionship this 
    morning. After my boy Gator passed away in February of this year, 
    Allie became my constant companion, giving me love when I needed it 
    the most. She made me smile, laugh, cry and show nearly my entire 
    range of emotions. For the first time in my life, I am truly alone. 
    Allie was unlike most female cats I have ever met. She didn't need </FONT><A HREF="allie_adelman_rip_2001-2016.htm"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/little allie one eye close up8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="MAROON">companionship,
     she WANTED it and would sleep on my chest every night. She also 
    missed Gator, but made sure that she kept me occupied to try and keep 
    my mind busy. She would play fetch with her favorite mouse (which I 
    buried with her in a handmade casket I made, right next to Gator), 
    went gonzo with a laser pointer I would use (Want to laugh? Use a 
    laser pointer on the floor and walls, but never in your cat's eyes) 
    and sit on my lap while I type on my computer. I think that is what I 
    miss the most: Allie asleep on my lap purring while I typed. And it 
    would be for hours. I just hope that if there is a Heaven and they 
    allow animals, that Allie and Gator are now playing together and 
    having the time of their deaths. They both gave me unconditional 
    love, something humans are unable to do and Allie took the helm when 
    Gator passed away. I never had two furry four-legged family members 
    like Allie and Gator and I doubt I will ever experience that feeling 
    again. Those that think that the death of their pet (God, I hate that 
    word!) means nothing don't deserve to have one. R.I.P. Allie Adelman. 
    There will never be a more beautiful and caring female family member 
    like you again. Thanks for all the good times and there were many. 
    Daddy will always love you (I made up the word 
    &quot;ultra-infini-love&quot; to describe our feelings for each 
    other. It means our love will never die, long after I retire from 
    this mortal coil.). NOTE: The reason why Allie is my family member 
    was simple. As you can see from the photo, Allie had two different 
    color eyes (it did not affect her eyesight) and I was born with only 
    one working eye. Allie saw me and licked me just under my non-working 
    eye and from that moment-on, she was part of my family.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

    2016: It took me a week to write this because it was one of the most 
    emotional times of my life, but my friend of 17 years, Gator, passed 
    away at the age of 17. Yes, Gator was my cat, but it was more like I 
    was his servant and I loved every minute of it. He was not only a 
    friend, confidant, playful attacker (When I would walk through the 
    door, I would find him suddenly attached to my leg, hanging from my 
    pants, but he never once scratched my skin. I did go through a lot of 
    pants though.), sleep partner, neck warmer and, most of all, someone 
    who was able to give me unconditional love in times when I needed it 
    the most. He seemed to understand me unlike any human being ever 
    could. He was my <A HREF="gator_adelman_rip_1998-2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gator in a bag2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="225" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>son
     and one of the most important family members that I have ever had 
    (My mother &amp; father not included). When he was younger, one of 
    his favorite things to do was go for a back ride. I would crouch over 
    and, the next thing you know, Gator was on my back and I would run 
    around the apartment with his two front legs on either side of my 
    neck, like he was going on a rollercoaster ride. One day last week, 
    as we were taking our normal one hour afternoon nap, I woke up but 
    Gator didn't. I&nbsp; cannot express in mere words how I felt at that 
    moment, but looking back, at least he died in his sleep and did so 
    while lying on my stomach. He will always be a part of me and I shall 
    never forget him. People have been telling me that 17 was pretty old 
    for a cat, but that's not the point. I nearly lost him in 2010 when 
    his back legs started to fail him. But my cat doctor, Dr. Niedermeier 
    (the best damn cat doctor in the world), diagnosed him as a diabetic 
    and I would have to give him daily insulin shots and special food. 
    Every morning Gator would lie down while I gave him his shot at the 
    fleshy part of his upper back. Not once in six years did he ever 
    scratch me. And within three weeks after being diagnosed, he was back 
    to his normal, playful self. When you have someone that close to you, 
    age doesn't make a difference. It is one of God's cruel gifts that 
    cats (and most other animals) don't live the lifespan of a human. 
    Gator leaves behind a younger sister, Allie, who also misses him very 
    much and the next day, she came to lay on my stomach to take Gator's 
    place when I tried to take a nap. What she did made me cry like a 
    baby and I'm not ashamed to say that I spent a good portion of last 
    week waiting for Gator to attack me as I walked through the door or 
    fart next to my face when we were sleeping at night (I think it was 
    his favorite thing to do). Gator, wherever you are, remember that 
    Daddy loves you and thinks about you every day. You were the best 
    friend a lucky person could ever have. I'm not a lucky person, but I 
    hit the jackpot when I brought you home from the shelter. Sleep 
    tight, son. Sleep tight. And remember people: Adopt from a no-kill 
    shelter. Giving love to any kind of furry friend will bring you years 
    of joy and satisfaction. Animal lovers will understand what I am 
    talking about and not think of me as a pansie for crying over a cat. 
    For those of you who do think that: Shame on you.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

      4, 2016: Nothing is Sacred Dept.: I am usually not against any film 
     being remade for a new generation, because old fogies like myself 
     will always have the original film to watch (Some idiots think a bad 
     remake makes the original look bad. It doesn't. Quite the opposite, 
     it makes the original the better film, that is all.). But then I get 
     news that the undisputed original thinker's film <A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPERIA</A> 
     (1977), directed by the always interesting Dario Argento, is being <A HREF="suspiria_2018.htm">remade</A> 
     with Chloe Moretz, Dakota Johnson, Tilda Swinton and Mia Goth to star 
     (Original star Jessica Harper is set to make a cameo). My question 
     (Besides being &quot;WHY???&quot;) is simply this. Why would anyone 
     want to remake the first chapter of Argento's &quot;Three 
     Mothers&quot; trilogy (which includes <A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Inferno1980">INFERNO</A> 
     [1980] and <A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MotherOfTears">MOTHER OF TEARS</A> 
     [2007]) and forget about the other two films (and the classic 
     soundtrack of Goblin)? And why such a classic film of the absurd and 
     colorful gel-colored lighting? It just makes no sense. What's next, a 
     remake of Argento's classic giallo <A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP
      RED</A> (1975)? It is slated to be directed by Luca Guadagnino 
     (Who?) and written by David Kajganich (Again, who?), based on the 
     original screenplay by Dario Argento and Daria Nicolodi. This is one 
     of those head-scratching decisions that studio's make. First it was 
     remaking classic Japanese horror films (like <A HREF="ring_2002.htm">THE
      RING</A> - 2002, and dozens others) until interest ran out and now 
     they have switched gears and are remaking Italian classics. They 
     picked the wrong film to start off with. Argento fans won't see it 
     and if it is a complete remake of the first film (like Gus Van Sant 
     did with Hitchcock's <A HREF="psycho_1999.htm">PSYCHO</A> - 1998), no 
     one will understand it without seeing the other two films. I predict 
     a huge flop but Amazon (who will distribute it) has faith in the 
     project considering the cast. Too bad no one today besides Argento 
     has the talent of Argento. Set for release sometime in 2018. NOTE: 
     Word is the film will be nearly 150 minutes long! UPDATE: I have seen 
     the film and I'm going to eat my own words. This is a <A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#Suspiria2018">terrific
      film</A> which pays Argento much respect. And Tilda Swinton? 
     Marvelous in a dual role, one of them most people don't know is her!</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     (who stars as &quot;The Giver&quot;) has been trying to get this film 
     professionally made right after he read it 20 years ago, with his 
     father, the late Lloyd Bridges, playing the Giver.

     wanted to direct my father in it, as a matter of fact, somewhere in

     Bridges) playing The Giver, Bud Cort narrates the whole thing, Beau's 
     kids, one is shooting it, one is playing Jonas. We did the whole 
     book, so that's around somewhere.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY"> We 
     get a peek of Lloyd Bridges doing some line readings for the film on 
     the combination DVD/Blu-Ray, but wouldn't it be great if Jeff Bridges 
     could find the first film and release it as a double feature with the 
     new version? I know that Lois Lowry would approve because she and 
     Jeff became good friends and I would be pleased as punch to see it, 
     whether it is good or not. Let's just hope it is not a lost film. And 
     just a word about color desaturization in a lot of modern films. In 
     the 2014 film, the lack of full color serves a purpose, as you will 
     see in the film's final minutes (check out the film's <A HREF="giver_2014.htm">posters</A> 
     for an important clue). While a lot of films do it mostly for 
     &quot;atmosphere&quot;, this film actually has a purpose for using 
     it. I really disliked the 2014 film the first time I saw it because 
     it deviates too much from the book (maybe it is best not to read the 
     book before viewing the film), but the more and more I watch it, I 
     realize that the message is the same and it works as a movie on its 
     own. If you have not seen the film, I advise doing so. Jeff Bridges 
     gives the performance of his life (you can tell this film means a lot 
     to him), Meryl Streep has never been nastier (and looks a lot 
     different than what she looks like in the posters, mainly because she 
     was working on two films at the same time), and the young cast 
     (including Odeya Rush [<A HREF="goosebumps_2015.htm">GOOSEBUMPS</A> - 
     2015] and Taylor Swift!) also do a terrific job. This is not a YA 
     (Young Adult) Film, but a film about being human and what it means to 
     be one.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     depends on what you think about the films. In my opinion, I think the <A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW
      Franchise</A> was one of the best franchises of the new Millennium, 
     misunderstood by most critics and, eventually audiences, who

     franchise for Halloween theatrical consumption (They grew tired of 
     those cheap found footage films, too.). Besides one very bad film 
     (SAW IV - 2009) the rest of the series were well-written and taut 
     horror thrillers with a lot of surprises. And they play as one 
     continuous story, too. Sure, they all may be considered partially 
     torture porn, but the films had complex stories and some very 
     inventive deaths, which were the decisions of those being killed. 
     Everyone who died in these film were given at least two choices and 
     some even survived. I am looking forward to another film and maybe 
     even more if it becomes a boxoffice hit. NOTE: The film was released 
     as <A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">JIGSAW</A> and did moderate

     cellophane wrapper that said &quot;<A HREF="physical_goods_still_rule_sticker.htm">Physical
      Goods Still Rule.</A>&quot;. That thought made me extremely happy

     invest $18.00 for the first three months of his streaming site, he 
     will send us three DVDs or Blu-Rays as a way of saying thanks! He 
     decries all the losses of the brick and mortar stores as a reason why 
     physical goods don't sell well any more (which is a bunch of 
     bullshit, since internet stores like Amazon, Screen Media Archives, 
     Oldies.com, Diabolik DVD, Vinegar Syndrome, Code Red and dozens of 
     others sell physical discs at prices much better than you can find in 
     any brick-and-mortar store). I'm all for Charles Band pitching his 
     new streaming site (where it will be the only place you can view Full 
     Moon films, including premieres before they make it to DVD or Blu-Ray 
     and Blue Underground &amp; Something Weird Video announcing 
     themselves as exclusives to the Full Moon Streaming site, increasing

     Charles Band hucksterism. Don't get me wrong. I like Band and he is 
     one of the very few independent filmmakers to survive through the 
     good and the bad times from the 1970's till today, but you can't say 
     one thing and do another without being called out on it.<FONT COLOR="GREEN"> </FONT>Dear
      Charles Band: Both streaming and physical media can survive 
     side-by-side. There is no reason to decry the death of physical media 
     (especially on a DVD!!!) when I bought it and I know I'm not the only 
     one who loves physical media. I am also of the mindset that if I see 
     something I watch streaming that I like, I ALWAYS buy the physical 
     media version of it. Just like I refuse to read ebooks (I love the 
     feel of paper between my fingers), I feel the same way about owning 
     films. Just the idea that my entire library of films resides on a few 
     terabytes of hard disk space makes my skin crawl.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

     Produced by Essanay Studios, the film, simply titled <A HREF="sherlock_holmes_1916.htm">SHERLOCK
      HOLMES</A>, stars William Gillette as the titular detective, a role 
     for which he was known around the world. Gillette is also credited 
     with some of Holmes&#146; trademark characteristics, including his 
     deerstalker hat, magnifying glass, and pipe. A nitrate dupe negative

     <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="3">According<A NAME="XFilesReboot"></A> 
     to <A HREF="http://ew.com">Entertainment Weekly</A> on January 17, 
     2015: Fox&#146;s new agenda is looking a lot like their old one. 
     Confirming some prior reports, the network&#146;s leadership says 
     they are seriously chasing a reboot of <A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
      X-FILES</A> and are possibly interested in bringing back <A HREF="prison_break_tv_series_2005-2009.htm">PRISON
      BREAK</A> too (along with yet another edition of <A HREF="24_tv_series.htm">24</A> 
     as well &#151; but that&#146;s another story). On THE X-FILES front, 
     Fox chairman and CEOs Dana Walden and Gary Newman say they have been 
     in talks with series creator Chris Carter about reviving the 
     supernatural procedural, which was a major hit for the network from 
     1993 to 2002. The executives also revealed they hope to have original 
     series stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reprise their roles 
     on the show. One thing all three titles have in common is they&#146;re
      properties of 20th Century Fox Television, which Walden and Newman 
     ran prior to adding the Fox broadcast network to their plate last 
     year.&#147;It&#146;s true that we&#146;ve had some conversations on 
     X-Files,&#148; Newman said. &#147;We&#146;re hopeful of being able to 
     bring that back at some point.&#148; Walden added: &#147;Gary and I 
     both worked [at 20th Century Fox Television] through the entire run 
     of THE X-FILES. It was a great experience. We&#146;ve maintained good 
     relationships with Chris, David and Gillian. We&#146;re very hopeful, 
     but it&#146;s hard. The actors are very busy. They have a lot going 
     on. Chris has a lot on his plate, so it&#146;s just trying to carve 
     out the time.&#148; Amazon recently declined to make Carter&#146;s 
     new post-apocalyptic series project <A HREF="after_amazon_failed_pilot_2014.htm">THE
      AFTER</A>, so the writer-producer may be more open to revisiting his 
     past. More problematic is that Duchovny has an upcoming NBC event 
     series, <A HREF="aquarius_tv_series_2015.htm">AQUARIUS</A>, while 
     Anderson has a recurring role on NBC&#146;s <A HREF="hannibal_tv_series_2013.htm">HANNIBAL</A>.
      Both actors would presumably have to get contractually clear of 
     their commitments to Fox&#146;s rival before signing onto an X-Files 
     relaunch. As for BREAK, the team sounded more skeptical of a reboot 
     coming together, but also very interested. &#147;There is some 
     speculation in the press about PRISON BREAK, which honestly was 
     slightly news to us,&#148; Newman said. &#147;Although we&#146;ve 
     made it clear over the years to the studio that we would bring PRISON 
     BREAK back in a heartbeat. It&#146;s probably the perfect event 
     series. If our old partners in that show are interested, that would 
     be great. &#148;It wasn&#146;t clear if the executives planned to do 
     PRISON BREAK with a new cast or not, but the show&#146;s stars 
     Dominic Purcell and Wentworth Miller are currently recurring as 
     villains on The CW&#146;s <A HREF="flash_tv_series_2014.htm">THE FLASH</A>.
      <FONT COLOR="BLUE">(I was never a big fan of PRISON BREAK, but since 
     THE X-FILES was [and still is] my favorite TV series of all time, I 
     would love to see it come back. It would be a dream come true, as 
     long as they kept the conspiracy theory plotline to a minimum. I 
     believe that is what killed the show [I like the duo tackling strange 
     monsters of the week]. I even went to see the two X-FILES movies [not 
     to mention the convention that came to NYC in 1998, where I met the 
     beautiful and warm Gillian Anderson], even if the second one was weak 
     when I first saw it, but it has grown on me over time. I really, 
     really hope this happens! - Editor)</FONT> UPDATE: It's now official. 
     New episodes of THE X-FILES will start to be filmed in the Summer of 
     2015, with both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson returning to 
     their iconic roles. The Bad news? It will air on FOX as a six-episode &quot;<A HREF="x_files_reboot_tv_series_2016.htm">Event
      Series</A>&quot;. I guess six episodes are better than nothing, but 
     it hardly puts a dent in audiences' hunger to see the duo back 
     together again, the first time since the 2008 theatrical film. Let's 
     hope that the ratings go through the roof and make FOX order more 
     episodes from original creator Chris Carter, who is overseeing this 
     Event Series. No air date has yet been set. UPDATE #2: FOX, in it's 
     ultimate stupid wisdom, will air the first episode at &quot;10-ish 
     p.m.&quot; after the NFC Championship Game on Sunday, January 24, 
     2016. The following night, THE X-FILES will have its time period 
     premiere at 8 p.m. on Monday. This raised questions about the 
     strategic value of both using that football game as a platform to 
     relaunch what is a very established property, while also 
     simultaneously burning off one-third of the network's inventory of 
     the six-episode limited X-FILES return. This can only do damage to 
     the series, since the first episode will not be DVR-friendly, because 
     it has no concrete start time (Look at what CBS does with their 
     Sunday series after football overruns. The one show that should start 
     at 10:00 p.m. usually gets canceled after airing there for one 
     season; even established shows like <A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI:</A>). 
     This could hurt the series overall, since if people miss the first 
     episode, they may not want to watch the rest (diehard fans will, but 
     new viewers to the show probably will not). Nice move FOX, you jackasses.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

     been in rock group Kiss for four decades. &#147;Horror films fall 
     into a genre that thrives on genuine passion, and I believe this 
     partnership truly capitalizes on that sentiment and supports our

     written by Matt Savelloni, follows a team of trained operatives who 
     find themselves trapped inside an isolated military compound after 
     its artificial intelligence is suddenly shut down &#151; and then 
     begin to experience strange and horrific phenomena. A director will 
     be announced shortly, with principal photography expected to start
